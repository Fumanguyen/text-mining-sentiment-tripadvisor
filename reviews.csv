"Our weekend at the Hyatt to celebrate our wedding anniversary was filled with surprises. The hotel upgraded our room, gave us a pass to the VIP Lounge and a couple of complimentary drinks to mark our special occasion. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, professional, courteous and gracious. Couldn't ask for a better way to make this an anniversary to remember.",20-Nov-18,5
"We stayed here 4 nights the standards met were higher than expected. The location was fantastic - couldnâ€™t get much closer to Union Square. Our rooms were spotless, very roomy and bed was extremely comfortable. View from window in15th floor was fab. We were allocated interconnecting rooms as we had requested and both rooms were lovely. I used the hotel gym which had an amazing view from 34th floor. The hotel staff were very attentive, friendly and made us feel very welcome. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again the next time we visit SF.",20-Sep-18,5
"The Hyatt is very central and convenient to walk to most places in the city which is a huge plus. However it wasnâ€™t the best stay Iâ€™ve experienced by far. The room that I was first allocated had 2 double beds (for just 1 person), was cramped and you can hear the street noise. This was particularly evident because of the current protests happening at several hotels in the area, it is very loud and disturbing so be aware that this is going on all day and night until about 10pm. Ask for a room on the Stockton st side. Itâ€™s a shame that the receptionist didnâ€™t mention anything about this when I checked in. I asked to be transferred to another room on the 2nd day, and it was rejected because they were booked up. On the 3rd day I asked again and the gentleman on reception transferred me straight away and was extremely helpful, even when I went back to check the room for my passport. Overall the king suite was very nice, the bed comfortable and the amenities all great. However there was a very bad smell coming from the drain in the bathroom that you could smell as soon as you walk in the door, luckily I spent most of the day away from the hotel, but it was very unpleasant. The room service food was pretty bland/average as well so Iâ€™d recommend going to a restaurant in the city or nearby as there are much better options available. ",19-Nov-18,3
"This hotel is in a great location. The hotel rooms seem very dated and the bathrooms have no counter space to get ready because the sink is too big. The showers have a hand sprayer instead of a big shower head making the shower just ok. There is a strike at the Marriott across the street making it very loud at times from 6am-10pm. The Hyatt tried their best to accommodate this. Overall, the hotel was ok because could use some improvements. ",18-Nov-18,3
"The location doesn't get much better than where the Hyatt is, next to union square, close to restaurants, shop and anything your heart can desire.The room was as you would expect of a luxury hotel: spacious, clean, large tv, good shower, electronic blinds and a spacious closet. I was up to the 7th floor and didn't hear many street noises, only in the background.Upon checkout, it appeared there was a mistake in my booking and they had expected me a day sooner (one night more). The staff was so kind to arrange things for me to get that night off the bill after I showed my paperwork. The only comment is about the breakfast. No complaints about the quality but it was incredibly expensive. A breakfast buffet is 34USD without tax and without tip. It came as a surprise to me and with a total cost of a whopping 43USD, the most expensive breakfast I have ever had anywhere in the world. Not worth it.All in all, I would stay here again...and get breakfast somewhere else.",15-Nov-18,4
"Dirty hallways, loud rooms, terrible restaurant food, over priced wine, treadmill didnâ€™t work in the health club. Not worth the money. Lots of other great hotels around. I will stay somewhere else next time",15-Nov-18,1
"Right by Union Square, can walk everywhere or take the trolley right from around the corner. Lots of food options. Hotel is nice and service is great. Don't do valet parking, not worth it since self parking is just across the street.",13-Nov-18,5
"Brand you can trust to deliver a superior experience. Great location with access to business centers, shopping, and fine restaurants. Staff went well above my expectations. With so many choices in San Francisco, I plan to look here first.",13-Nov-18,5
"We stayed in room 2124, an executive suite. The room was nice with a separate bedroom, electronic blinds and two bathrooms. Clean. Two robes and two sets of slippers. The tv in the living room wasnâ€™t working and they replaced it within the hour. The service is what youâ€™d expect from a premium Hyatt property. But I asked for a quiet room and this one is directly next to the elevator shaft. Not quiet. Also the room faces west and the Marriott hotel which currently has the most obnoxious protestors banging drums and screaming into megaphones from 7am till 9 or 10pm. Thankfully we sleep with a white noise machine regularly so between ear plugs and two phones blaring ambient sound we were almost able to drown out the constant audible assault. I have never been so happy to check out of a hotel. Sorry Grand Hyatt SFO but we wonâ€™t be back.",13-Nov-18,3
"Typical Hyatt and nothing wrong with it. We got our rooms on time though the check-in process was a bit slow. We had a very noisy room the first night and heard all the elevator movement. After we told them in the morning, we got moved during the day and they took care of everything while we were touring the city. Very good handling and customer service.Hint: order a quite room upfrontThe location is great for everybody who likes to discover a city on foot. You can walk everywhere from China Town, downtown, the cable car stations and even all the way to the Golden Gate bridge.",13-Nov-18,4
"The location is great, I stayed here for a conference and was able to get to all the local bars and nightlife no problem :) It's downtown SF, so it's crowded, noisy and you'll need to watch where you step, but this hotel is in the center of it all! Food and drinks in the hotel restaurants were notably bad, seriously, not even basic drinks were right, so you'll need to get out in the neighborhood, but you didn't come to SF to eat at a Hyatt anyways. Rooms v average, look like every other Hyatt, staff exceedingly experienced, professional and available to help with every detail. Valet and motor lobby well managed considering the challenge created by their location. ",11-Nov-18,4
Booked here with work and I know I can expect the same level of experience with Grand Hyatt no matter where I go. Check in was smooth and the room was great. Complimentary late check out and everything was lovely,9-Nov-18,5
"Room was very clean and people very kind, we did not use ac system because was very noise, really we did not need. The most important thing is that room was very clean. We request to change towels daily and they did. Bed was very clean also",9-Nov-18,5
"we stayed a total of 6 nights over two periods during our trip. We were only informed of some benefits when checking in second time example bottled water can be provided, high speed wifi access and phone calls including international calls can be made at no extra charge. please note also there is a potential problem in design flaw in your room table. there is a gap adjoining the wall and table which a piece of paper or small items such as earring can drop through which cannot be retrieved as the table is fixed and dropped items cannot be picked up from floor or side of table. A piece of paper fell in but unfortunately i could not take it out.guests staying there should be aware.",8-Nov-18,4
Staff was very professional! Concierge service was friendly and exceptional! There was a little bit of a noise which the Hyatt couldnâ€™t control as it was due to protestors at The Marriott! The quality of service was great! Really made the stay so much nicer and I would definitely stay at the Hyatt again! ,8-Nov-18,5
"We had a Bay view from our Room and that definitely was the highlight of our stay. The room was listed at 312 sq. ft., however it did not seem that large. We had the Sunday Brunch and were terribly disappointed. The price was $34.95 per person but the quality and variety of the food was very disappointing, we do not recommend eating at the hotel. ",8-Nov-18,3
Great location and very nice hotel for SF weekend. Friendly staff and clean hotel. Some other hotels had union strikers in front banging out catchy tunes beating on 5 gallon water jugs. Glad we were not affected at the Hyatt. The Grand Club option was very nice and would definitely do that again on my next visit. ,7-Nov-18,5
"We have stayed here three other times and prefer this hotel to many others in the SF area. The location is great (right above Union Square) where you are in the heart of Downtown SF as soon as you walk out of the hotel. Our first experience was great because we drove up to SF from the LA area. We were tired from a long drive and arrived earlier than our check in time. They noticed that and welcomed us and upgraded us for free to the King Club Access room without us asking for it. The Club Access rooms are only on floors 30-35 (highest five floors) and give access to the Club Lounge where you can have free drinks, water, appetizers, and a 360 view of SF. The rooms are modern and clean and the beds are helpful after touring SF. Check in was easy through their app, and you can also request room service from their app as well. Valet is right across the street in a garage for about $40/night. We chose to self park for $30/night. I've never experience too much city noise at the high floors. Staff has always been friendly and easy to work with and we are planning to stay there for a fourth time at the end of this year. Great location as you have Starbucks right across the street, and access to the trolley on Powell which is the next street over. Not that far of a drive to almost anywhere in SF.",6-Nov-18,5
"I had stayed at many Hyatt hotels in the US & all over the world and gave them excellent reviews mostly due to great customer service. The Grand Hyatt SF is the very 1st Hyatt that disappointed me. Customer service sucks right from the front door to the front desk, to room service. Hotel & room amenities do not reflect the word ""Grand"" Hyatt. Rooms are small and there's constant noise that sounds like a subway underneath. No slippers or robe available in the room. I asked for slippers, water, and more toiletries on our 1st night. Waited for almost 3 hrs. 2nd night, I stopped by the front desk before going to our room after a long day of touring SF w/ my family to ask for some bottled water for me & my family. BTW, we booked 2 rooms for this stay. The answer I got was that I could always call to order the items from my room. I said we just walked back in. The front desk lady repeated that I should just call from my room but that she will make the request to bring them up to our rooms. Waited for hrs until I found out from a family member that the items were brought to just 1 of the 2 rooms. Maybe they were short staffed? Or maybe the culture of the environment is just different? Or maybe we looked too plain or tacky that we didn't deserve the attention or service? All I know is that this hotel experience was far from grand from a Hyatt hotel standard. I will continue to book a stay at a Hyatt Hotel in my future travels but won't come back nor will recommend Grand Hyatt SF.",6-Nov-18,1
"No customer appreciation! We stay here several times a year and they still do not acknowledge that fact. We paid for a city view room and got, not the east side financial district city view, but the back of the building where there are loud protesters picketing at another hotel.When I called to relocate to a room with the view we paid for, we were told that this side of the building is a city view as well. Well, it is not. So beware, their upgrades are not worth the price as they bait and switch you to a lower grade room even though you pay for a view. They are more interested in their ""new eco-friendly"" practices than customer appreciation or service. Upon checking in, we did not get a ""welcome back, we appreciate your business"". All we got was a speech about eco friendliness and that we now have to pay an extra 25$ destination fee and all we got for that was a few coupons that we can't use and a map.We will now be staying elsewhere from now on. The Grand Hyatt San Francisco just lost a very loyal customer.",6-Nov-18,1
"Very poor sound isolation between rooms, especially in the corner units where there are three rooms with doors facing each other. One can hear every coming and going. Also, a surprising number of rooms are connecting rooms, with even normal TV usage being audible from your neighbour. Definitely ask for a non-connecting room here. Rooms are also getting pretty dated and could use some updates. Were kept clean though. Wifi was awful and had to use my phone tethering and chew through the data.Staff was a plus. They dealt with a 2am moaning/groaning wakeup from a passionate neighbour and promptly moved me so I could sleep and getup for my conference next AM.",3-Nov-18,2
Fabulous fabulous fabulous as always and a real treat and when we left forward to in San Francisco!We are always treated like special guest and the rooms are spotless and the service is excellent and the food is something we always enjoy.,3-Nov-18,5
Was pleasantly surprised at how great this hotel is..Great location on Union Square and was clean and updated. I've traveled and stayed SF many times and live not far away and this hotel exceeded my expectations,30-Oct-18,5
Fine hotel and great location. Grand Club was excellent as was the restaurant. I really appreciated the wide variety of free newspapers in the Grand Club. This hotel will be on my short lists for future stays in San Francisco.,30-Oct-18,5
"Stayed on 27th floor great city view. Classy place, comfortable bed. Shower and bathroom nice. Modern look, newer feel. Union Square is central to many places you would want to go. Sound from outside the room and neighboring rooms did seam to penetrate into our a room a bit loud.",30-Oct-18,5
"Nice location close to CVS, Starbucks, Apple Store, within walking distance to Market Street and Moscone Center. But if they assign the restaurant to go for breakfast and you go to a wrong restaurant, they will impose additional charge to your room. ",29-Oct-18,3
"Large rooms, with lots of nice touches. I liked the vanity area outside the bathroom and the bowl-like sink. It felt luxurious. Great location near Union Square. Surprised by their additional tourism fee. So include that in the budget. It's not in the cost of the room advertised.",29-Oct-18,4
"Great location-smack in the middle of Union Square. From one of the higher floors, the views are amazing. Other than that, I was underwhelmed. The hotel is badly in need of updating. Rooms are large but old and dingy. At $700-800 for a single room with 2 queens, I expected nicer accommodations. Room service is limited to â€œto goâ€ù style prepackaged items. For this hotel, itâ€™s all about the location and not much else. ",28-Oct-18,3
"Very comfortable hotel room with great location on Union Square. NEar major shopping, Powel Street cable car line, China town, restaurants. A great location for touring. Service was very good. Refrigerator ,coffee maker in room. VA let parking with also an option to self park in garage across street.",28-Oct-18,4
"I stayed at the Hyatt for work. The experience couldnâ€™t have been worse. First I was charged a more expensive room to accommodate for my check in. Second I was given a room on the 29th floor that was dated (from all the refurbished rooms). Third there was never complimentary water on a 350 usd a night plus tax hotel stay. Fourth breakfast was not included. Fifth the room cleanliness was non existent, towels smelled like humidity and sheets smelled like unwashed. Sixth the key never worked so I had to go back down every day to have it fixed. Seventh thereâ€™s been a strike for 3 weeks from the Marriott hotel and since 7 am you can hear the demonstrators scream because walls and windows are paper thin. Also you can listen to water in the pipelines and the small minibar be turned on and off. I definitely donâ€™t recommend staying in this hotel.",25-Oct-18,1
"The hotel has an unbeatable location right next to Union Square, thus allowing you to get anywhere by any type of transportation you prefer. It is also precious for anyone wishing to walk to very good restaurants and stores right at the heart of downtown San Francisco. The staff was always available, they would always offer you free bottles of water. A special mention goes to the ladies at the concierge who were very kind, professional, and full of invaluable directions for our days as eager tourists. Really a great stay in an unforgettable hotel for anyone who wants to be comfortable and at home when visiting the city.",25-Oct-18,4
I have stayed at this hotel several times. It is a great location on Union Square walking distance to many of the San Francisco sights and Moscone Center. The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable but a bit dated. The closet dresser is not really big enough to unpack your clothing. The hotel staff was great. They get the grand prize for the biggest bathroom sink I have ever seen in a hotel!,24-Oct-18,4
"hotel has a good location with close proximity to amenities such as pharmacy, restaurants,Stores etc and service is generally friendly. room is decent size. Nothing spectacular but it will fulfill all the basic needs. Visited the bar at L2. Happy hour rates are very reasonable. ",24-Oct-18,4
We arrived in town before noon and they were able to accommodate early check in luckily. There were protests at several hotels from another brand and the front desk staff warned us about that when going over room choices. The location right next to Union Square is great. The 1 thing I found confusing was that I only found free coffee in the lobby on Thursday morning but not the other 2 mornings. I might have drank coffee that was part of a convention I suppose. It seems like everywhere else I've ever stayed offered at least a cup of coffee.,24-Oct-18,4
"We just returned from a long weekend in San Francisco. It was suggested to me by a friend who used to live in SF that we stay in Union Square. She was right. This location is close to many high end stores, restaurants, bars, CVS, the Big Bus stop, etc. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and to our surprise, they had a room ready. They also offered us bottled water, a $30 food credit and a free upgrade for internet (we just had to have them take off the charges at check out). The ladies at the concierge were FANTASTIC - super friendly and gave lots of great ideas. There was a little food cart with drinks and pastries in the am which was convenient. Benches were out friend if you were waiting for an Uber or wanting to smoke. A nice, clean hotel and we would most definitely return. The location was wonderful as it was pretty central to everything and in a nice area. Being from out of town, my husband and I get nervous in a big city, but we had no problems getting around here. ",24-Oct-18,5
Annoying demonstrations from other hotel employees at Marriott/ Westin et al. All day and most of evening noise made it difficult to rest. The construction and trash and homeless/ begging on the streets while walking to convention was very disappointing.,19-Oct-18,4
"As frequent travelers, we have stayed at plenty of hotels. However, our pleasant experience at this property from the kindness of the staff to the quality of the rooms have made us loyal Hyatt guests. Our five day stay made us feel right at home. I highly recommend this property to anyone visiting the area. ",18-Oct-18,5
"The room itself was decent, the mattress was a bit worn and very hard. What was not pleasant was the outside noise of protesters all-day-long starting at 7am each day of my stay. The noise proofing on the room was pretty light, and this was not a great wake up call. Made the business trip difficult to get any rest. The location around the hotel was a bit sketchy, but that might be a description of San Francisco in general.",16-Oct-18,3
Satisfied with experience. View of city from room was not that great. Sleep was not that great as the traffic sound was audible in the room which was disturbing the sleep. Room aesthetics was quite good. ,15-Oct-18,4
"Itâ€™s taken me a while to write this review. But here it goes.I only stayed for one night, during a very long layover. The staff is amazing!! Great customer service, theyâ€™re really attentive to your needs. They also help you with extra stuff. Since I spent 24h in San Francisco, they helped me sort out fun activities for the day. The food at their restaurant is delicious!! A bit slow, but itâ€™s worth the wait. The hotel is located super close to the airport, but itâ€™s also rather close to downtown, so you can get around easily. Uber was a great choice for me. The beds are very comfortable; the rooms are fine. Itâ€™s not a vacation resort or anything. But for short stays is perfect.",15-Oct-18,5
"We stayed for 4 nights at the end of our LA to SF holiday. Check in was fast and efficient and we were soon in our room on 32nd floor. A good view from the room.We ate breakfast each morning. Although the restaurant is not large we were always seated promptly. Very good service and a good selection of hot and cold foods to start the day.We had a couple of drinks in the bar and the service again was excellent.The location is good for Union Square, although there is large amount of redevelopment going on around this area so it is a bit of a building site.Easy access either via walking or short Uber to all the sites.From the back entrance of the hotel you can walk straight into the Apple Store.Would stay again.",15-Oct-18,5
"Great welcome on arrival; the receptionist was really friendly and on seeing how exhausted we were promptly gave us free bottles of water and a voucher for a couple of free drinks at the bar - great start to our holiday.Our room on the 11th floor was fabulous - large, with two fabulously comfortable double beds, and a great view. It was spotlessly clean with linen and towels changed every other day, more often on request. The bathroom was a good size with a great shower and very nice toiletries, which were re-stocked on a daily basis.My one complaint would be that on one night we were unable to use the bar as it had been blocked off for the exclusive use of a conference group. If you wanted a drink you had to sit in the restaurant area and had a very limited choice of drinks - bottled beer or house wine. I expect better from a hotel of this size and quality. We like to round off our day with a drink in the bar and this was a disappointing end to an otherwise fabulous day. A small irritation but worth noting. I appreciate that conferences provide a good revenue source for large hotels but this shouldn't be at the expense of other guests who have paid good money to stay there.",14-Oct-18,4
"This is a wonderful hotel in an excellent part of downtown. It is walking distance to several great restaurants and shopping. And the cable car stop is within the same block, making it very easy to get around the area. Itâ€™s also a beautiful and well kept hotel. Highly recommend.",14-Oct-18,5
"I don't think anyone is reading reviews for this hotel because they wonder if it's sketchy or not. Spoiler: it's not. The bigger question is probably whether or not it's worth the money. I'd say it is. There are certainly cheaper hotels in San Francisco but you might not get a bathroom, or the location might be weird (the Tenderloin is right off of Union Square after all). After looking into prices at all of the nearby hotels, the Grand Hyatt actually isn't even the priciest, and you know you're getting a nice hotel.Check in was quick and friendly. I booked under two reservations due to using Hyatt points for one night and they had already combined the reservations with no issue. They gave me several bottles of water and let me know I could come back and get more if needed any time. I like that! Though the tap water actually tasted perfectly fine to me so I didn't end up grabbing more.The room was actually bigger than I expected for the location. I know hotel rooms in the Union Square area aren't going to be huge. We had friends over and the room was plenty big enough for 4 adults to sit comfortably. The only weird thing with the room was the fact that there was no light upon entering. There was a light switch near the door but it wasn't actually connected to anything. Since we checked in late the room was pitch black and we had to open the door to get enough light to try to find a light in the room. We just didn't turn the lights near the bed off after that, so really not a big deal; I just felt it was an odd oversight.Aside from that, the hotel was perfect. The location is great, right next to Union Square. There is a large convenience store (CVS I think?) right on the corner next door, which was super handy. There are a million food options nearby and a Bart/Muni stop just across the park.I will just mention that I think the ""destination fee"" is a giant rip off but I realize many hotels in many cities are charging it now. I found very few hotels in SF that weren't charging one so this isn't particular to the Grand Hyatt. On a better note, you get a food and beverage credit here, so if you actually use it you can mitigate the fee.As I said, I do think this hotel is worth the price tag. It's not the cheapest for sure, but it's also not the priciest, and you know you're getting a quality room and an awesome location.",14-Oct-18,5
"My wife and I were traveling for a convention. The hotel is within 10 minutes-walk to Moscone Center. Safe and very good location. Rooms are clean, comfortable and hotel service was above average. Good food.",11-Oct-18,5
"One of the best experience we had at this hotelStaff, customer service, location, rooms everything was perfect will definitely use this hotel if we every cisit san francisco highly recommend this to everyone",10-Oct-18,5
"I have stayed here many times in the past 12 months. While currently undergoing lobby renovation, you would not know it. It is quiet, clean friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for its great central location. ",10-Oct-18,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is in the perfect location in Union Square. Stayed there for 5 days on business trip, staff in various departments was amazing, very attentive and polite. The Rooms are very spacious and kept clean. Hotel can get very busy at check in, but they do a good job in expedite the process. Hotel is very close to Macy's, Apple store, various high-end boutiques and Market st. Hotel have a nice lobby to relax. Donâ€™t forget to check out the 36fl for the view of SF. If you are visiting or have an event, I would recommend the Grand Hyatt SF.",9-Oct-18,5
"Overall stay was ok, given its Grand Hyatt and the price I paid, expectation was higher but I must say the house keeping was prettt disappointing as the service during my 1 week stay was inconsistent- either missing the floor towel, 1 less bath towel or not replenishing the shower gel though was empty! Room delivery is expensive (USD7) - of course I didnâ€™t not want to pay!",9-Oct-18,3
"Our check-in experience was great. We were notified immediately when our room was ready. Upon coming back to get into our room, we requested our luggage from one of the gentlemen who handled the bags and he was extremely rude. He took the tickets and just said ""What colour are these?"", I told him one was grey and the other black and before I could even detail the luggage, he left me speaking to myself. He came back with the bags and I said ""I wish you would've stayed so I could describe them to you to make things easier"". Mid-sentence he cut me off and said ""That's fine."" and just dismissed my comment. No more dialogue was interchanged. Someone working with guests this closely should have more tact and be courteous. This was the first thing I remembered about my stay and it did not reflect well on the Grand Hyatt.",9-Oct-18,4
"Picked the Hotel mainly for its location and it was well worth paying that bit more .We'd booked a king room with bay view which was comfortable and clean albeit a bit tired , views from 23rd floor were great.Staff and check in were efficient but check-out was chaotic and took around 20 minutes and that didn't include any time waiting in a queue . That said it wouldn't deter us from staying again or recommending the Grand Hyatt to others.",9-Oct-18,4
"Our family booked a bayview room for four nights. Very good location in the union square and the view from room is very beautiful especially at sunset. However the room is quite small especially the bathroom, for us with two young kids. Fairly clean room, but you need to call for bottle water supply. It happened the Marriott staffs cross the street were on strike that week and they started their protest at 7am every morning, very annoying, but at the checkout the front desk lady gave us a credit of $40 as gesture which was still very appreciated. For valet parking it's expensive for over $70 daily, just as tips for those who need the parking, there is a public parking right cross the street which costs you only the half.",8-Oct-18,3
"Rooms are very spacious and modern, the staff is friendly and has a lot of expertise. Drinks and food can be consumed on the 1st floor in a very attractive and modern / urban set up. The hotel is located in the very centre of the city, with the financial district to be reached within 5 minutes and Nob Hill about 10 walking minutes away from the main entrance. Another advantage (besides a very friendly staff and prime location) is the fact that you are able to safely park your vehicle with assisted self parking just around the block.",8-Oct-18,4
"Pretty good overall experience, nothing out of the ordinary but as expected. Everything works and is clean, food is what I extended to the price same with service. I stayed during dreamforce, and the location was key ",7-Oct-18,3
I stayed in the grand Hyatt San Francisco from the 3rd I have never been to a hotel that doesnâ€™t have a slipper or a bath rub in the room You have to ask for everything even the shower cap I spent more than 20 minutes waiting for that Thus is a main thing to be in the bath room I canâ€™t understand why itâ€™s like this Itâ€™s so so annoying.,6-Oct-18,2
"Located right in the heart of downtown San Francisco, it is not cheap but for Frisco itâ€™s a bargain. The accommodations are nice. Not fancy but much better than most chain hotels. The lobby is graced with beautiful artwork and if you have access to the concierge room it is exceptionally nice with wonderful food. The best part is the bed; first class.",5-Oct-18,4
"Hotel was clean, but soul-less. Staff were minimalistic. Breakfast room sits approx 30 people, for a 34-storey hotel! No time to stand in line for breakfast, we have Meetings to go to! Kitchen breakfast lady swearing at guests in Spanish as if no one understands...",5-Oct-18,3
"We stayed 6 night at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco in September. Excellent location and Hoel staff are super friendly and very helpful. The housekeeping staff does an amazing job to keep the rooms spotless. Located just a stone throw away from Union Square and China Town. You will find good shopping and restaurants closer to the hotel.Check in & Check out process is seamless. The doorman's at the front door is very helpful. I had to use the business centre for 30 minutes on a weekend and the front desk staff were very professional even accompanying myself and my wife to the 2 nd floor which is closed on weekends. They made our stay very comfortable. If you can get a bay view room, you will have an awesome view of the San Francisco Bay from your room. We will stay there again on your next trip to San Francisco.",5-Oct-18,5
"Disappointing - very noisy, you can hear everything from the neighbor rooms!!! room rate differences between booking confirmation and folio - very annoying and took a long to explain and to get the understanding of Front desk staff. ",4-Oct-18,3
"When a hotel get's it right it's hard to babbler in a Trip Advisor Review. But since there can't be a ten I would have to say the breakfast restaurant is rushed, there were 100 waiters, ok maybe 50, alright just ten but they were always on the go and the food was so so...........everything else was great. Nice staff-even the 2,000 waiters at breakfast were nice. My room was immaculate, clean, everything worked-even the TV for those who read my yuck Viceroy review. Elevator was quick and OMG I was able to speak in the elevator on a call-ok that's a but rude but it worked. Definitely would stay here again.",4-Oct-18,4
"let's talk about waht was wrong, the door to the bathroom could be completely closed.the light at the foot bed is not working.And it is so noisy from the street and clim....I think it is not at the level of the price",3-Oct-18,3
"The Hotel is very central to all places of interest. The Concierge Staff is extremely polite and knowledgeable. I was disappointed by the size of the rooms and the weird sliding bathroom door made of glass, with no lock. Disturbing for co-occupants at night.",2-Oct-18,4
"My girlfriend and I loved this hotel. The bed was the best we'd slept in for a long time. Huge and comfortable. The staff were onhand and always happy to help with little bits and pieces (printing a document, borrowing an HDMI cable etc.). We were only as high as the 8th floor and even then the views were quite good. Judging by the viewing deck on the 36th floor, the views from higher rooms over Union Square must be amazing.There were even some nice little touches like housekeeping arranging our toothbrushes and shoes in little rows. Not something I'd expect nor is it a big deal but little touches like that are always noticed and welcomed.Ronald on reception was great and very friendly.One thing I would note as I'm sure others have, our booking (via booking.com) made no mention of the $25 per night resort fee that we had to pay on top. You do get some small benefits (namely $10 credit per day at the Starbucks/restaurant) but it would have been nice to know this up front.In any case, it has made me much more likely to stay at Grand Hyatt hotels in future. Felt well worth the money all round; and the location right on Union Square is perfect for walking around the city, getting a bus/cable car/BART etc...",2-Oct-18,5
"Hotel is well overdue for a major refit.Disappointing for a Grand Hyatt.No restaurant at our time of stay. Food at the bar very limited and poor service.Great central location and close to restaurants, shops and transport.",2-Oct-18,3
"Very disappointed with the reservation process, the room (no robe, no slippers, lights not working properly, no view, no amenities). Hyatt is resting on laurels of years gone by and have become so corporate and heartless for the guests. The new loyalty program is so confusing in name and trying to use the benefits or free nights is nearly impossible. We have decided to change to other brands as it seems Hyatt does not value the customer but rather looks at profit over quality. ",2-Oct-18,3
"Always looking for something bad, but couldn't find it at the Grand Hyatt. Asked for a quiet room and got it. The automatic shade was way cool. Great Union Square location. My stay was absolutely outstanding!!!",2-Oct-18,5
Great room in a great hotel. Our room was quiet and was clean - overlooked Sutter St. Larger than some rooms in SF. Location is superb - in the middle of the Union Square area. Plenty of nearby restaurants and shopping -- close to cable and trolley lines. Doormen were a great help in entering the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.,2-Oct-18,4
"Excelent location near Union Square, restaurants, ideal for shopping. Walking distance to most locations. I would recommend to anyone visiting the San Francisco Bay Area. Great views from rooftop. Excelent choice!",2-Oct-18,5
"We stayed two nights at the hotel. The hotel is located in Union Sq. 5 min, very close to all department shops and 5 min from Powell Brat subway station. We were party of four. The room with two queen beds can accomodate two adults and one to two teens. Sturback cofee shop is infront of the hotel to take your morning breakfast. ",30-Sep-18,4
"The hotel is at a perfect location, everything within walking distance and when you walked too far, easy enough to get a cab. The hotel has a nice bar on the second floor if i recall well. We rented a car while we stayed there, which i regret, it mainly stood parked in the parking garage next door for the 3 days we were there. Make sure you take plenty money SF is expensive and don't trip over the homeless people, sadly there are many.",29-Sep-18,4
"We stayed here beginning of sep for a week , we were on the 17floor hotel in great location to everythingRoom big and adequate althoigh didnt like adjoining room nxt doorStaff pleasent &informativeI would say rooms need updated but didnt spoil our holiday, over all i would give it 3 stars",27-Sep-18,3
"We visit San Francisco quite often and the Hyatt Union Square is always our hotel of choice. The hotel staff is excellent--registration, luggage assistance, Club level service. Whenever we travel with grandchildren they request the Hyatt as a treat!",27-Sep-18,5
"The location is fantastic, the staff beyond exceptional ( Ira Trinchera, lounge staff and concierge). Hotel itself needs to be renovated, does not have the Grand Hyatt feel. The staff made the stay better than it would have been. Club lounge not too big but excellent staff, breakfast in the restaurant good. If the hotel matched the staff quality this would be an exceptional hotel.",27-Sep-18,3
"Hotel is at a great location, very walk-able from the BART station and close to other transit lines. I was at the airport at 4:30am that morning and arrived at the hotel at noon. I was allowed to immediately check into a room on the 6th floor. The room faced the back of a building and was beside the ice machine, but neither affected my one-night stay. At this point I valued the extra time to rest and freshen up more than a view!I returned early in the evening after checking out some of the city and ordered room service for dinner. The lady whose name I forgot but starts with ""M"" was delightful and we shared a laugh when she thought I ordered ""chicarron"" when I really just wanted ginger ale. Dinner was promptly delivered, I was advised I could not add a tip to my bill as it was hotel policy, which left me to tip in cash which I did not have enough of. Ended up tipping just under 10%, which considering the expedited delivery, warranted at least 15%. I hope they reconsider this policy, I hate short-changing good customer service.I needed a shower before heading out to an event later in the evening, however the shower head fell off the handle when I turned on the water. Called downstairs and the agent was very apologetic and less than 10 minutes later, maintenance came up and took just 2 minutes to fix the shower! Came back from my event and had a wonderful sleep, perhaps the best I've had in weeks. Check-out the next morning was quick and efficient. I had breakfast at One-up and had a side order of sausages, lovely scrambled eggs and a slightly overpriced, but otherwise tasty smoothie. Service was courteous and efficient.All in all, stay was great, I'd love to come again and stay longer.",25-Sep-18,4
Nice hotel and very friendly and helpful staff. I loved the location and we were able to walk everywhere we decided to go. The price was comparable to others that I felt werenâ€™t as nice or located right in the middle of everything to do. The city view at night was fantastic.,25-Sep-18,5
"The location of this property couldn't get much better if you want to stay close to EVERYTHING in San Francisco. The hotel staff is very friendly, helpful and curteous but it's crazy expensive to stay here. We were there for a conference and, for instance, they wanted over 1 100 USD for coffee for 14 people (we decided to go to Starbuck's across the street instead) and when we needed a HDMI cable for the conference room that we had rented, they charged us $335 for LENDING us one. They cost around $15 to buy ... Of course the $335 included a guy that brought the cable to the conference room and two pieces of duct tape used to tape the cable to the floor to prevent us from tripping on it. Still, the extra $ 320 felt a little like a scam.",25-Sep-18,4
"We were here for two nights and it was a good location for the Union square area. The rooms were a decent size but a little outdated but the staff was great. The front office manager, Polina, was nice enough to give us an upgraded room to celebrate our anniversary and a bottle of champagne. Great service!",24-Sep-18,4
"We just loved this hotel and its location to everything. We were greeted at check in by Neil and he gave us his business card in case we needed anything. That was a very nice touch. The room was nice with amazing views. The club room was very nice and the food and drinks were great, but the deserts could have been better. The only complaint we had was that the elevators were very noisy in our room. It didn't bother us during the day, but at about 6:30 in the morning it was tough to sleep because of the noise. We will be back, but hopefully in a different room next time.",23-Sep-18,5
"We stayed here for 3 nights in Sep 2018. The rooms were spacious and clean and the staff were great. We ate twice in the restaurant (once for breakfast and once in the evening) and really enjoyed the food. The hotel is conveniently located, making it easy to get around the city on foot. Although we really enjoyed our stay here, we did have to move room due to noise on the 1st and 2nd night. We were in a room with a door connecting directly to the room next door. You could hear every movement and noise from the room next door. When we spoke to reception, the staff were polite and helpful in finding us another room. they also pointed out that it was a known issue with the rooms (thin walls).",23-Sep-18,4
"What a location on Union square.Very cooperative & efficient staff.Conceirge service is very helpful.All major stops for hopon hopoff & cable cars very close.Shopping areas,Restaurants,Pubs are in close proximity",22-Sep-18,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is a fabulous location. Its very central to the city centre and shopping centres. We found it very easy to gain access to transport and it was a short walk to tours and dining experiences. The staff were all genuinely friendly and amazingly helpful, they couldn't have done more to help us. The concierge desk went above and beyond with their service, friendliness and helpfulness and provided some fantastic suggestions for entertainment and dining experiences. The same can be said for all the staff we interacted with. Overall it was an amazing experience. ",19-Sep-18,5
"The door staff were fantastic went above and beyond to help us with luggage and local restaurants. At first I thought we were in the wrong hotel as the foyer looked like a 3 star hotel.The female desk clerk (who was not wearing a name badge) that checked us in was rude and abrupt. I explained that my husband (who was with me) was a member and could she please add his membership number to our booking she said we had the cheapest room and would not add the membership number to the booking. Obviously she wasn't looking at our booking because we were in a Club Room which is NOT a cheap room highly overpriced I would say compared to other hotels with clubs. She also said this rather loudly so other people behind us could hear what she said making us feel very small indeed.Our room was great and had a great view of the fog rolling in every afternoon. The Club staff were unwelcoming. Other hotel clubs we have gone to the manger of the club has always approached us when entering and shown us around so we are familiar with everything. This manager couldn't even say hello at anytime we were there. Breakfast was ok nothing outstanding here and the coffee was so strong the spoon stood up in the mug, disgusting. On our second morning there were no tables, so we waited 30 minutes and went back up and still no free tables so we went without breakfast on that day. Not once did the staff approach us and ask us for our room number so they could call down when there was a free table. This would have to be the worst club I have ever been in and they couldn't have made us feel less welcome if they tried.This was the first leg of our month holiday and I felt like it had already been ruined by rude staff. So glad we were getting on a ship that day or I would have checked out and gone to another hotel.",19-Sep-18,1
"The location of this property is fantastic to access the best sites of SF. The cleanliness and service is great! We have stayed at this property a couple of times, and will continue to book this property for future visits to SF. The concierge desk was helpful in booking a couple of experiences we had not had an opportunity to experience on past visits. Their recommendations were perfect!",19-Sep-18,5
"No problem with the Hotel (currently the reception is being renovated so check in lines are long).I am a Hyatt Explorist and spend about 50 nights a year in Hyatts.Unfortunately they have introduced their ""Destination Fee"" of $25 per night as an added cost. For this you get nothing of value and have no choice of opting out. They offer up to $10 food/beverage discount (I don't always want to eat drink at the hotel, premium internet (I already get this as my explorist status, discounts on bikes (I'm 62, here on business, and I don't ride bikes!!) Etc. The list goes on.Basically it's a con.To counteract this ""Fee"" should I decide to utilize any hotel service I will nop longer tip at the hotel. I explain to the staff that this is not a reflection on the service I have received and add a note on the receipt that the hotel should pay the tip out of the ""Destination Fee""A shame on Hyatt for implementing this con.",19-Sep-18,1
"Excellent hotel to stay at if you visit San Francisco. Fantastic customer service and delicious breakfast. Highly recocommend as option to stay at. Location extremely good gives you the chance to walk freely to Union Square, China Town and Little Italy",17-Sep-18,5
"Modern room design with automated lights and shades, feels luxurious. Located on union square next to the flagship Apple store. Short walk to the cable car, upscale shopping and financial district. Full service hotel with all the amenities, staff provides fast check-in and luggage assistance as well as valet parking.",17-Sep-18,4
"Restaurant closed, no room service, food service limited to a few bar snacks at certain times - hardly a 5-star hotel. Certainly not up to Hyatt worldwide standards. Location ok, clean, comfortable room.",17-Sep-18,3
"Nice staff greeted me as I checked in. They arenâ€™t overly pushy, which is nice. The hotel room is spacious and the washroom was clean. Room service is overpriced, as is the restaurant. Itâ€™s a better idea to eat out. Fitness centre was small, with only 4 weight machines and several treadmills and ellipticals.",16-Sep-18,4
Absolute bad price performance ratio. Very old fashioned. Rooms in the 70s style. Bad service. Very noisy rooms. Unfriendly check in. No recognition of membership. Concierge absolutely unfriendly and without any service. ,14-Sep-18,1
"If I could give this hotel 6 stars I would! We stayed here 4 nights and the hotel is very modern and spotless. Very comfortable feeling and vibe at the hotel, not like a typical 5 star when sometimes Iâ€™d feel like everything is a bit try-hard. The staff: Every single staff member couldnâ€™t be more friendly and helpful. A gentleman at reception helped me print my boarding passes off for my flight when I was struggling, the door men helped me with what I was looking for when all the receptionists were busy, the house keeping staff arranged my cosmetics on a towel next to the sink and left my bed untucked as they noticed thatâ€™s how I liked it but kept my brothers tucked in. Every staff member is ready to help you to give you the best experience possible.The room:The room sizes are excellent and always spotless. The WiFi worked great even when steaming videos, the rooms had coffee machines with Starbucks coffee, a decaf option and tea options, the supplied toiletries are good quality, the hairdryer and iron are good quality. The rooms also have automatic blinds which is a nice touch so you can look at the city whilst still lying in bed.The TV in the room allows you to connect your phone to watch Netflix or YouTube to stream movies and as I said the WiFi is great to use for streaming. I didnâ€™t realise until our last day so didnâ€™t get a chance to do this but itâ€™s a great option for a night in! The hotel:The location of this hotel is literally right in the middle of everything! All of the shops, department stores, bars and restaurants you could need are within walking distance. Less than $10 in an Uber to get to/from Fishermanâ€™s Wharf too.I canâ€™t comment on the restaurant or bar as we didnâ€™t use this. There was chilled complimentary water bottles whenever you wanted them delivered to your room or you could run down to reception to get them. The gym has all the basic equipment you need and itâ€™s on the 35th floor with amazing views! Overall: Amazing hotel with excellent and attentive staff members that go beyond what is expected, this is truly a 5 star hotel! If I ever visit San Francisco again I will 100% be staying here, I couldnâ€™t recommend it enough.",13-Sep-18,5
Unfortunately this Hyatt in San Francisco did not deliver what we expect from the Hyatt brand.Pre-made food delivered to your room off a limited menu with no options.Loud corridors and rooms that security did not address.Just not what I've come to expext from the Hyatt brand.,13-Sep-18,3
"Having arrived on a long flight from the UK, my wife and I took the BART from the international airport to Montgomery Street and then had an easy 10 minute walk to the hotel. We were quickly checked into our room, #2816.The room was spacious with lots of storage and a great view towards the sea (past other skyscrapers). There was a desk, 2 easy chairs, foot rest, large bed, TV, iron & board, safe, fridge, electronic blind and a single-cup coffee machine. The lighting was good, particularly each side of the bed. There were also motion sensitive night lights each side of the bed. Despite having a request for a quiet room on my reservation, we were given a room with a connecting door â€“ certainly not conducive to quiet conditions as we were disturbed by noises coming from the adjacent room. On one occasion they returned at 0200 and on another day had the TV on until past midnight.There was a separate alcove with a make-up/dressing table which led to the bathroom. This had a sliding door which left a gap of 5-10mm at the end and therefore did not seal off the bathroom properly from the rest of the room. The bathroom had a shower over a bath and a ferociously flushing WC! Toiletries were green tea and cucumber scented. We found the bath a little springy when having showers. Also contortions were needed to access the toilet paper when sitting on the WC!We had chosen a rate which gave us access to the club lounge on the 32nd floor. This was excellent, helped considerably by the helpfulness of the pleasant staff there (particularly David). Breakfast included yoghurt, fresh fruit, scrambled egg, sausages, bacon, breads, pastries, bagels, super smoked salmon and cereals. The only minor criticism is that the scrambled eggs quickly got cold. There were coffee urns and hot water for tea. The temperature of these was always hot but the hot water was never boiling and not really hot enough to make a good cup of tea. There was also an excellent coffee machine which used fresh beans. Hors dâ€™oeuvres in the club lounge started at 1700 daily, until 1900, and changed daily. These included various salads, meat loaf, sausage & pepper casserole, beef & pasta, chicken/beef fajitas, dim sum, etc. This food was tasty and plentiful but could have been hotter. After ~1925, cakes became available. Despite the hotel being full, we did not find the club lounge too busy. One of the best features of the lounge was wine at $3 and sprits at $4 â€“ both bargains considering the price of them in nearby bars/restaurants. The only negative aspect of the lounge was the background noise being overloaded with competing noises from the 2 TVs and taped music. The lounge was also open during the day for small snacks, soft drinks and coffee/tea.Wifi was good and it was great having USB ports, good for recharging devices, at the bedsides.Bad points worth mentioning are finding a half-open bottle of water in the fridge when we arrived and housekeeping not doing our room until after 1600 on two occasions (out of 5).The hotel was a 30 minute walk to the waterfront and 2 minutes to Union Square.I would stay here again without hesitation.",13-Sep-18,4

"We usually stay at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero when we go to San Francisco, which is several times a year. Last weekend, the Embarcadero hotel was fully booked of reasonably priced rooms, so we decided to try the Grand Hyatt on Union Square. It is in a more urban environment than the other hotel, yet ideally located if you like to shop (the new Apple Store is next door, and Nike is across the street). It is also a longer trek from the BART station if you like to use BART to get around. There is also a 24-hour CVS store across the street, which is a great convenience.As for the hotel itself, it was really lovely, very clean and chic looking. It has only one main entrance, which is a plus in terms of keeping the place secure for guests. We had a king-sized room, and it was spacious with a desk area and sitting area. There are night shades which are controlled at the door entrance and at both sides of the bed. I must admit it took us a bit to figure out where the controls were. There is also a room safe and small refrigerator. The bath has a modern look with a visually interesting oblong sink. I also like the lower bath tub side, which makes it easier to get in and out of when you shower. We had several meals and drinks in the One Up bar and the food was very good and a nice retreat from the very busy Union Square area. We had breakfast in the restaurant and it was very good, too. We were very happy with the stay and probably will use from time to time. I was very tempted to reserve the Executive Suite, which has two baths.",12-Sep-18,4
Vacation was great and the staff was nice. The bar was great and the view was outstanding. I would recommend this location to others and I also would recommend that you not force people to make comments. ,11-Sep-18,4
"Grand Hyatt SF Has a great atmosphere, I felt like it was very clean & safe. Loved the Bar! Our room was a disappointment bc we were located close to the elevator, the nosy and vibration had us waking up frequently! We both had terrible interrupted sleep all night long:(",10-Sep-18,4

"Situated on union square this hotel is ideally located for the retail & commercial centre of San Francisco. Rooms are clean & well appointed. We booked a city view room which had a panoramic view of the downtown area.Staff at the hotel were courteous & attentive. Check in & check out was quick & easy.The only downside & not a fault of the hotel were the large numbers of vagrants in the surrounding area were intimidating. Unfortunately, this is appears to be a common feature of many urban cities in the world. I would consider staying here again should I visit SFO in the future",9-Sep-18,4

"After a horrible delayed flight to SF, I finally went to the hotel to check in and immediately received a seamless and friendly check in at the front desk. And their customer service kept getting better. I originally requested a microwave and they delivered in a few minutes. The next day I requested a humidifier and again, received it in a few minutes. Housekeeping came and cleaned up every time I requested it. The staff will greet all their guests and even on the elevator, they will ask to see how was my stay. This is one of the best hotel stays I have experienced and will reserve next time I visit SF.",9-Sep-18,5

"Located right next to Union Square, this hotel provides easy access to shopping, dining and transportation. It is within walking distance of China Town and a short ride (or, if you like to walk, a slightly longer walk) to many other parts of the city. We took advantage of Cable Cars, Trolleys and buses to get us to the places we needed to go. The hotel is also located a few blocks from two BART stations, so that form of transportation would also have been easy to use.To a person, the hotel staff is welcoming and accommodating. They were immediately responsive to any request we had. The Concierge staff is one of the best I have encountered, with special accolades to Joanna Husk.Our room was small, but suited our needs. The only reasons that I do not give this hotel a 5-star rating are: 1. No real restaurant to speak of. If you want to have a drink, it's adequate as a bar, but don't plan any major meals there. 2. The bathroom in the room lacks towel racks. The only place to hang anything is on two small hooks -- not enough to accommodate two regular towels, two hand towels, nor anything on which to hang a piece of clothing or a robe if you choose to change clothes in the bathroom.",7-Sep-18,4
"No mobile app room key. Was congested only in room. Loud doors all night. Weird sink and antenna lights. Convenient location. Creaky building from ""wind"". Couldn't go to 36th floor for views but it lets you try in elevator.l",7-Sep-18,1
"I was here for a conference last week and after I checked into my room, I found UNCLEANED hair all over my bathroom sink and counter. It was disgusting. I contacted the front desk and the front desk said they would send someone to clean it. They were not planning on upgrading me to another room or provide any other service to counter the negative experience. I waited 20 min and nobody came. Then I called the front desk again and asked them to send the manager. In the meantime the cleaning guy came and took a look at it and said that the manager should look at it because it was pretty gross. The manager finally came and she apologized but only advised that she can have the guy clean it up and that she won't be able to move me to another room because they are all booked for the night. Ok, that's fine. She DID mention that she may upgrade me to a room tomorrow and that she would also give me extra bonus points on my account. First of all, she never followed through with upgrading me to another room the next day. All in all, I don't think the customer service is that great. Clearly, it's not ok to leave uncleaned hair in a brand new room you check into and it doesn't seem like the employees here were that remorseful. Except the cleaning guy. He was very remorseful and kept apologizing to me. He was the sweetest. But other than that, everything else sucked. I've only had one other situation where a room was not clean when I checked in and it was a 3 star hotel. They were so sorry that they gave me and all my guests free room service breakfast for every morning I was there, upgraded me to a bigger room and gave me bonus points. This place is a 4 star hotel and I say their customer service when things go wrong is mediocre. Not would you would expect from a 4 star hotel.",6-Sep-18,1

"We did extensive review of hotels prior to our SF trip, the Grand Hyatt didnâ€™t disappoint us. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. I requested a 12 oâ€™clock check-in and the hotel accomated my request. While checking into my city view room, I mentioned this was my 1st time in the city, the clerk changed my room to give me a higher view. The only issue we had was the hotel ran out of face size towels for 3 days but we used hand towels and made it work. Thanks Hyatt.",6-Sep-18,5
"Whenever we visit San Francisco, we always stay at the Grand Hyatt. The hotel is modern, clean and in a great location. Staff is very friendly. The doormen greet you at the door as you check-in and when you return to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, they open the door for you greet you with a ""welcome back."" We never stay anywhere else.",6-Sep-18,5
"I stayed here in April, 2017 and provided a mediocre review then. Being a loyal Hyatt guest, I decided to try again. Sadly, there have been no improvements and this is the last time I will stay at this hotel. I would encourage others to avoid this property as well. Given an exceptional location (on Union Square) one would expect a special place, full of unique design and excellent offerings. Sadly, it is the polar opposite of that: dull, ordinary, and completely devoid of any acceptable food/beverage. The rooms are worn and noisy, very disappointing overall. The food and beverage is barely adequate. Perhaps this is not a concern given the location and surroundings, but it is inconvenient if one has to stay in to work. Frankly, the hotel feels budget in all aspects except for the meeting spaces. Having given this hotel two tries, I will make a different selection on my regular trips to San Francisco. ",5-Sep-18,2
No quality control in the rooms. Shower didnâ€™t work properly. Room dusty causing allergies. Bedside lamp didnâ€™t work. Our room wasnâ€™t even made up one day although we were out from 9-6:30. Front desk doesnâ€™t pass on messages to other hotel departments. Vegetarian options food wise non existent. ,5-Sep-18,1
We had a great stay here in San Francisco. The Grand Hyatt is a fabulous place to stay. All staff we came in contact with were polite and helpful. Being Hyatt members we were fortunate to receive an upgrade and our view from the 30th floor was spectacular. We took advantage of the Grand Club access and everything in there was fresh and well prepared. The rooms are nice sized considering this is a big city hotel. I love that our room didnâ€™t have carpet. The room was nicely furnished and the bathroom was modern with good use of space. Housekeeping did a fabulous job (donâ€™t forget to tip your housekeeping staff) maintaining our room. When we mentioned the first morning there that the toilet was making a very loud noise when flushing it was repaired by that afternoon. The location here is perfect - so convenient to everything . We used Uber a lot so didnâ€™t have a car that needed parking. We are sorry to leave this beautiful city and hotel - and we hope to be back some day soon.,4-Sep-18,5
"Booked using some of our rewards points. Rooms are of a good size, bed o.k., views good, shower over bath in a 4 star plus hotel is cheap.Service & menu here is really poor for the price. Restaurant menu for dinner was of veryaverage quality and expensive. Bar service, again considering price, was ordinary. Breakfast service is a farce with parts of orders forgotten, my wife told off by chef when told by waiter she could select 2 pastries as part of her order. We would not return to this hotel, San Francisco has so many alternatives better priced and no doubt with better service.",4-Sep-18,1

However, when we pulled back sheet on one of the beds there was a large yellow stain on the comforter. YUCK. On the positive side, great location and the staff is very accomadating and friendly.",3-Sep-18,3
Hotel is modern and room small but well furnished. Modern bathroom and adequate gym on 35 floor. The best thing about the hotel is the location. Itâ€™s in a busy neighborhood. Chinatown is behind it and within walkable distance. Lots of eatery around. Lots of luxury goods store around hotel too. Parking in the hotel is $36 self parking and in the $60s gor valet. We park diagonally across the front door at sutterstockton public parking. Itâ€™s $2/ hour. Actually works out about $10 cheaper for us bc lot of time we were out and about in our car. Downstairs in lobby thereâ€™s a small bakery that sells breakfast item at reasonable price. Would stay in this hotel again when we visit SF.,3-Sep-18,5
"This hotel was great! Right from check-in to check-out. Very clean, staff were extremely welcoming and made me feel as if I was the most important guest there. Would definitely recommend this hotel and am looking forward to a return stay.",2-Sep-18,5
"We stayed here couple of nights on the final leg of our honeymoon.Good points... room decent size, very clean, great location and the staff were exceptional friendly and helpful. Bar was great and again staff were notably great.Now the serious downside. The rooms have adjoining room doors with shocking sound insulation. We were woken by some ghastly women with a mouth like a fog horn who seemed to think acceptable to have her child also shriek and run around like being in a playground at 6am. Staff were super apologetic and moved us next day. Even with a quiet couple next door in the new room you could still here them talking.The cable noise from the lifts also transmits to the rooms.Shame poor / dated structure of the hotel diminishes the stay.At the start of our trip we stayed round the corner at the Nikko which on the face of it is a similar offering. No noise issue there and would stay there next time due to the structural issues at the Hyatt.",2-Sep-18,3
Donâ€™t be fooled by the glossy pictures - this place is dated beyond belief. Decor is hideously old fashioned and cheap. Overpriced and underperforming. Great location but severely in need of a revamp. All in all - very very disappointed ,30-Aug-18,2
"Perfectly situated just off Union Square. An excellent hotel experience with great service and very comfortable accommodations. Excellent breakfast severed in One Up restaurant, prices are reasonable for big hotel and location. Close to shopping, food, culture and entertainment. The Grand Hyatt will not disappoint.",29-Aug-18,5
"We have stayed at this Hyatt for over 20 years. Over the years they have made many changes -- and in our opinion not all for the good (we have found this true at many of the Hyatts we stay in). Several years ago there was a beautiful bar and restaurant on the top floor. That was replaced with these services being moved to the mezzanine. Now the only breakfast choice in the restaurant is a $34 buffet or an unattractive coffee and small selection of pastries in the lobby area. From what we were told, the restaurant will be closing and there will only be a grab and go sort of thing. For a relatively nice hotel I think this arrangement is very unappealing. ",29-Aug-18,3
We lobed this hotel. The view from the room was perfect. The furnishing in the were immaculate. The bed were perfect for a great night sleep. Walking distance to all shopping. Apple store. Nieman Marcus. Barney's. Nike. Westfield mall. Parking close by for $35. Highly recommended.,29-Aug-18,5
Had stayed here before and enjoyed it. Has a great location near chinatown and Union Square shopping. Rooms are large and nicely appointed. Service was excellent. Only gripe is the $34 breakfast buffet. We actually thought it was a free Hyatt Place breakfast since there wasn't much more to choose from.,29-Aug-18,4
"We have just completed. Fabulous staff here. We were lucky enough to get a room over looking Union Square. Room was clean tidy and with great air on. Hotel is a perfect location. Close to union square and shopping. Close to China town and the Trolley car terminus on Powel. The staff were all fabulous from the door man who greeted us, the reception staff and cleaners. Would definitely recommend staying here. ",28-Aug-18,5
"Got a bayview room and the view was spectacular. Coit Tower, Alcatraz, China Town right in front of us. We pulled chairs over to the window and just sat and looked. Very friendly and helpful staff from the doormen to the bellmen to the front desk to the maids. Service was instantaneous. Great restaurant recommendation from the concierge. The rooms were very nice and well appointed. Assisted self parking was the way to go. We would definitely stay again.",28-Aug-18,4
"Fabulous location on north side of Union Square, next to all nationAlly known shops and best restaurants.Service is impeccable. Concierge service has all the answers to any question you may ask. Club floor is worth the extra expense if you want superb service. Been staying here every year for past seven years.",27-Aug-18,5
"Stayed in the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for six nights in August 2018. Great Hotel in a great location, right next to Union Square, we stayed for six nights, room only.All the staff were very polite and helpful especially the concierge, rooms good size and cleaned every day, beds comfortable and complimentary tea, coffee and water in the rooms.The hotel is a great location to visit the Pier 39, Golden Gate Bridge and all the attraction, my wife loved all the shops. We used the public transport to get around and found this great value for money,Really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt",27-Aug-18,5
Actually stayed during Pride in June. Great Service and Support for the LGBT Community. They even had an arch made of balloons in rainbow colors at check-in. The only con was not enough option for late night food at there little gallery.,27-Aug-18,4
"The staff is very helpful and kind. Everyone I encountered was willing and happy to assist me when needed. The hotel is very typical for a Hyatt, but rooms are on the smallish side. The hotel is in an excellent location, close to Union Square, but 1/2 block away to not be crazy busy outside the main doors. I had a room near the elevator shaft and that wasnâ€™t ideal. It sounded like a constant windy day with the swoosh of the elevator, but it could have been a lot worse/louder.",27-Aug-18,4
"Quick weekend getaway for us and grabbed the G. Hyatt at the last minute. It worked out perfectly as a base very close to everything we had time for. Nice rooms very clean, efficient check in and check out excellent staff inside and at the door. Had time for a couple drinks at the lounge again very nice bar staff and good drinks. All in all a good choice. Would stay at again.",27-Aug-18,4
"We really enjoyed staying here as it was a great base for what we wanted to do. Our room was really spacious compared to UK hotels of this size which was brilliant as we werenâ€™t on top of our luggage etc. The room had a large TV and a fridge which was really handy for our needs. The coffee machine supplies were topped up everyday which was a nice touch for us as we were room only and it was good to start the day with a coffee in our room. The housekeeping of the hotel is up there with the best that I have seen and the hotel staff were very friendly, efficient and willing to go that extra mile. Some of the local attractions nearby that interested us were, Union Square, Tram cars and China town. Macyâ€™s and Saks are a few minutes walk away for those that enjoy shopping. Recommend ",26-Aug-18,5
"This hotel is located in a great area (Union Square). I found it a great vantage point to check out all the tourist spots around town and shop at the same time. I was able to do a lot in the area and it was a really nice area to be around. Staff are also really nice and accommodating.I would definitely check your rate that you pay though. I originally booked a standard refundable fare and the price lowered 2 days before my check in and saw that they had lowered the price and made a quick call into World of Hyatt to update the pricing.Some Cons:Lyft/Uber is a bit difficult to use because the drivers tend to not know where the entrance to the hotel is. Sometimes, I had to jaywalk across the street to reach my uber/lyft.There are not that many elevators, and most rooms are hard to get to via stairs. I was there around Christmas and they had the University of Arizona (?) football team there for a bowl game and so the elevators were definitely crowded. So depending on when you go, you might have to wait for an elevator.",24-Aug-18,4
"Nothing really stood out to me as bad or great. It was fine, but only fine. I could have received the same care/treatment at other less expensive hotels. The rooms were clean, the staff were friendly, but no one went out of their way. ",23-Aug-18,3
"I won a free stay at a work conference. The hotel was conveniently located by Union Square, Little Italy and Chinatown. Staff was always pleasant and very accommodating. Would definitely staff at the Grand Hyatt again. ",22-Aug-18,5
"This Hyatt property has discontinued room service so if you are traveling for business and want to work in your room, better bring take out. Also on windy days and nights, the building creeks loudly. The upper floors are the most unsettling; you cannot sleep well. Finally, valet and door service can be tardy if not frustrating at times. All that said, the hotel offers comfortable beds and staff are pleasant. Fairly safe with a few homeless folks around which is par for course in San Francisco these days. Make sure to check the Union Square Concert schedule before booking this property unless you want the added ""pleasure"" of a rock concert in your room. There's also construction in the area with drilling starting at 7:00 ish in the morning. ",20-Aug-18,4
Only have great things to report about his hotel. The location is ideal. Check in was courteous and efficient. We obtained connecting rooms as requested. The rooms were perfectly clean and the beds very comfortable. Nice view of Union Square. On Saturday AM we called to complain about a noisy AC fan. A technician arrived within minutes. He returned to change the fan motor at a time convenient for us. Now that's service!,20-Aug-18,5
"Pros- Location - so easy to get to the main attractions and excellent food and shopping at the doorstep- Service - attentive and courteous service at all times- Nice, neat and fresh room- Good bed, good pillows- Effortless check-in/check-outCons- Our room on the 28th floor (upgraded) had a shared door to next room and the neighbouring noise came through such that we had to call front desk to request they intervene, twice. Which to their credit they did, promptly and firmly. I think and upgraded room shouldn't be sharing a door to another room unless its adequately soundproofed.- The Aircon fan made a clanging noiseI would stay here again without hesitation.",20-Aug-18,4
"We stopped here as a family of 4 in August as part of a 4 week long Californian adventure. We have 2 young children age 6 & 4. It is everything you would expect of a Hyatt. The front of house were friendly and informative, plenty of people to help you will luggage, valet parking (which was super quick) a superb breakfast selection, or a quick snack selection in the lobby area if you preferred. The hotel is situated one row back from union square, right behind the Apple shop. Amazing location. The rooms were small, but exactly as you would expect of a city hotel, they were clean and the bed the comfiest I had ever slept in. The rooms were serviced daily. Would definitely stop here again if I visited SF.",19-Aug-18,5
"Nice hotel , well situated in Union Square, SF. Rooms were updated with artsy furnishings.Staffs were nice and helpful. Would stay here again except parking is ridiculously expensive.Location is excellent though as it is close to lots of trendy shopping places in SF.",19-Aug-18,4
"We arrived at the Grand Hyatt late morning and the front desk staff greeted us warmly and allowed an early check in. Off to a grand start! Unfortunately, the room was dirty and seemed as though it hadn't been used in awhile as there were hairs and dust in various places. Once again, the front desk staff was great and sent a housekeeping representative who offered to tidy the room but because it really needed a thorough cleaning I asked for a room change and was graciously offered a much better room than the original. Throughout our stay, we found the staff to be grand; amazingly friendly, helpful and gracious, without exception. That being said, I've stayed in other Grand Hyatt's and this one is not so grand any more. I'm sure it used to be but it's a bit run down and needs some TLC. The rooms are decent sized and the beds were very comfy. The online room description said we would have robes and a fridge in the room but we had neither. There's also no room service as they are changing their food selection options. The location is very convenient. Overall, I'd stay there again because of the staff and location but just be aware that if you've stayed, for example, at the Seattle Grand Hyatt, you may be a bit disappointed.",19-Aug-18,4
"I have been to this Hyatt multiple times and this is one of my favorite hotels. The hotel is in a great location, right on Union Square, accessible to Moscone Center, dining, shopping, and trolly cars. The rooms are clean and very nice and the staff is great. All the food I have had at the One Up Restaurant has been excellent.",19-Aug-18,5
"We visited Grand Hyatt and were happy with our check in process; however, weâ€™re a little disappointed with the cleanliness of our room. Our toilet was extremely dirty and I ended up cleaning it myself. We also found staining in our desk chair and the coffee cup on the counter had hair in it. For the price that we paid we had hoped for a cleaner room. However, the lobby and conference area was beautiful and we enjoyed San Francisco and the location of the Grand Hyatt. ",19-Aug-18,3
This is a very good hotel to stop in while in San Francisco it is centrally located and easy to get to and from the rooms are very comfortable and quite they were also very clean only one thing they need more tea facilities not everyone drinks coffee and a supply of milk would be helpful although there are lots of places to get your own close by. it was close to the cable cars and most of the tours company I would recommend this hotel,19-Aug-18,4
"I stayed at The Grand Hyatt with my two boys in July and loved so much about it! Elaine, at the concierge desk, was incredibly helpful in putting together great excursions for us! Our room felt like a little slice of heaven after a long day of walking; comfortable with awesome beds to rest tired bodies. The hotel restaurant has delicious options for late night dining and the location worked great for us! Two blocks from the gates of Chinatown and a short uber ride from the piers (walked one way & Ubered back).",19-Aug-18,5
Well placed in the heart of SF. Rooms felt a little tired. Limited amenities in room - ask for them! Parking is difficult- even concierge parking can have quite a queue.It seems you need to keep asking if you want things - not your normal Hyatt pro-active help.,18-Aug-18,2
"Stayed in June 2018.Staff were very welcoming on check-in, we booked a king room but unfortunately were told their system was incorrect so they didnt have one available for our first night. They put us into a double room for the one night and offered us cards for free drinks at the bar for compensation, very friendly about it and organised to move all our luggae into the king room the next day.Bar/restaraunt was quite nice, we didnt eat there but we saw the food and it looked delicious. Location was great, close to union square and shopping was a couple of minutes walk away. Staff were great on check out, offered us a later check out to accommodate us as we had a very late flight out. Had a nice view from our room, out to the city.",17-Aug-18,4
"The hotel is centrally located in Union Square and right outside you can catch a cable car, walk to shops and restaurants or catch the Big Bus around the city. Everyone is very helpful and love the doorman.",17-Aug-18,5
"This hotel was close to many things & ubers were easily obtainable for the far away things we wanted to see. The rooms were very neat and tidy, the employees were very friendly and helpful. Now if they could only insure the weather! ",17-Aug-18,5
"Went to San Francisco for a conference and stayed at the Grand Hyatt. Can't say enough about how nice our stay was. Hotel is clean, rooms are quiet and it is centrally located for a lot of shopping and muni bus and BART.",17-Aug-18,5
"This hotel is in a great spot, close to a lot of shopping, restaurants, and things to do. They offer you free bottles of water which is nice. The front desk is very attentive and whenever I asked for something, it was delivered within twenty minutes each time. The reason I don't give them five stars is because of hidden fees. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.",16-Aug-18,4
"The location is excellent as for all hotels in Union Square.However the rooms are a bit small for a ""grand Hyatt"". For the same price the rooms at the Hilton are more spacious. Only a small restaurant in the hotel, but being in Union Square perhaps you don't need more....",15-Aug-18,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for my husbandâ€™s birthday in August 2018.The Good:1. Our Executive Suite was very spacious with two bathrooms! Having two bathrooms saved so much time getting dressed each morning.2. At check-in, they saw it was my husbandâ€™s birthday on his ID. They surprised him with complimentary champagne and fruit! Additionally, at check in, we were given vouchers for free drinks and appetizers at the OneUP restaurant!3. Housekeeping was thorough and punctual.4. The hotel is in a great location. Itâ€™s close to dining, shopping, Union Square, China Town, and other sites.5. The bed was very comfortable.6. We loved have the ability to control lights and window shades with a touch of a button!7. There were comfy robes in the room.8. There was a small fridge in the room to keep our drinks cool.The Bad:1. NO ROOM SERVICE! We were so disappointed to learn that this Hyatt has no room service. Room service, especially for breakfast, is one of our favorite things of staying in a luxury hotel. Iâ€™ve learned that Hyatt hotels are phasing out room service. This was a huge disappointment for us. Had we known, we never would have stayed here. We had a long day of flying from the east and were exhausted. We were looking forward to room service. They offer food you can purchase in the lobby but that just isnâ€™t the same.2. Our room (2024) had water dripping from a vent in the ceiling. We called the front desk and someone was immediately sent to our room. He explained that it was condensation from the air conditioning unit. He wiped up the water. The water continued to drip after he left. Thereâ€™s a water stain on the wood floor that suggests this has been an ongoing, unresolved issue for quite awhile. The next day, the front desk called to find out if we still had the leak. We didnâ€™t.There were many things to love about this hotel. However, we will not stay here again because we enjoy room service, which is unavailable at this hotel.",13-Aug-18,4
"I stayed three nights at the Grand Hyatt. The location is perfect for San Francisco, you are one block from Union Square shopping and no more than a $10 uber/lyft ride away from key sights! The front desk team is on-point, check in was quick and the staff manning the door were always friendly & present to help. The room itself was clean & smartly furnished. I visited the bar which served quality cocktails and had a good selection of beer & wine. The fitness center on the top of the hotel is a little small but has fantastic views. The only area of improvement would be the elevators, it sometimes took longer than I'm used to for one to arrive. I would recommend staying at the Grand Hyatt.",13-Aug-18,5
"We enjoy coming to the Bay Area and staying in San Francisco. The Grand Hyatt and Centric Hyatt are both very convenient and fun places to stay while heading to AT&T for the games! With friends and/or family, we always feel welcome.",12-Aug-18,5
The hotel is conveniently located a few minutes from Union Square. The cable car drives right by.The hotel offers valet parking which is important given the hotelâ€™s location.I was allocated a room on the 32nd floor - the same as the Grand Club.The selection was good with an evening honor bar and generous opening hours from 5:30 - 10 AM.A good business hotel right in the center of San Francisco.,11-Aug-18,5
"We spent a couple of nights here at the end of a Central California road trip. It was the perfect place to round off our holiday - central location yet hotel was peaceful, the staff were so friendly and helpful and the club lounge facilities exceeded our expectations - would definitely return.",11-Aug-18,5
"I have stayed here many times but after paying 500.00 for a room, last minute reservation, they tell me they are in transition and they no longer have room service, I will no longer be staying at this hotel for the price of the rooms one would hope to have breakfast or coffee brought to your room.",10-Aug-18,2
"Stayed in the Hyatt for 3 nights on a business trip. Good clean room and bathroom. Good toiletries and vanity kits. A tad to pricey and not a single bottle of water provided. Excellent staff - friendly, courteous and pleasant. Will definitely return for a business stay.",8-Aug-18,4
"Great location off the Union Square block and right next to a 24-hour CVS pharmacy store, which makes it super convenient for traveller to get things which they forgot to pack on the trip.Room is clean and comfortable. The club lounge offers great view of the city too.",7-Aug-18,5
the location is prime. The customer service is great! The rooms are nice as well. I highly recommend it. It's close to all the shopping. you can walk everywhere. it is centrally located. the hotel is nice and clean as well.,6-Aug-18,5
Just came back from San Francisco and my favorite hotel. They make each person feel special and go out our their way to make your visit special. Itâ€™s was our anniversary so they said we had a gift for you and we were able to pick it- we chose bottle of wine and fruit. They gave out complimentary water bottles every day (as many as you wanted). The room was very big and we had a small vanity sitting area. I would definitely come back. They made me feel like I was home. ,6-Aug-18,5
"Hotel staff very engaging. Location was central for our purposes. City View, high floor was spectacular. Stayed at hotel over 20 years ago, also stayed at Hyatt Embarcadero. Both great properties. Would revisit!",2-Aug-18,5
"We were greeting pleasantly and with a smile and it continued throughout our stay. It was a great property, super comfortable and excellent location. The staff we extremely helpful and most attentive. They made sure we all felt at home.",1-Aug-18,5
"Location was good, I suggest self parking if you have a car, cheaper and literally right across the street. Right next to union square and shopping if youâ€™re into that. Walking distance to china town. Would I come back? Yes, but probably next visit to SF Iâ€™d try the Regency right next to embarco to check that Hyatt hotel out.",1-Aug-18,5
"Easy to get around the city, bellhops are the best, housekeeping was great. I'd always recommend to friend/family. If you haven't been to SF this is a good place to stay to be able to see the entire city",1-Aug-18,5
Great place to stay. Perfect location with a close commute to all attractions in SF. Just a short walk or inexpensive Lyft/Uber ride to anywhere in the city. Staff was the highlight of the stay and their professionalism and courtesy despite being very busy was admirable.,1-Aug-18,4
"Stayed here three nights over a weekend and had a lovely time. Very close to Chinatown and other attractions. Check with the concierge for city maps and a written tour of some things to do near the hotel on foot. Cable car is very close, one block over. There is a hot dog and pretzel cart toward Macy's if you want a cheaper snack. The grand club was very nice. Food was good and plentiful. We had a bay view king room on the 27th floor. Amazing view! Would definitely stay here again.",1-Aug-18,5
Front desk very rude. I forgot my key in the room and was told by Spenser to get in the huge line of customers checking in. Bad business!!! Stay away. Please train your employees to do the right thing and go above and beyond the customers expectations.,31-Jul-18,1
"I really liked the hotel. The view is AMAZING, even better at night! . The rooms are quite big and clean.....love how close it is to everything.. loved the location as it is close to many shops and malls.",30-Jul-18,4
"Stayed here for 4 nights over a long weekend. The hotel is located on Union Square and near Chinatown so conveniently located for shops/transport. The hotel is very busy but despite this generally speaking the service was excellent and the check-in/out was quick and efficient. The service in the hotel bar was efficient but not very affable with poor communication from the staff. There are plenty of bars close by so I would recommend those are used instead.Used the gym which was very clean with modern equipment and fantastic views over the city. The only problem is the gym is far too small for the size of the hotel. It was difficult to get on any piece of equipment never mind those you want to actually use.The room was great. Clean, contemporary with a large flat screen TV. Housekeeping was good and the bed was very comfortable to sleep in. The only slight disappointment was the poor water pressure on the shower.Overall this is a large, busy and efficient hotel but lacking any charm and personal touch. I would recommend a stay here for those happy with this type of hotel and would rate it as 3.5 stars 'good' in between Trip Advisor's average and very good ratings.",30-Jul-18,4
"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 6 nights whilst on a recent business trip. For my wife, it was a marvellous location as it is near to all the major shops and boutiques around Union Square. For me it was quite convenient for business meetings in and around the CBD. Getting out from there to the Silicon Valley for meetings was not that difficult depending on the time of day. The hotel room on the 25th level was modern with a very comfortable double bed, has a coffee machine, and a safe deposit box. The bathroom has a shower. We did not take breakfast at the hotel as there are many restaurants, whuch opens early and close late around the area to choose from. Staff was friendly and helpful.",29-Jul-18,5
"We stayed for three nights and thought the hotel was great value. The room was a little on the small size but was very well equipped and housekeeping did a great job.The concierge were very helpful and we made use of the complimentary water in the lobby.We didnâ€™t eat at the hotel so canâ€™t comment on the restaurants.If having a high floor and a good view is important to you then pay to upgrade. We didnâ€™t and were given a room on the third floor without a view, didnâ€™t really matter to us though as we were out and about a lot.Would recommend this hotel.",29-Jul-18,5
"I usually avoid staying in hotels, but the Grand Hyatt reminded me of why hotels can be such a positive part of travel. The central location is within walking distance of many major attractions. The room was well-appointed and comfortable, and the service was excellent. It's not cheap, but neither is visiting San Francisco, and the Grand Hyatt delivers.",29-Jul-18,5
"Im sad that i had to check out today after our 5 day amazing stay in Grand Hyatt. Front desk Steve was very kind and helpful.Our room service lady Anna is the best. Thank you Anna Such a kind lady does her job to the top notch.

Good business hotel in the middle of the city where most places are walking distance. Room size is average and room amenities are limited compared to most hotels in APAC. You had to request a lot of things from housekeeping whereas most hotels would have it in the rooms as a standard.There's no swimming pool so I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a family vacation. But an ideal location for shopaholic.,26-Jul-18,4
"Well appointed hotel, nice, small rooms. Everything was clean and service was fine, location is pretty good. Booked through Luxury Hotel Collection so were able to check in early. We were assigned a ADA room which was a bit odd, but fine. Bathroom door are barn doors so they dont lock.",24-Jul-18,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 4 nights this past weekend, for my birthday celebration. The hotel is incredible, with sweeping views in every direction of the downtown skyline, and beautiful art installations all over. The staff was excellent, the first night we got there there was a large crack in one of the windows. We didn't think anything of it, but the next morning room service noticed it while cleaning and called someone in to take a look. They ended up apologizing profusely, and said they were going to take care of it right away and gave us the option to move rooms. We got upgraded to a bay view instead on a higher floor, and when we finished getting ready and was leaving the room not even an hour later, we saw the new pane of glass sitting outside in the hall waiting for us to leave so they could replace it. Talk about being on top of things! The grand club lounge is included with certain rooms, and it was also a wonderful benefit. We enjoyed free breakfast every morning, and snacks / drinks throughout the day as well as very cheap (honor bar) cocktails in the evenings. Loved that! The rooms are well appointed, and you can connect your phone to the TV and play your own content, which worked very smoothly. The hotel is in the middle of downtown SF, centrally located to everything and very walkable. Very deserving of 5 stars, we will most definitely be back!",23-Jul-18,5
"We recently returned from a trip to San Francisco. Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was superior. Our check in was seamless. Everytime we had any question about whereabouts, or directions, the staff at desk and lobby were very helpful, always providing a map, and good information. Upon checkout, Hyatt offered a shuttle to the airport for $55, only $5 more than taxi service. We wouldâ€™ve requested this service had we known it was available from airport to hotel. The location was great, and very safe. So, he price was well worth the overall experience. ",22-Jul-18,5
"We ended up with two double beds in a tiny room that did not have space for a 2nd chair; that meant the second person was either sitting in bed or on a small stool. This is why it gets the 'poor' rating on the room.  Other than that, this hotel has a great location, the staff is friendly and attentive.  We were unaware of the Grand Club, which another guest explained for us - the extra fee would make it worthwhile, covering breakfast, an evening happy hour with snacks, and access to a printer.",22-Jul-18,4
"This hotel is well located, near China town. It is at a walking distance from very nice restaurants too. Staff is helpful, rooms are clean and functional. We did not hear any noise coming from adjacent rooms. ",22-Jul-18,4
"For the past seven years, we stayed at the Taj hotel, located across the road from the Grand Hyatt, which we thoroughly enjoyed, particularly for its excellent and very personalised level of service. This year, I decided to try the Grand Hyatt for a number of reasons: favourable feedback from friends who had stayed there; more competitive room rates versus the Taj; and our growing frustration with the very poor quality of the gym at the Taj, which I had complained about every year for the past seven years, but to no avail. I was impressed with the Grand Hyatt, which ticked several boxes: check-in service is fast/efficient and the front desk was able to check us into it our rooms early; rooms were a decent size and well laid out; concierge service is excellent; good hotel bar; last but not least, the gym is bright and airy (with great views of the bay from its high floor) with a broad selection of cardio machines and weights machines. My key area of complaint was Housekeeping, which failed to provide evening turn-down service on three occasions despite my requests. This aside, the overall experience at the Grand Hyatt was very favourable. Indeed, I rate it as a superior hotel to the Taj despite the latter's higher room rates. We'll be returning to the Grand Hyatt on our next trip to San Francisco. ",20-Jul-18,4
"I stayed at this property for the Inman connect conference 2018. Great location, very centralized to all of the activities events, shopping, dining for the trip. Breakfast at level up was outstanding. Bell service was very helpful. Traveling on business as a female I have to be very careful about staying places that I feel safe and connected to everything that I need to do. This property served that purpose at a very high-level.",19-Jul-18,5
excellent location service and staff were very helpful their support in looking for us for every small small requirements made us feel very comfortable it was like we were in our own home thank you to all ,18-Jul-18,5
"This is a great location. I was in SF on business. Starbucks is served in the lobby and a full-service one is right across the street. The food is very good and shopping, entertainment and dining options are all close by. ",18-Jul-18,4
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco was the biggest rip off - overpriced hotel Iâ€™ve stayed at. My gosh. The lady at the front desk was very fake. She deceived us when we asked â€œDid we get a nice roomâ€ù. She replied â€œYes, itâ€™s on one of our highest floorsâ€ù which was true but didnâ€™t really answer our question whether the room was nice or not. You can be on the highest floors but have a crappy room. We did the paperwork and everything and got to our room. We were a party of 4. Room was tiny. We had 2 double beds and were barely apart from each other. The room was very old school and was not up-to-date. Not to mention the amount of money that we paid for that one night, but Iâ€™ll get to that later. Bathroom was very old and out of date. The water pressure in the shower was very low, it felt like you were showering in the droplets that come out of the shower head after you take a shower. Horrible. We were traveling from the other side of the world (over 20hrs on planes and waiting at airports) and we barely ate. We were very hungry so we called the front desk and asked about getting room service. The lady on the phone told us â€œIâ€™m sorry, room service closed 10mins agoâ€ù. HOW THE HELL can you be an international hotel that accommodates people that likely come from all over the world arriving at different times of the day, and have the room service close at a certain time. Unbelievable. All of us were enraged by this. We did order delivery pizza which we had to call ourselves as the hotel didnâ€™t even offer to take our order. Horrible service. After 40mins of waiting we got our food, it was decent. It tasted good since we were hungry. We then went to bed. Bed was comfortable, thatâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s earning this hotel a 2 star rating from us. We all agreed before going to bed to get up out of there early the next morning, as the hotel was so bad. We woke up, packed our stuff and went to the reception to check out and got the bill. Online, our bill was already a high $659 for one night which I AM EXPECTING was including tax. No, no no. We got a $778 bill. We were lied to by the hotel. Unless if the hidden taxes for the hotel was $119 which is hard to believe. Unless if they charged us for the water that they gave us upon check in. I was very disappointed with this hotel and itâ€™s value for money. I will never stay at this hotel again unless if I had to choose between motel 6 and this. Nor will I recommend it to friends and family. Never again. ",18-Jul-18,2
The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. They helped me to collect package posted to me at the hotel. They even forwarded a package which I did get it before I left. Very reliable staff and impressive service. Highly recommended. ,17-Jul-18,5
Two things you have to know about this hotel. It is very very expensive but you will also have the best and most comfortable time. From the staff to the interior to the restroom facilities (which I always pay extra attention to) everything is on a high level. Also it is perfectly located.,16-Jul-18,5
"This hotel has a great location right at Union Square. The staff is very helpful and courteous. The room had a great view with floor to ceiling windows that included Union Square and the bay. Beds were comfortable, the restaurant food was tasty although the menu wasn't very extensive. The concierge and doormen were especially helpful in hailing cabs and offering tips on dining, etc. The only complaint my grandson had was regarding the bathroom door. It was opaque glass, so when I got up early in the morning and turned on the bathroom light it disturbed his sleep! We walked to Chinatown and other locations that were conveniently nearby.",16-Jul-18,4
"Great location. You can walk to many major sites. Eateries, cable cars, excellent shopping, Chinatown all within 1 mile radius. The hotel offers beautiful views on high floors. The gym is well equipped and the beds are very comfortable. Highly recommend for couples. ",10-Jul-18,4
"The hotel is conveniently located tp Union Square and Chinatown. The lobby and bar are beautifully decorated. The Concierge staff was exceptional. The rooms were a clean design, comfortable, and cozy.",9-Jul-18,5
fantastic location and views of san Francisco...service is excellent however if you need help or suggestions talk to any of the front office workers....close to cheap eats and five star restaurants...easily walk to many famous landmarks....great sour dough pizza!!!,9-Jul-18,4
"Very good hotel right next to union square. Quick walk from Montgomery St BART. Great views over Bay from higher floors. Restaurent serves very good food though bit pricey. Good quality rooms, good service.",8-Jul-18,4
"1. The location is perfect.. a block from Union Square, Starbucks across the street, CVS on the next block, McDonalds around the corner, a couple blocks to China Town, easy walk to Pier 39, also walked to AT&T Park. It was a block to catch the Big Bus tour bus. 2. The hotel has a super nice lobby and entrance. The people who checked us in and out were very friendly and helpful. 3. The view from our room was amazing. 4. The room was clean and the bed bathroom were nice. It was a little dated and starting to show some wear in the carpet. 5. A lot of other places I looked at before visiting didnâ€™t offer air conditioning. I thought this would be a problem and picked Hyatt because it has air conditioning.. turns out you donâ€™t need it. After visiting Iâ€™m sure the other places wouldâ€™ve been fine. It is cool there and a crack window was plenty. 6. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It met all of our needs and we enjoyed it. On my next trip I might try another hotel just because I like to see new things. ",7-Jul-18,5
We checked in and were given a room right opposite the ice machine. We knew it would be a problem. Not sure what the fascination is with ice machines here - not like anyone does mini bars anymore. Anyway of course someone was partying all night and kept refilling their ice til 2am - it was so loud we recorded it. Needless to say we asked to switch rooms and they gave us a lovely room overlooking union square. Also the layout of the bathroom was much nicer being away from the bed so more privacy. Very lovely room and comfortable bed. Good amenities and very central to shopping and restaurants. Nice bar for a cocktail. Really enjoyed the rest of our stay. ,6-Jul-18,4
"Would I stay here again? Only if I have business in downtown San Francisco. It is a nice modern hotel with all amenities. However, there are just too many tourists, i.e., chaos. Probably one of the smaller more exclusive houses might be a better place to stay around Union Square.",6-Jul-18,4
"We stayed at this hotel and the hotel Nikko- both in great areas of San FranciscoI thought the Hyatt's room was nice. There was not continental breakfast, which was something hotel Nikko offered- and it was really good.",6-Jul-18,3
Alyssa was excellent who put her heart into our event- she took complete control and put her heart into the event both professionally and personally. Alyssa- you were amazing and wonderful- Thanks Alayssa. ,5-Jul-18,4
"This was our first time in San Francisco. This Hyatt is located in Union Square and is within walking distance to public transportation, shopping, restaurants and the visitor's center. We bought the CIty Pass that included public transportation so access to public transportation was important to us. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful . We used the concierge to help us navigate public transportation and plan our itinerary.They offered great tips. Our room was clean and a nice size. The restaurant was a little pricey so we chose other nearby options. The gym is located on the 35th floor and has great views of the city. We used it daily. We would stay here in the future.",5-Jul-18,5
"Stayed for two nights in this very nice hotel. Excellent located on union square with everything within walking distance. Booked club rooms with lounge access which turned out to be a good choice. Everything what you need for breakfast and snack/light meal during the day:afternoon/evening. Excellent staff in all areas, friendly and service minded with a smile. Would for sure come back.",4-Jul-18,5
Very trusted hotel and pleasant stay for our large family. The rooms were very comfortable and had quality design features. The breakfast was a bit pricey but was included in our package. The kids loved it!,4-Jul-18,5
"First time staying at this Hyatt, GREAT location for 4 nights 5 days. We did not rent a car to sight-see and with this location, all public transportation was very accessible. Our room was big, clean, had tile floors (I wish all hotels would convert to tile floors). Great views, we were placed on the 30th floor. The Grand Club Lounge was a perfect ending to a long sightseeing day a a nice wake-up call each morning. The cleaning service was efficient, when we left to get breakfast, and returned the room was clean and serviced. I used the gym facilities every morning, even the gym had great views along with towels, water, and plenty if disinfecting wipes.I would definitely recommend when staying in San Fransisco!",3-Jul-18,5
"Stayed here for 3 nights. Good location, shops and subway/Bart nearby. Secure lobby, access to elevators is being monitored. I experienced a very fast and courteous check-in procedure, very welcoming and friendly staff, my luggage was brought upstairs in no time. Was very happy with my room nr. 2918 (2 double beds): good size room, clean, very comfortable beds, aircon worked perfectly and also the window could slide open a bit for additional fresh air, fantastic city views, good size bathroom, reasonable room rate (it was in a weekend), very reasonable costs for self parking (""assisted parking"" as opposed to ""valet parking""). Didn't eat in, so can not commend on that. Would stay here again. Highly recommendable, ask for a high floor room. ",2-Jul-18,4
"Stayed here 5 nights recently in an Executive View Suite while visiting family . We had a living room with a sofa, work table, and small fridge and a bedroom with a king bed. Our 2 teenagers slept in day beds (one in the bedroom and the other in the living room). The views of the city were fantastic! The room was modern (electric controls for blinds/lights, motion sensored nightlights under the nightstands, individual climate control in each room), clean, and comfortable. Housekeeping was excellent, and the rest of the staff was very friendly. There is a CVS and a Starbucks right across the street, and the hotel is walking distance to both Powell and Montgomery Stations. We took BART from the airport (30 minute ride) because it was easy lugging our carry-on the few blocks to the hotel, but it might be harder with larger suitcases. There's plenty of great shopping and nice restaurants nearby. Loved the hotel some much that we will be returning for our trip next year.",1-Jul-18,5
"This hotel was one of the more affordable options on our trip to San Francisco and were happy with our stay.PROS: Location (on Stockton Street which is a main thoroughfare in San Francisco, has a Starbucks, close to upscale shopping and a great toy store, and very safe and clean neighborhood)Extremely clean hotelGreat, friendly staffMultiple, quick elevators (it is a large hotel)Food options on siteFree bottled waters daily (a life saver!)Modern and decent sized roomsCONS:Far away from a lot of the more touristy sitesWater pressure in shower was absolutely terribleNot many great dining options within walking distance No pool (would be nice with kids!)But we would definitely stay here again!!",1-Jul-18,5
"The location is great! You have StarBucks across the street, The Apple Store is 30 seconds away.. Macy's, The Cheese Cake Factory, Saks fifth avenue. And more! All are less than 5 minutes away on foot!The staff is friendly, they have a small sports center (I wouldn't call it a gym) on the 37th floor (I think) with an awesome view.However the room service was less exciting.. had to call 3 times within one hour to get a heater...",29-Jun-18,4
"Stayed at this hotel on our way to Hawaii. I had stayed here once before, around ten years ago and decided to come back again but this time with the kids. The hotel has a great location close to stores and restaurants. Would stay here again!!!",28-Jun-18,4
"As others have noted, this is a nice place. The Grand Hyatt checks all the boxes (gym, restaurant, consistent house-keeping, central location) and the front desk staff is efficient. I didnâ€™t rate it as 5 stars though because the hotel lacks charm and could use a few small tweaks. To be specific, most hotels of this level provide bottled water in its rooms or leave a chocolate / nice note on the bed side. The Grand Hyatt is extremely impersonal in this regard. Moreover, the vents in the room and the bathroom need a thorough dusting. They were very dirty, which was in sharp contrast to the actual room (very clean). All in all, Iâ€™d stay here again if I got a good deal on Priceline, etc. ",28-Jun-18,4
"Great location and great hotel right in the middle of Union Square. Highly recommend this place. Just a walking distance from lots of eateries and shopping. Thereâ€™s a Starbucks in the hotel, and another one right opposite the entrance. A CVS convenience store is located 2 mins away, in case you want to pick up sundry items. The rooms are fairly big, comfortable and well equipped. Modern. Clean. Loved the art works in the hotel lobby. The hotel staff is friendly. The concierge desk gets a double thumbs up as they were a great help for us in deciding what we wanted to do around the city and how to get to places. ",27-Jun-18,5
"This is a very large hotel. So expect it to be very busy and hence, you won't feel the personalised service here. Nevertheless, staff are efficient and polite. Location is excellent. Near to Union Square. The rooms have been refurbished a few years back and are still functional and ok, but certainly the wear and tear are showing. Breakfast was average but the staff were all very efficient.",27-Jun-18,3
"If you are looking for a convenient location for tourism or business, this is ideal. I lived in SF for 28 years before moving away, so I had no reason to stay at the Hyatt. The room was decent, however, the location on the other side of the elevator was not good. We could hear a constant wind tunnel whenever the elevator moved. Please make sure you ask for a room that is not in that type of location.",27-Jun-18,4
"We spent 5 nights here and our experience was great. All the staff was all very friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable and clean. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was excellent. The staff in the restaurant were all very friendly and quick to take care of every need we might have. They were constantly watching for any indication that we needed something. Not to the point of being over you all the time, but offered refills for drinks etc. They would ask about your day or where your were from, showing interest in their customers. The host and hostess were also very helpful. We were traveling with our teenage granddaughter, who likes to sleep later than we do, so we would go down for breakfast while she was catching an extra hour of sleep. When she was ready, we would take her down and all the staff were very helpful in getting her a delicious breakfast to take back to our room. I really can't think of a better experience we have had anywhere. I would definitely stay here again. It is located just three blocks from Chinatown. We walked there several times. The streets felt safe when we were out. It is next to Union Station, which is good if you are looking for shopping. The tour buses all stop there, so you are close for pick up if you use a ""hop on hop off"". The concierges were very helpful getting tickets or information. They gave us excellent suggestions for restaurants. The cable cars are one block away. You can ride all the way to the wharf, piers or embarcadero. We used Uber a couple of times and they were very efficient at getting us where we needed to go in a timely manner. All in all it was an excellent experience. You will see some posts about the homeless. There are homeless in San Francisco, but we did not feel threatened by them. They did not stay around the hotel. I read reports from others that they saw them in the hotels and even up on the floors where they were staying. We did not have that problem. Felt very safe the entire time we were there. If you stay away from the Tenderloin area, you should not have any problems. Our room had two queen beds and a partial bay view. It was very nice to look out and see the sailboats on the bay and the twinkling lights at night.",27-Jun-18,5
"Just spent a 3 day break in the city & would recommend this hotel for it's location both for amenities & arriving from the airport with just a short walk from the BART. Handy also for walking distance to the cable car & bus links, Chinatown & down to the Bay area. Will use on a possible return.",27-Jun-18,5
"I decided to stay in this hotel because of the good reviews here, i was little bit disappointed when first got in the room..very average furniture,no toiletries,no bath robe,no slippers,no water boiler, ...nothing at all..!Lobby is very small..Donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll come here again.",26-Jun-18,3
Great friendly service and fast! Room was perfect and so was view. It was quiet and we slept well. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes to shop or dine. The area is filled with high end stores and restaurants. ,26-Jun-18,5
"After a long flight from the UK we got the warmest welcome when we arrived at the Grand Hyatt. Loved our room with amazing views over the Bay. Coffee maker and a fridge in the room were very welcome. As were the bottles of water available from reception. Hotel is well located next to Union Square and a short walk from the metro, cable car turnaround and F line bus for Fisherman's Wharf. Front desk staff and concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. We had no problems with Wi-Fi and there is a facility for printing out boarding passes. Would definitely return.",22-Jun-18,5
"This hotel has all the quality of a grand Hyatt which you expect but what sets this apart is its location at union square, considering the room rates itâ€™s very good value for location and the staff are very efficient We opted for a bay view which was well worth the small extra price as the view we had was spectacular If you are looking for a nice hotel in a great location we would certainly recommend the Grand Hyatt",22-Jun-18,4
"This is one of my favorite Hyatt Hotels, when my family comes I always ask for a high floor overlooking Union Square, & I put them up in the nice big room so they can enjoy the city views and take in San Francisco! This hotel is slightly bigger than me Regency Club, but the Hyatt Regency San Francisco on the Embarcadero is also another excellent choice if you want to stay in a Hyatt property, and be close to tourist spots like the ferry building. The Hyatt Grand is a great hotel, and they have breakfast in the Club level on the 32nd Floor I believe, which has delicious omelettes, sausages & fruits, with an honor bar for your drinks, as well as all of the juice, cereal, oatmeals & milk that one could hope for while staying in a hotel. Great friendly staff who are always very attentive and welcoming! Like most downtown San Francisco hotels, there is no pool or sauna per se but there are nice fitness centers at both the Hyatt Grand and the Hyatt Regency. Consider joining the world of Hyatt rewards program as it certainly provides you with better options during your stay such as free Wi-Fi upgrades and numerous points for every dollar spent at Hyatt properties.",20-Jun-18,4
"Our stays at the Grand Hyatt have always been first class. The staff is extremely helpful. The rooms are distinctive, clean, and very comfortable. The club level dining experience is excellent, especially the breakfast offerings. The location is perfect for shopping in Union Square and I always feel safe there. I can't wait to stay there again.",19-Jun-18,5
Best location ever for a visitor to SF. The service was great. Spenser was very cooperative on check in. Parking is 35$ but it seems this is the norm in SF. Extra taxes were added to the bill !! Other than that it was just peered the stay.,19-Jun-18,4
"Visited 6/14/2018. As usual, service and condition of property was excellent. Wonderful location. Hyatt provides aconsistently satisfying experience. Hyatt points are easy to use and website is user friendly.",18-Jun-18,5
"Stayed for four nights. The room was very spacious, loved the controls on the wall and beside the bed for the lights, blinds etc. The furniture in the lounge section had chips in it and is looking a little worn it just sort of took the room down a little. The bed was very comfortable, two bathrooms which is great for getting ready in the mornings. Shampoo etc topped up and the room cleaned well on a daily basis. The staff down at breakfast each morning were lovely, you know it's like little things like on the 2nd day it was ""Welcome back ladies"" and with the amount of people coming in each day I thought that was nice that we were recognised and greeted warmly. The other staff were attentive and had a great attitude as well. Fabulous location in the city, 5 minute walk to Chinatown. I'd recommend staying here. If I'm back in the city, I will be. There isn't water in the room, but when you're heading out just ask reception and they'll give you some, same when coming back in - too easy. Concierge was also great with maps and directions, taxis were called for us by the doorman when we needed them. Nothing was a hassle and it all just went really smoothly. Our bags were held onto during the day as out flight was at 9pm and there was no issue retrieving them. Thank you for an enjoyable and very comfortable stay.",18-Jun-18,4
"Stayed for two nights during our sixteen night tour of USA. This hotel is nice but definitely our least favorite of all the hotels we stayed at. The lobby and rooms are nice but the bathroom goes back in time with a shower over the bath with a curtain....arggghh my worst nightmare, so gross and un hygienic!!. The soundproofing between rooms was pretty bad and we could hear the toilet flushing above and people chatting early morning next door!!. Breakfast is the poorest I have ever had traveling worldwide for many years. It was so tiny with minimal choice and food at hot buffet was merely warm. The dining room was also really small and cramped. The staff however throughout the hotel were always very helpful and friendly and can not fault them the only exception being house keeping attempting to service our room at 8am on the day we were due to check out at 12noon!!. We had good views from our room if the bay in the distance and the location of the hotel is great right at Union square. I wouldnâ€™t return to this hotel again though, there are many options nearby that I feel would offer better value and amenities and no shower curtain!!!!",14-Jun-18,3
"Long flight in from Japan and had a 12 hr. lay-over. Last minute booked on Hyatt App, fast and efficient. Hopped Shuttle and was checked in and sleeping with an hour.Great locations and good for that pre and post stays to traveling.",14-Jun-18,4
"I have reviewed this hotel before and rated it poorly due to the wind effects on the building [sway and noise]. I recently stayed again on a lower floor [3rd] and would give this property a much better review. Location is terrific, staff are friendly, great amenities including a good fitness center, and rooms are spacious. I would definitely recommend it but stay at the lower levels. You can enjoy a great view from the fitness center or meetings rooms on the top floor.",13-Jun-18,4
I was given a handicap room with a very non functional bathroom. The bath towels were hanging on the Support bars around the toilet. I was given another room the following day and the tiloilet stoped working. Overall not a very good experience. The management addressed our concerns begrudgingly and not in conciliatory tone. ,13-Jun-18,3
"I stayed in this hotel for a week while traveling on business. I had a room on the 11th floor overlooking Union Square.Firstly, the location and the view are perfect. Very central, right next to loads of tourist attractions and also travel links if, like me, you are on business. Staff were generally really helpful and friendly, I had to contact them about a few different things and always sorted my problems.The gym is on one of the higher floors, great view and relatively well equipped. Its fairly small but it was empty every time I went in so that wasn't an issue. Food is what let this hotel down for me. Badly.On my first night I ordered some room service and this made me violently ill foe the next 2 days. Very very bad as it meant I had to rearrange planned meetings I had. Later on in the week I went to the restaurant for breakfast. The layout is very cramped and the seating very uncomfortable. It was $34 for the smallest buffet I've ever seen, looked very sad and unappealing. Overall, I'd definitely stay here again but the food needs massive improvement.",12-Jun-18,4
"used to stay here regularly, but stopped many years ago, as the great location could not compensate for the very worn room conditions and the generally unappealing public areas. am pleased to say hyatt has done a lot, and this is a fine property now. room was sleek and modern, but still felt confortable and not stark. bed was very good. water pressure was good. had a small frig that we did not use. plenty of elevators, too. a big deal in a high rise. the public areas are very nice, lobby fireplace, and mezzanine bar and restaurant. great location, would reccomend",11-Jun-18,4
Recently stayed here. Nice and close to Union Square and China Town etc. Staff very friendly and helpful. We found the food a bit over priced and average to be honest. Number of homeless/ beggars around the hotel - mainly across the road. Close to a Starbucks. ,11-Jun-18,4
Customer service was excellent the entire stay. Upgraded to a room with a view of Union Square but curtains malfunctioned so we weren't able to enjoy the view. Contacted the concierge and maintenance fixed it right away. A few hours later the curtains were not working again. Didn't have time to contact concierge again.,11-Jun-18,4
"This was a 5 day stay to complete our recent East to West Coast trip of America from the UK. After not having a very good experience staying at the Grand Hyatt New York at the start of our holiday we were a little worried that the end of the holiday would be spoilt. No worry there, from the moment our car door was opened we knew this was how it was meant to be and what we are used to.Kimberley on reception was wonderful and checked us in quickly and efficiently, with water bottles handed to us as soon as we got to the desk. A bellboy escorted us and our luggage to our spacious room and showed us how everything worked (we knew but it was nice to receive the extra attention).Our room on the 30th floor was large, clean and spacious with a wonderful view across the city and to the bay beyond. The bathroom was smaller than expected with the size of the room but still had a good walk in shower so no issues at all.The Grand Club Lounge( 32nd Floor) was very good with a good choice of horâ€™doevres in the evening and a reasonable choice for breakfast. Staff members in the lounge were helpful, friendly and obviously enjoyed their job, especially David and Jimmy (we miss you!). The view from the Grand Club lounge looks over the city and â€œThe Rockâ€ù which is Alcatraz, and was a lovely place to wile away a few relaxing hours at any time of the day.Hailey the Concierge did an excellent job for us arranging a limo to take us on a city tour, and was very enthusiastic to hear how it all went. She also assisted in changing our collection time for a pre booked car to take us to the airport for our return home; nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Each concierge we came into contact with was just as nice and helpful. We even had one of the house keepers and a maintenance man ask us if everything was alright and how were we enjoying our holiday. After our wonderful city tour we had a very pleasant couple of vodka martinis in the OneUp Lounge, thanks Zak and Mitch, again two great members of staff.This was the perfect finish to our wonderful holiday, and even on check out Ira again proved that the Grand Hyatt San Francisco has some wonderful staff members. We have travelled around Canada many times including Vancouver where we stay at the Fairmont Waterfront on their Gold Floor, and we love the place, San Francisco and the Grand Hyatt is now our second love. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this wonderful hotel and must go back.",8-Jun-18,5
"Lovely room, great views, really lovely skyline from the 26th floor overlooking Alcatraz in the background. Pillows were uncomfortable and its another one of those hotels that favours a sliding bathroom door that doesn't seal, which is my least favorite kind if you'd like to pee with dignity. Short of that, a very lovely hotel, great location next to Union Square, lots of very expensive shops around and only a short taxi ride to Pier 39. Recommend Fog Harbour Fish House, very nice food but book with ample notice!",7-Jun-18,4
This hotel has a good location and excellent facillites Nice and clean and well servicedMy son and I stayed there for 3 days in may 2018The concierge was very helpful with showing us how to get around,6-Jun-18,4
Our stay at the hotel was a great experience the staff was professional and accommodating .I would strongly recommend this hotel to both couples or family.Comfortable rooms good food and close by to the major city attractions.,6-Jun-18,5
"Stayed for 8 days while attending a conference and visiting my daughter. Every aspect of this hotel was excellent. We order room service twice. Both times the food was delivered promptly, it was hot, and of excellent quality. Housekeeping services were excellent. We had drinks in the bar several times and found them to be attentive and friendly. Even the doorman was very accommodating. All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised by the service and professionalism of everyone we dealt with.",4-Jun-18,5
"We stayed here for a business meeting. The location just off Union Square. Chinatown is a few short blocks away and much is within walking distance, including the Moscone Center. There are numerous excellent restaurants close by and many high end shopping venues. The prices are definitely above what is reasonable for the rooms which are cramped and older. The elevators are a bit slow and the fitness area is rudimentary. The persons working there are tops. They are, to a person, friendly, helpful, and courteous. Other than the price, this was a good hotel.",3-Jun-18,4
"Ideal location beside Union Square where the HOHO Bus begins. A block from the iconic cable car that goes to Fishermanâ€™s Wharf area, GreyLine Bus Tours, and couple more in different directions to shopping, restaurants and China Town. Our room was spacious, very clean, and had an excellent mattress. The staff were courteous and professional. Overall, a well managed hotel.",2-Jun-18,5
"We had a pleasant and early checkin.. we were given water which was complementary anytime.. the room was decent size with an amazing room, it was quiet although close to the elevators, the porters were courteous and helpful, the room had excellent view of the San Francisco skyline, the hotel location is amazing, itâ€™s well connected, and there are loads of restaurants and food options available around from street style to fine dining.. shopping malls and designer brands were all walking distance ",2-Jun-18,5
"This hotel and staff were outstanding. I particularly want to recognize the concierge desk: Elaine, Vanessa, Liz, Hailey and Joanne. They know their business and were extremely helpful in their recommendations. They were professional and friendly. Also, Tan and Jaime in the bar were fantastic....extremely welcoming and kind. Finally, Mac, the gentleman who has worked for the Hyatt for 50 years. He was very warm and friendly in his greetings in the lobby. All in all, rooms were comfortable and the experience was terrific.",1-Jun-18,5
"This hotel is in the middle of Union Square. Centrally located within walking distance of China Town and the Financial District. The service staff here is excellent and tries to cater to your every whim. Be sure to connect with Vanessa at the concierge desk, she was most helpful.",31-May-18,5
"The hotel is very well located. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. We had a great view from our room. The staff were courteous and helpful. Considering how big the hotel is, you did not have to wait long for the elevators.",31-May-18,4
"Convenient location in Union Square, next to Chinatown. Really enjoyed the restaurant/bar - the bartender there was so delightful. Always am pleased with the Grand Hyatt brand. Would highly recommend.",31-May-18,5

I really enjoyed my stay here. San Fran is a very expensive place to stay and it was 200 bucks a night which was meant to be reasonable. But price aside I really liked the hotel. The bed was super comfortable I shared with a mate but it was so big it did not feel like sharing a bed. The coffee machine was a good touch and being on the 34 floor the views weâ€™re phenomenal. I found the staff helpful and it was really peaceful after a busy day exploring. I donâ€™t normally stay in big hotels as am more of a small guest house man but I really enjoyed the change. It was nice to spoil myself. ,30-May-18,5
"I had the room on the 30th floor . The views were good, room was clean, mattress comfortable. Charging plug points bedside, remote control to open / close the shades, coffee maker in the room. Stay was just perfect. Location wise - close to Union square, most designer stores. ",29-May-18,5
"The property is conveniently and centrally located next to Union Square and the cable car lines. Within a 1/2 mile radius, one can shop and eat until you drop. The staff is friendly and accommodating.",29-May-18,5
Hotel is well located with great view from higher floors. Very good quality food and room service. Shower could be better and rooms lack mini bars. Refrigerators are empty. No water in rooms which is most surprising.,29-May-18,4
"We always stay at Hyatt Hotels if they are available. We travel a lot and understand that each Hyatt experience will be different. There is a certain level of professionalism that you expect when staying at a Grand Hyatt. I REALLY dislike the check in process. Why they decided to get rid of a traditional ""hotel front desk"" is beyond me. No one knows where to stand to wait their turn, the kiosk style check in makes the lobby look like a mess. The computer screen blocks the view of the desk clerk (I can't even tell you what my guy looked like. He didn't introduce himself, we weren't offered water, he was VERY uninterested in checking us in). It was a big disappointment. The concierge staff were wonderful. That is why I still gave them 4 stars, instead of 3, but any interaction with front desk personnel was lack luster to say the least.",29-May-18,4
You never miss with Hyatt. Always dependable and takes the worry out of business travel so you can concentrate on why your really there. Great hotel in a great city. Really enjoyed myself. My second time in San Fran. I hope to return again someday,28-May-18,5
"I was visiting for a long weekend and found the hotel a great choice. Itâ€™s an easy walk to BART, Union Square and SFMOMA. Wonderfully comfortable bed and very roomy space. Iâ€™d definitely stay there again.",27-May-18,5
"Property location and rooms are absolutely great, especially if you're coming for a shopping or sightseeing trip. The historic San Francisco tram line is right on the adjacent street. The staff can do with a little more training.",27-May-18,4
"A great location next to Union Square; close to BART, restaurants, grocery stores, Chinatown, cable cars. My view room had spectacular view overlooking Union Square and also the cityscape, surrounding hills, and the bay beyond.",27-May-18,5
"Like many hotels, this one that claims to care about sustainability and conserving water by allowing the guest indicate when they want towels to be replaced. However, despite all of my efforts to clearly indicate I wanted my towels not replaced by hanging them up, they were replaced anyway.",26-May-18,1
"My partner and I recently stayed here for 11 nights, on first impressions it is quite a grand hotel and definitely suits it's name sake.We were greeted on arrival by the doorman who offered to assist with our cases, check in was smooth and stress free.We took the lift to our room which was like a rollercoaster ride as the lift was so swift and fast.Our room was really quite nice, lovely big and comfortable bed, which is always a concern for me as having a congenital back condition I worry about the comfort of the bed, I didn't need to worry as it was divine.The room size was more than ample, overlooking the city.There was plenty of drawer and wardrobe space with a lovely big bathroom.What I did find bizarre was the electronic window blinds would randomly open at various times in the night. I should have reported this but I forgot and to be honest I thought it was funny and wasn't an issue for us really. Room service is excellent and very swift, the staff who ensure your room is clean and tidy do an excellent job and are lovely and friendly.Every time we got into the lift with a member of staff they always asked we were and how is a room and did we need anything, nothing was too much trouble. We frequented the bar for drinks and a small bite to eat, the food is lovely and so are the cocktails. What impressed me the most is the way the staff helped us when we were met with an unexpected predicament while on the city tram. Just to be cautious as a tourist do not take your eye off your handbag for a second as there are pickpockets on the trams.Liz on the concierge desk immediately sprung into action for us by contacting the local police and arranged for them to be brought up to our room.We would like to thank Liz, Stephen and Jason for their attentive care towards us, despite what happened it would not put us off visiting again as it could have easily happened anywhere. This is an exceptional hotel and you will not be disappointed with your stay here.We are looking forward to coming back again very soon.",25-May-18,5
"A Grand Hyatt in name only. While its location is great, and it serves the corporate/function market very well, this is a poor choice for holiday travel - and we had 9 nights there.The guest room (KIng) we had was high up on the 29th floor overlooking Union Square as per our booking. We were paying extra for that ",23-May-18,3
Easy walking distance to Moscone Center and located right in the shopping district. close to Chinatown as well. Enough noise got through the windows even at level 10. Rooms are updated and good sized. Would stay again,22-May-18,4
"My hotel stay was punctuated by my realization that I had left my jewelry in the room safe several hours after I had departed. My call to the hotel was met with such incredible professionalism. The Security staff had not only located my jewelry, but had inventoried the items and placed them in the hotel security safe. This morning, I was greeted by the Hotel security staff where I was able to retrieve my jewelry. Everything was exactly where I had left it, not an item was missing. I will be sure to return and when I do, I know the security of me and my personal items are at the forefront of their hospitality. ",21-May-18,5
"The Grand Hyatt is located next to Union Square and is thus a great place to start exploring the city. Check-in was a good customer experience, and overall, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are big enough, well-equipped and comfortable, and if youâ€™re lucky, offer nice views on the city skyline. Breakfast is not included in the price, which makes a stay at the Grand Hyatt not exactly cheap. Breakfast is good though, and so are the bar on the mezzanine level and the other amenities. The only negative is the internet: I stay in a lot of great hotels and too often I find the internet to be very spotty and faulty. The Grand Hyatt is no exception which is rather frustrating when on business travel. ",19-May-18,4
"I did not appreciate being placed into a room that was next to the service elevator shaft. Bad move, i will not be returning here again. Felt like i was sleeping next to a subway. Hotel location good but Room was shabby and tired. ",19-May-18,2
"Grand Hyatt offers the best location for travelers who want access to the shopping district, Embarcadero, Fishermanâ€™s Wharf, Chinatown, and North Beach. It is also closer to laundromat services (Peteâ€™s Laundry is the best!). We have stayed in Parc 55 in 2017, which was also a good hotel, but we much prefer the location of Grand Hyatt.Service-wise, I would give them a 4.5 rating. Most staff are cordial and helpful. Some are cold and rude.",14-May-18,5
Room expensive with no added value vs a normal hotel.Premium price not corresponding to any differentiating service$450/night not including breakfastNo amenities in roomPersonnel not friendlyI won't choose again this hotelComparable to any 3-4 less expensive hotels,14-May-18,2
"Central to the Financial District or on the Cable Car line for pleasure, this hotel is just the right fit. Incredible staff available at all hours of the day to help with questions, directions or even suggestions on food. One of my top Hyatt hotels in the world",14-May-18,5
"We stayed 4 nights in a Grand Club King. Check-in was very friendly & welcoming.Comfy bed & pillows and good shower. However, air-conditioning duct was continually noisy even with a/con switched off.",13-May-18,3
"My husband and I stayed 2 days in a regular King Room (#1511) to attend a conference. The room was very clean, comfy, with newer furniture. On Friday (5/10/18), we were able to watch filming from an adjacent roof top. Pretty cool. The homemade bbq potato chips served at the bar were unique and a real treat. Also, ordered room service which was delicious. Staff were very courteous and helpful. Upon arrival, I really appreciated the quick response from valet staff. Yes, itâ€™s costly, but we didnâ€™t want to deal with self parking across the street. The conference was held at the lowest level and staff were very professional. There was some side talking from the servers during the breakfast presentation, but I believe it was because attendees were arriving late and the servers were try to serve them. I would definitely attend a conference here again and will stay overnight. Very safe location and lots to see.",12-May-18,5
"Guest room: excellent condition, overall hotel: excellent. I am less likely to recommend Hyatt hotels in general due to problems with Wi-Fi connectivity. Once connected, the service keeps dropping every few minutes and one has to keep going through the log-in process. Frustrating to say the least. Hotel staff were very helpful and connected us with Hyatt IT in San Diego to attempt to solve the issue. Long story but finally unresolved issue and IT person said it is a problem with Apple devices. Uh, hello Hyatt corporate; most travelers are using Apple products these days and connectivity is paramount. The problem lies with the internet service provider that Hyatt corporate has chosen. Same problem in Indian Wells, Sacramento, and Hyatt hotels in general. Also discussed with other hotel guests using Apple, same issue of constant dropping out of service connection so not just my device. Your competitor hotels do not have this issue. To the Board of Directors: Do not let Hyatt go the way of Wells Fargo. I like Hyatt hotels.",11-May-18,4
"Great location in Union Square. Check-in was smooth, lobby and reception were well staffed. My room was on the 21st floor, simple design but cozy and warm. No lounge chair, but not a big deal. The cleaning crew was great, but the overall room service could be improved. Few calls to housekeeping were not picked up, bathrobe and sleepers are available only upon request and it took 20 minutes and a follow-up call to have them delivered. It was a bit annoying waiting to take a shower after a day of business meetings. Dry cleaning was delivered late and again after a follow-up call. I could not enjoy the rooftop because that day it was closed for a private event. To be fair, this hotel is 4-star, so not comparable with the 5-stars Grand Hyatt in Asia,but the overall experience was positive if compared to other San Francisco hotels.",10-May-18,3
"The actual STAY at grand Hyatt was good. Comfortable bed with minimum noise, nice view. However Communication between staff and customer service NEED A LOT OF WORK. The night before our check in I called at 8:45 p.m. To make sure that checking in early Friday morning would not be an issue as we would be arriving around 4 or 5:00 a.m. Gentleman confirmed and thanked me for calling to let him know to get the room ready. We arrived approximately 5:45 a.m. the next day and was told that our room was not ready, Even though a note was placed on the record. We had to wait over 6 HOURS for the room. Tried to get some rest on the couches in there Lobby lounge area, in which we were approached by staff two separate times to ask us if we were guests of the hotel, as to suggest that we were loitering in the Lobby. Mind you, there were people that had been in the lobby longer then we had been, and they WERE NOT ASKED ANYTHING. After checking with the staff at the front counter the person returned apologetically stating that our room is continuing to be readied. After the first time we were approached, I asked if there was a simple standard room we could get some rest in while we waited for our Bay View room to be ready. They were not able to accommodate stating that I would be stuck with the (standard) room for the length of my stay. Eventually, once we were notified that our room was ready, the clerk stated that she had placed me in a â€œnicer roomâ€ù. Come to find out it was the same room I had paid for in the first place. One thing I will say is Gliezl, a front counter attendant did make Sure we had water and was able to comp. Our breakfast for the day, which they almost charge me twice for once at breakfast and once at check out. So all in all, the biggest issues we experienced where lack of communication and poor customer service. Definitely not what I would expected from a reputable Union square hotel.",8-May-18,2
"The location of the Grand Hyatt is pefect, directly at Union Square. It takes 30min walking to Fishermans Wharf and within 10-15min you find everything for shopping, lunch or dinner.The rooms were clean and everything you need was there.",8-May-18,5
"We loved just about everything about this hotel! The location was great right in Union Square, so it was close to everything. Parking was very easy in a garage right across the street. The room was clean and the layout was easy to navigate. Beds were very comfortable, too! The hotel restaurant, One Up, had excellent tomato soup, though it was a bit pricey (but expected given the location). The only issue we had was that we stayed in a joined room next to a family we didn't know, and we could hear their conversations and kids very easily through the closed joined door. Otherwise, absolutely no complaints! Highly recommend!",6-May-18,5
"The hotel was perfect. Great location, great service and staff. Highly recommend staying here for business or pleasure. Upgraded without asking. Room with a view. Enjoyed the restaurant and bar. Safe and secure.",6-May-18,5
"Stayed in this hotel on a recent vacation. Fantastic location in Union Square, close to shopping, transportation and dining. The staff was accommodating and friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. ",5-May-18,4
"Room was quite nice but not amazing. We had a club floor room. Room was no different to ordinary rooms but you get access to the club lounge on floor 32. This means you get free food EG breakfast and dinner. Don't pay for bed and breakfast, go for the club room, you get a great breakfast included, bacon, eggs, sausage, fruit, cereal, smoked salmon, bagels etc etc. Food in the evening between 5 and 7, choices during our week included chicken, beef, mousakka, Mexican dishes etc, and lots of other stuff. We only bought our lunches during the week we stayed as we were out sightseeing each day. Great value. Drinks are basically free too. Beers, spirits, wine etc. You're supposed to fill in a card for what drinks you have and then they charge 3 dollars per drink but nobody did this! So great value all told! ",4-May-18,4
The best thing about this hotel is the location near Union Square. Also it is modern and comfortable. The room was nice but lighting strange and hard to use. The restaurant is very basic. The lounge is nice. At $500 a night it was expensive.,4-May-18,3
"We were charged extra for an upgrade the moment we came in. I thought maybe we get a better room for that. But were given a corner room, while the view was ok but the noise in the room next door wont let u rest. The rooms are small in size and really it doesnâ€™t have the class of a grand hyatt i have stayed world over. A bad experience and would strongly not recommend this hotel. Not for the price and the extra paid by us ",4-May-18,1
Basic room not as nice as anticipated.Noise from dart all night like a whoosing noise. Made to feel inferior to more expensive rooms. Good service from people on the hotel door though.Wouldn't visit again.,4-May-18,3
Hotel was immaculate but the staff makes this place the outstanding hotel that it is. Everyone goes the extra mile. It exceeded all of my expectations. Rooms not overly large but adequate. Amenities nice. Food delicious!,3-May-18,5
"The hotel is beautiful! Staff is great and makes you feel welcome from the first time you check-in and throughout your stay. Great location to Union Square, Starbucks is right across the street which is very nice :-)",3-May-18,5
"Great location looking over Union Square with shopping, dining and transportation nearby. View over the square was fun and other side had bay views. Room was not large but was efficient and clean. Staff were personable and extremely helpful",2-May-18,4
"Business meeting in SF and stayed at Grand Hyatt SF. Excellent location. Condition of hotel showed its age or it needs some updates. Atrium is small and staff level is low relative to the number of guests. As a Hyatt member, room preference was not honored. Staff seems hurried. AC unit was loud and temperature not stabled. Room with a connecting door, which was bent and leaked next door's conversation into ours.",1-May-18,3
"Iâ€™ve never had a bad experience at a Grand Hyatt, and this property didnâ€™t disappoint. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and all areas of the hotel I was in were clean and tastefully updated. The location is great: Starbucks and CVS across the street, numerous bars and restaurants in walking distance, plenty of shopping nearby, a few blocks from Moscone, and just a few blocks from Chinatown. If you want to explore San Francisco by cable car, that too is just 2 blocks away! If being in an area thatâ€™s walkable is important to you, and thatâ€™s always a huge thing for me, this is a great location. An added bonus is they have complimentary bottles of water at registration. The only downside Iâ€™d say about the room itself is that thereâ€™s no full length mirror. One of the walls has what looks like the designer tried to use as a full length mirror, but the bottom is only a few inches wide so definitely does not constitute a full length mirror. (You can kind of see this area in the photo with my suitcase) Might seem minor but knowing this hotel has so many business guests due to the close proximity to Moscone, seems like a miss to me. Other than that, the room was great, and I would definitely stay here again. ",29-Apr-18,5
"The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are small but clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. It was nice to have a small refrigerator in the room with the coffee maker. It is very conveniently located and walking distance to the Union Square attractions and great restaurants, cable cars, bus, etc. We took Uber around and the prices were very reasonable. The best part was having Starbucks and a CVS right across the street. We have stayed here before and will return again!",29-Apr-18,4
"I stayed here for 6 nights with my husband and 2 children in April. We really enjoyed our stay. Here are some highlights: Location -great location - unlike many hotels which advertise being on Union Square but are several blocks away, this one is separated from union square only be the Apple store. Itâ€™s in the heart of the shopping district and also close to Chinatown.The room - we had booked a 1 bedroom VIP suite. This room was large and very well appointed. It has a large lounge and dining area and a separate large bedroom with huge ensuite bathroom. There was also a separate toilet off the living area. We had 2 rollaway beds for the kids and there was ample room for the 4 of us. We really liked our room. The only downside was we could hear the elevators going up and down all night. It was quite a loud noise which was disappointing for the amount we paid. (We were in room 3411). The service - excellent service. We had a friendly and efficient check in. We arrived before check in time but they put a rush on housekeeping for the room for us so that we could the room as soon as possible and contacted us when it was ready. The concierge was excellent. Everyone we spoke to was very helpful. When we first arrived we spoke to Joanna and she gave us maos if the area, a list of recommended restaurants and a suggested walking tour route. We saw some things we would not otherwise have seem. Thanks Joanna and Team! This is an expensive hotel but we found the room, location and service all excellent and Iâ€™d definitely stay there again",28-Apr-18,5
Warm welcome and pay attention to details concierge informations were very specific and helpful. Room cleaning service was outstanding Only one thing that could be improve is number of homeless around the hotel. ,27-Apr-18,5
After my experience at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco this is now the only hotel I want to stay at in the future. I was amazed how the staff went above and beyond my expectations and how staying there felt like home.,27-Apr-18,5
Stayed here for 5 nights while attending a wedding. My room was super clean and quiet (on one of the corners where there are only two rooms; not all rooms may be this quiet). Location was great - a quick walk to the Powell BART station. ,26-Apr-18,5
"Overall I was very pleased with the hotel. The hotel staff was outstanding! The concierge desk did an incredible job of recommending restaurants and personal services. And the technician who came up to repair my TV, Willfredo, was great! Very polite, attentive and accommodating. The hotelâ€™s location at Union Square is desirable and convenient, but as in any major city, you have to be keenly aware not to stray into adjacent sketchy areas. The bed was a little too firm for my taste; Iâ€™m sure choosing a mattress firmness is one of the biggest difficulties for a hotel. No question, I would definitely choose to stay at the Grand Hyatt Union Square again!",26-Apr-18,5
"I picked this hotel because of its reasonable rates and seemed like one of the newer places in Union Square. However those who are used to Grand Hyatt standards in Asia should know from the start that this is not on the same level - something that is reflected in the room rates - and is more of a business hotel.It started well. I was warmly welcomed on check-in and was given a room and a free bottle of water despite arriving at 1pm (check-in time was 4pm!).Like most hotels in Union Square, the hotel was not that new but it was very conveniently located near Union Square - and the Apple shop. The room and bathroom were reasonably large. The sheets and towels were all greying, making the room feel a little jaded. More horrifyingly, late in the night I discovered a brown stain which looked like diluted blood on my duvet cover and one of the pillow cases. Not only that, I also found a small shard of hard ragged plastic under the duvet on top of my sheets!Too tired to deal with it that late, I went to the front desk the next morning to ask that all the sheets and pillow cases be changed. I was assured by the front desk staff that it would be taken care of. I go out and return 3 hours later to find that nobody had come to make up my room, much less changed the offending sheets.When I went back to the front desk to ask, I was told that they had made a mistake and changed the sheets in the wrong room! They offered to either change all the bedding or let me change rooms and gave me two drink vouchers to use while I waited. The matter was quickly resolved after that, with the head of housekeeping calling personally to apologise and to offer to waive my nightâ€™s rates. I had also asked for laundry to be picked up in the morning and had to wait for almost 30 mins. When I called after 20 mins to ask when they would be coming by, the person on the phone defensively said with a raised voice: â€œHe has 25 orders to pick up this morning! I didnâ€™t forget!!â€ù I donâ€™t really think the staffâ€™s workload is something the guests should be worrying about when they come stay at your hotel. I also needed to get a data SIM card and asked the (unfriendly, and ultimately not very useful) concierge where I could get one. She told me to go to the Apple store, or the pharmacies which didnâ€™t really make sense to me - of course none of them sold SIM cards. Eventually I walked four blocks and finally found a T-Mobile shop on my own.The rest of my 4-night stay went fine. I appreciated Kinga dealing with the matter decisively and the personal note I received from the housekeeping manager after my stay. ",24-Apr-18,4
"Just finished up a weeklong stay here. I liked the view from my room and the selection of food each morning in the grand club. The fitness center was adequate and not too crowded in the evening. Aside from that, there isnâ€™t much else to rave about. First impression was lackluster. At check-in, I didnâ€™t get a thanks for being a Hyatt elite, just the room key. Despite being an Explorist, I wasnâ€™t offered a room upgrade, but there were two higher categories of room (below suite) showing available on my Hyatt app. I also had added a club access award to the reservation but there was no mention made at check-in of where the club room was located or that the award was active. The room was mostly clean and the bed comfy. Unfortunately, the automatic shades were broken or defective, as the motor would lower the shades well past the window such that the shade started piling up on the floor. Also, the June Jacobs amenities are terrible...I wish Grand Hyatts would upgrade from these products. I probably wouldnâ€™t return here for business again since the price was equivalent to staying in a 5 star resort, but the property didnâ€™t really offer much more than a good location off of Union Square. ",23-Apr-18,3
"This was my first time ever visiting the Grand Hyatt, I was greeted with a friendly smile, valet person told me to make sure and get my ticket validated otherwise my charge would be extremely expensive. My meeting took place on the very top floor, direction was a bit difficult but managed to get to the top. The food and beverage selection for breakfast was excellent, fresh and savory, with service staff that filled my coffee and juice, bacon was crispy and flavorful, an array of danish and croissants, breads with hot and cold options. The meeting room was again complimented with incredible views of San Francisco, provided Herman Miller chairs for the meeting which was incredible and the PM snack as well displayed with a variety of options. Excellent job to the banquet team and the culinary skills. ",22-Apr-18,5
"My boyfriend and I stayed here the day after Christmas. We were upgraded for $25.00 to the 17th floor? With a view of union square. Absolutely worth it!! The women at check in was so friendly, I wish I got her name. Room clean and comfortable as always.",19-Apr-18,5
"I am a mature business woman who travels frequently. Due to the airport being closed, I checked in at 2:00 am. There was no on-site parking. When I parked in front of the hotel for a few minutes to try to determine where the parking is, I was intimidated by aggressive street people. As I was surveying the reception main door area, it had no signage as to where to park, no after-hours telephone number to call either the front desk or the valet. After trying to call the hotel, and, getting lost in a web of ""dial this number for this, or that"", i finally put may car in the no-park zone and ran into the reception desk (again with street people lurking and being assertive. I was very scared!. After speaking to the front desk, I was told that there is off-site parking and the address. Duh, I am visiting from out of town, and, I had no idea where that address is. After I asked the receptionist about a safer alternative as I felt truly unsafe, I was told that there was valet service. After I pried that tidbit out off the front desk clerk, a young man came running through the streets to take my car. Again, no name tag or identification--I went back into the hotel to acknowledge that this is indeed a representative of the hotel, and, I was giving my car to a responsible source. I did speak to the manager on duty on Friday--not sure that she ""got"" it. I mentioned that they should consider some signage for after hours--her response ""we don't have a sign"". I reminded her that there are places who can make a ""sign"". It should be noted that I am from a big city on the East Coast, and, I travel to other large cities, who have their share of homeless. However, I see security everywhere in the form of hotel employees or police at those other cities and I have NEVER felt as unsafe and unsure. Two positives--Randy and the valet service and Elaine at the Concierge desk. All else aside, the next time I will stay outside of the city at a Hyatt House or similar. They generally feature people who are warm and caring, parking and much nicer rooms. Really, Hyatt? This is upscale? Really?",14-Apr-18,2
"Great location and lovely hotel. Convenient to assess to main attractions like union square, market street, cable car, Chinatown. Room has great view over the Bay and make sure you get a room at 20 something floors to get a beautiful view. Go to 36 floors to see a better view of the costume and Bay. Room is clean except no daily water is provided. The level 2 lounge is great with reasonable price and choices of wine. The Starbucks is just right opposite of you are a Starbucks drinker.. ",14-Apr-18,4
"Location wise it is very good and located in Union Square where all all the shopping is nearby. Room size is a bit small but the room is very new. Tastefully furbished. Bed is comfortable as well. The bathroom is very small but it is very clean and functional. Overall, no complain here and would come back here again.",14-Apr-18,4
"Everything was a bit pricey for this hotel. The room was pretty small and valet parking was more expensive than other hotels. The room was updated and clean, with a decent view of the city. The restaurant in the hotel was really expensive too.",12-Apr-18,3
"I am an active and loyal Hyatt customer and am disappointed with my current visit to this Grand Hyatt location. While the hotel is well situated and nicely appointed I feel some strange choices have been made that detract from the experience. First, the coffee machine in the room is the cheapest type (akin to what a motel 8 would have) and no morning coffee service is available in the lobby; unless you choose to pay for coffee at their cafe. At a four star hotel you should be able to get a basic cup of coffee without an extra expense. Second, they have a sign in the room that they only change the towels and sheets every other day unless you specifically call the operator and request this. I would not mind this if they contributed at least part of the savings to a conservation group. But instead the pocket the savings; put the onus on the customer to request service and serve it up as a commitment to the environment. Thus, still a quality hotel but the service/amenities could be more customer friendly. ",12-Apr-18,3
"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights over spring break. The room rate was a bit expensive. However, the room was lovely. We ordered room service on one night which was excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. However, the room was noisy at night so I couldn't say that I had an great nights sleep. The hotel did have a sign in reception advising that due to the weather at the time that this could occur. Hotel is a good central location for visiting the city.",11-Apr-18,4
"Amazing location in the heart of San Francisco. Well-kept, modern hotel with all the things one would expect from a Hyatt. Excellent service, tourist recommendations were made thoughtfully and with insight. Well done.",10-Apr-18,5
"I read the reviews of all the hotels in Union Square before selecting one. I wanted a nice stay in great hotel for my friends-weekend in San Francisco. The Grand Hyatt was perfect. The lobby and check in process is well managed, friendly and attentive and perfect Hyatt service! The food in the restaurant is very good, I ate breakfast there each day with my friends. Also used the bar once and the service and quality offered is excellent. The best part are the great rooms--I was in 3007 and had the most perfect bay view including Telegraph Hill, Alcatraz and the Transamerica building--and despite some monsoon weather the other day it was still spectacular. The king bed was comfortable and firm, there room had wood floors and excellent lighting and electronics-plenty of places to plug in all your technology or stream to the TV all your subscriptions if you wanted to. Housekeeping was friendly and attentive, great water pressure, modern huge bathrooms and dressing area. Also visited friends' room and their Union Square view also had a water view as well. So perfect. Next time I will try and get two adjoining rooms and bring my kids. The automatic blackout curtain really does let you wake up with a big flourish. I loved the trip. ",9-Apr-18,5
"This hotel has a good location..near to many things and the bus stop is across the street. The hotel is kept well, staff is friendly and accommodating. Rooms were nice, short on drawer space, but very modern and updated.",7-Apr-18,5
"Booked an executive suite for our recent San Francisco stay. The hotel location in Union Square is great and the view from our 23rd floor windows was also awesome! The staff is very efficient, polite and extremely helpful. The suite was very roomy, with many electronic upgrades (motorized shades, etc). There were also two full bathrooms. Suite was very clean but there were some signs of wear. My only issue with the room was that it is advertised as sleeping three, which I assumed was 2 on the bedroom king size bed and one in the living room (on what I assumed would be a sleep sofa). The sofa is not a sleeper, which only left the one bed. On the plus side, management supplied a rollaway bed at no charge. Still seems a bit weird that this huge suite with 2 bathrooms only had the one bed... I would recommend this hotel, for the location and view alone..",6-Apr-18,4
"After 3 days in Palo Alto .. and before 3 days in Napa, me and the family staying in SF. The checkin is quick and easy. The service superb and friendly. The in house , called One Up I think , is adequate without being too great. The most disappointing thing was the room. There was nothing Grand about it. This should just be called The Hyatt. Or the regular Hyatt..It was once again adequate, like a business hotel. Plain and efficient. Few toiletries. Zero luxury. Also the valet parking was expensive. In my view.. I'm not a local so not sure on comparisons. But it was close to 70 usd per day. Gym was small too but had 4-5 new running machines which was nice. Location great for food, museums and china town. Probably wouldn't stay here again ",6-Apr-18,3
"I stayed here a couple of years back and wasnâ€™t impressed with this hotel. It looked tired. But late last year I started staying here again and have come back a lot more often. They did a really good job with the renovation. Iâ€™m a globalist and so have access to the lounge. Pretty good food at night and varies every day. The best part is the $3 honor bar. Wine, beer or mixed drinks for $3. Canâ€™t beat that. The only complaint I have is breakfast. Itâ€™s the same items every single day. Yes EVERY day. I feel like weâ€™re being discourage to come back lol. But overall I highly recommend this hotel. Great location, rooms with really nice views and is next to lots and lots of high end stores and close to Chinatown. And itâ€™s next to the new Apple store.",5-Apr-18,5
"I was in San Francisco for a meeting at the Palace (a very storied, grand old hotel) and moved to the Grand Hyatt for the weekend. The contrast between the two could not be more pronounced. The Grand Hyatt is modern and chic (almost W in feel but not quite to that extreme). There isn't much of a lobby to speak of, the check-in area looks more like the checkout counter at a local Apple store; there is a living room-esque area off of the lobby with an electronic fireplace (it still looked comfortable), books on shelves, and some interesting, modern artwork and sculptures. I was accommodated on a high floor but had a view of the city that wasn't the most appealing, and unfortunately I could hear the drone of the elevator banks nearby. The furniture in my room was a bit worn in places but I found the space to be otherwise very comfortable, the bed particularly so. The bathroom continued the modern feel of every other room and had a large walk-in shower, a bowl type sink, and what I can only describe as hip, bold colors. The exercise room is almost at the every top of the hotel and this space has wonderful, sweeping views of the city. I could not help but get distracted during my workout with the view of skyscrapers at eye level and an equally beautiful view of the bay. I did not dine in the hotel but there was a restaurant on the mezzanine level that seemed well attended for breakfast and dinner. There is also a Starbucks open during the morning hours in the lobby, but there was literally a dozen other Starbucks (as well as independent coffee shops, diners, restaurants) right outside the hotel doors. Being in Union Square, there is no lack of dining and shopping to be had as well as easy access to MUNI and other mass transit options. I did not engage with many of the hotel staff, but those that I did chat with were friendly and personable. I expect to return to San Francisco again, hopefully in the near future, and would definitely keep the Grand Hyatt on my list of properties to stay at.",5-Apr-18,4
"I had a great stay at the Grand Hyatt. It's location is great. Smooth check-in, nice doormen, helpful housekeeping, and a laid back environment. My room was very clean and spacious. Way better than all the smaller, boutique hotels in the area. Plus, great views. It's the only location I would recommend.",4-Apr-18,5
"This was our first time in San Francisco, and we had a great time. Admittedly being a little nervous, especially from what you see about SF on the news. The hotel was great and conveniently located to Union Square and the various modes of mass transit. The hotel was clean, and was available for early check-in as requested. The room was a comfortable size, though we spent little time at the property because we were always going somewhere. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.",3-Apr-18,5
I had a great stay at Grand Hyatt San Francisco. The location is great! I love the service and location here!!! I had breakfast at the hotel. The food was great and the service at the restaurant is OK,2-Apr-18,4
"Very nice place to stay in downtown San Francisco. Close to all major attractions and transportation. A little bit pricey, but worse it. I think from three major brands we have stayed during our California trip (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt), Hyatt is the best one.",1-Apr-18,5
"The bed was like sleeping on cement, way too hard. Everything else in the and the hotel was good. Too much light coming from the hallway for sleeping due to the space under the door and space between the sliding shade. ",31-Mar-18,4
I had a conferrence there and stayed 2 nights. It was super cool. The hotel is big and in the core center of the city. We had a party in one of the last floors and it was super! Very nice views from above,31-Mar-18,5
Less well maintained than I expected for a Grand Hyatt.The attached photos show mold growing on the bathroom ceiling and the fan in the bathroom. For the brand and the price I expect better. I have stayed before and not noticed the mold.Heading to the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort and hope it is in better condition.,30-Mar-18,3
"Iâ€™ve stayed at this Hyatt several times before this week - despite my booker requesting a quiet room (letâ€™s face it, it really shouldnâ€™t be necessary to request this) I was given an interconnecting room backing onto the lift-shaft - after having flown from the UK and around the US before arriving in San Francisco, this was pretty disappointing - the lifts were very noisy and ran all night, as were the next-door guests - will take myself and my team somewhere else next time - avoid 2501!",30-Mar-18,3
"We must have tried most of the hotels in the Union Square area, and the Hyatt remains a favorite. Situated at the back of the giant Apple Store in Union Square, with a common outdoor garden area in between, the Hyatt is conveniently located in the corner of Stockton and Sutter. There is a CVS and Starbucks just across the road. Union Square is one block away. There are also 2 self-parking, in and out, garages nearby (with priority access for hotel guests) if you don't want to hand keys to the valet.Check-in was fast, with excellent service. The only thing that got me was the $5 charge per package delivery. I was unaware of this charge and I had so many orders that came in from Amazon. So imagine my surprise with the bill!Club floor rooms are spacious. My only problem is the noise. Walls are not well insulated and so you can practically hear bedroom activities next door.Club lounge has great food. Just go early or there won't be any seats left. We ended up taking out some of the food sometimes.With all these it still remains a favorite, though.",28-Mar-18,5
"First and foremost -- reserved a VIP suite and was pleasantly surprised at check in to be upgraded the Presidential Suite.The city views from the floor to ceiling windows and 2200SF for my family to spread out in truly made our trip. The private sauna was over the top and amazing.Staff was excellent from check-in, valet, to room service.Quality of room service breakfast was amazing, and made it easy when we had early morning plans.Two items for negative feedback:1. Suite linens are dark brown in bed and bath, prefer standard white.2. When leaving for the airport, requested a taxi and was advised by the doorman the ""house car"" Lexus was available for the same price as a taxi. As this was a better option, I accepted the offer only to have the driver pull away and demand he be paid in cash -- he went so far as to tell me if I didn't have cash we would need to pull over at an ATM to get cash. As a woman traveling alone, this was EXTREMELY disconcerting as I was forced to get out of a car several blocks from the hotel and leave my luggage in the car to use an ATM outside of a night club. Either be up front about cash requirement for use of house car or accept credit card.",28-Mar-18,5
"I stayed in the hotel for business. I had asked for a room with a view of the park, and got a room that had a partial view, which was nice. The bed was comfortable, my room was quiet despite being near the park, and the staff was cordial and helpful. The hotel itself was pleasant enough, but I didn't feel like the hotel was anything special (at least, to warrant five stars).",26-Mar-18,4
"Check was quick and easy. The front desk was so welcoming and friendly. He answered all of our questions, gave us suggestions, and was fun to talk to. The concierge helped us choose a few activities, and suggested one of my favorite activities of the trip. The Hornblower Dinner Cruise. Our room had a great view, was clean ,modern decor, very comfortable. There was a nice area with a vanity and makeup mirror. No issues with the room. We had snack and drinks in the bar, they put together a meat and cheese tray for us that was not on the menu. Staff was very friendly, professional, took good care of us. My only complaint is that the advertised skyline view on 36th floor was closed for private events every night. Overall we had a great stay. ",26-Mar-18,4
"Stayed at this property for 2 nights in March, was a given a room on the 29th floor which had quite a nice view but that's about it. The room furniture was dated with the closet doors not being able to close completely. Had access to the Grand Club on level 32 which was always crowded especially during breakfast..! Annoyed with the service standard which was generally pathetic and a blatant double standard of service by one of the female staff. This is one property I would avoid at all cost unless you're willing to pay just for the location. A VERY ""UNGRAND"" Hyatt..!",26-Mar-18,3
"this is a perfect location to stay with or without family. walking distance to shopping center , coffee shops, restaurants. rooms are small but clean.right front of union square, we were here between Christmas and new year. you can feel the real Christmas!",25-Mar-18,5
"We had an excellent stay with our extended family at this hotel. The location is the best for shopping, cable cars, Chinatown and eating. We had very nice rooms on the 27th floor with a beautiful city view. The rooms were attractive and very clean as was the servicing of the rooms each day. We were there for 5 nights. Breakfasts were good with enough choices to keep everyone happy. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and helpful. The Concierge - Vanessa was extremely helpful and really took the time and the effort to make sure we had a good day at Alcatraz.",23-Mar-18,5
"How much time do you have?If you are interested in being deceived by your hotel, ORIf you don't want your hotel to be open, upfront and honest with you, ORIf you want to be kept up all night by creaking walls... then stay at this hotel!Otherwise.....STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!!To begin with, I was told I would be able to get an early check in. I was to speak at a conference there and our flight was delayed. So, I needed to get into a room to freshen up and change. When we got there, our room was not ready. They tried to give us a lower quality room (no view) if we didn't want to wait. We decided to wait.While waiting, we decided to go have lunch upstairs at the only restaurant. The food was ok, but the restaurant management was more concerned about meal presentation than functionality. My wife's salad was on such a tiny plate, all the contents kept falling off onto her shirt, lap and all over the table. According to the waiter, they had been told about this several times previously....Later that night, we went elsewhere for dinner. We decided to go back to the hotel for dessert. At that same restaurant, we let the host know we wanted dessert. We were told to go into the bar! The bar was crowded and noisy! AND we don't drink alcohol!!! All we wanted was dessert! We told the manager that we just wanted to sit down and have a dessert. The manager told us to go into the bar if all we wanted was dessert!!!!! Seriously??? Are you kidding????When we went to bed, we kept hearing a creaking noise in the closet. It was loud and very annoying. It was not a ""rhythmic"" noise; it was very random. But neither of us were able to get to sleep. We tried for over 2 hours to get the noise to stop (we thought it was the closet doors creaking because they would not close properly). Nothing we tried got the noise to stop. We finally realized that it was inside the walls and ceiling of the closet!!!We called the front desk and spoke to the manager. The manager of this hotel told us this:- They know about the creaking- It happens when there's bad weather- It happens all the time- It happens in every room in the hotel (which , by the way was sold out that night)We asked why we were not told about this before (while) making the reservation. She said that they 'sometimes send out letters'!!! Are you kidding????? We told her we never received a letter and she could not confirm if we were sent one. However, they did have our correct address.Then she changed her story and said that this storm 'creeped' up on them'!!! Again, do you take me for a fool??Then the manager of this HYATT hotel said the most appalling thing:""There are ear plugs in the bathroom"" Again....ARE YOU KIDDING ME????This is not the Motel 6! This is a flipping HYATT!!!! I expect a LOT better from a HYATT brand hotel than, ""there are earplugs in the bathroom""!!!This HYATT hotel room was over $700 for ONE night, PLUS TAX!!!! And there solution is earplugs????? WOW!!!!!!This obviously PROVES they were aware of the issue but failed to notify us before or while the reservation was being made.So, they generously (kidding) offered to take $50 off our room rate! That was sooooo nice of them (kidding). It was not until my wife became very upset that they very reluctantly took half off our room rate. To which our response was, ""We are not going to get half a nights sleep"".... And we didn't.We go no sleep! So, we got up extra early and checked out of the hotel. As long as I live, I will NEVER stay in a HYATT hotel again!!! EVER!STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!! (You were warned!!)",23-Mar-18,1
"Reserved king suite for 3...two adults and one teenager. Very roomy but the couch for our son was not a pull out. Would have had to pay additional $30/night for rollaway bed. Fortunately, couch was fairly comfortable and he has his own space and bathroom. Beware of room near elevators because of constant â€œwhooshingâ€ù sound. Really, our only complaints. Hotel is ideal location....for walking to attractions, shopping and restaurants, also convenient for ride share location. Will return. ",22-Mar-18,4
"I read about Grand Hyatt as the best place in Union Square to be. I booked it for my wife. It turns out to be a rip off. The price advertised on booking.com was around US$ 1,300 for 4 nights... The amount blocked on the card by the hotel is almost US$ 2,300 and the man at the reception says the system showed the price and did it! Is this hospitality! Trust me this attitude would have meant the property would have been out of business. My wife is travelling alone and this amount blocked on second day if a long trip has put her entire trip in jeopardy. I hope tourists to San Fransisco avoid this hotel as they are just shamelessly unapologetic about their conduct.",22-Mar-18,1
"I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt last weekend, because I've had pleasant experiences at other locations. The check in service was quick and easy, the location is central to all the shopping in the world, and hotel itself is very nicely kept.I'm not sure what I was expecting for the price, but I wasn't overwhelmed by my room, but it did get the job done, and was quite comfortable. The Wi-Fi was slightly slow and spotty, but it's also free so take it for what it is when +100 people are using it ;) The TVs are a bit slow, but you have access to plenty of channels, and the possibility to connect to your streaming services.The gym is quite small, and spills into the elevator lobby. In fact it's quite odd that they have equipment in the lobby, when you still have to have a key card to get into the main part of the gym.All and all it was simply an okay experience, and I'm still on the fence if it was worth the value. Something tells me I could've saved a few hundred by staying elsewhere having received the same quality. Perhaps I'm an outlier, but I'm just trying to be honest about how I felt staying here.",22-Mar-18,3
Nice hotel in a good location. Has a small area in front of hotel to pull over for loading and unloading. Did not use valet as we returned rental car same evening we arrived. Very close walk to Chinatown and other shopping located near Union Square. Elevators were quick with little wait.Used this location as a base for seeing the sights around San Francisco. Took Uber or Lyft as needed.Starbucks and CVS across the street. McDonalds next door. Numerous other shops and restaurants within close walking distance.Area seemed safe and no issues while we were there. I would stay here again if in town.,20-Mar-18,4
The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is in the perfect location in Union Square. The hotel is extremely well maintained with a a superb staff - from the valet to the front desk to the restaurant! I enjoy returning to this property and have never had a bad experience. ,19-Mar-18,5
"This is a lovely hotel, and a great location in Union Square. Centrally located in San Francisco close to shopping and many restaurants. Perfect for all there is to see in San Francisco. Great views of the city in many rooms. Our room was on a higher floor and we looked out to the east, really beautiful. Loved opening the curtains via a switch from our bed. A big â€œta daâ€ù to the day. Our room was very comfortable, not real large but it was perfect. Super comfortable bed and pillows made for a great nights sleep. When I said quiet that is because there is construction going on in the center of Union Square and inside the hotel we didnâ€™t hear any of that. A really nice plus if youâ€™re on the go and donâ€™t have time for a sit down breakfast, they have coffee and breakfast and probably lunch sandwiches already made they can heat up and actually theyâ€™re very good! On one of the first floors near the doors that are across from the Apple store.  Everyone is so friendly at the hotel and at your service. Nice being offered water when you arrive and having a quick and smooth check in. A nice Hyatt property in San Francisco.",18-Mar-18,5
"This was a hotel that we chose for its central location . The room was fabulous with a double walk in shower, kept very clean and superb views.We actually stayed here as we were getting married at City Hall and the hotel gave us champagne on the day .They were extremely helpful in anyway and the cleaning, bed making etc was all to suit, if you wanted a lay in they would come back later.I would definately stay here again.",14-Mar-18,5
"We stayed for 3 nights and the VIP suite was amazing. Large lounge , dining area and a separate bedroom. The views were beautiful. MY biggest disappointment was that we paid for a VIP Suite and we didn't get the lounge included in the room. I would expect paying this amount for a room it would be included.",14-Mar-18,4
I have to stay Iâ€™ve never stayed at a place other than Disney world where people were so friendly kind and went out of their way to provide great service. It has to be a culture thing there for it to be absolutely every person. It made a an average stay into a great one! ,13-Mar-18,5
"This is a fantastic hotel, right in the centre of San Francisco on Union square. The restaurant is expensive, breakfast was 32 dollars each but there are lots of diners nearby so you won't be stuck. Great location for venturing out to Chinatown, the Italian quarter or down to the water front. The shops and cable cars are just outside the door",12-Mar-18,5
"Came in at 2 am after driving from L.A. and upon arrival, the Front Desk agent, Jessica I believe that was her name, was very accommodating. Service was great from start to finish at this Grand Hyatt. Acess to the Club was also provided which allowed for free continental breakfast and drinks all day.The restaurant food was quite good as we didn't feel like venturing out on Saturday night.",12-Mar-18,5
"Stayed in room 2411 and it was noisy, was next to the room where the staff kept supplies and it was very noticeable. Room service was good, except there was not much room left when he brought the table in. Staff was friendly. I thought it was a horrible bed as it was so hard and that is personal preference but if you like a softer mattress this wasn't it. Granddaughter tried to take a pic out the window and it was filthy. Did have free wifi and that was a plus.",11-Mar-18,3
"I stayed here for a quick business trip (2 nights). They welcomed me back, my last stay was a few years ago. Early check in, comfortable beds and centrally located,adjacent to Union Square (starbucks across the street for those who care), plenty of plugs and outlets in tue room. The staff was great, room service menu varied and delish. Fitness area well equipped, but gets busy in the morning. Would stay here again.",11-Mar-18,5
"Fantastic location on Union Square and 3 minutes from China Town. The hotel restaurant was very good as was the bar. The choice and quality of food was fine with good quality. The bar had a great selection of cocktails, craft beers and ales. The staff were welcoming and professional. There were many excellent bars and restaurants within a 10 minute walk with the Cable Car a few short steps away. The views from the Bay View rooms were excellent but would suggest as high a room as possible. The bed was really comfortable a bit on the harder side which would be great for bad backs. Overall a great well located solid 4 star hotel.",10-Mar-18,5
"I stayed in a king bedded room on the 21st floor while in town on business. The room was clean, comfortable and stylish, and although not large, it wasn't cramped either. The room was generally quiet and I slept well. The ""tub style"" sink in the bathroom was very original, but needlessly cut down on usable counter space (see photo). My only minor complaint was that I could hear the TV in the neighboring room through the connecting room door. It wasn't overly intrusive, but it was noticeable.The location, just a block north of Union Square, was excellent. There are no shortage of shops and restaurants within a short walk of the hotel.Hyatt is not one of usual ""go-to"" brands. That may need to change.",8-Mar-18,4
"The hotel itself isn't bad and is probable exactly what one would expect from a Hyatt hotel. However my room, 2211, was right next to a staff room and you could hear the door opening and closing so night. Very annoying . Would not advice staying the that room or any adjacent rooms",8-Mar-18,3
"Room was clean and beds were comfortable. The cleaning staff were loud. I was on a work call and the room next to me was getting cleaned. They kept hitting the wall with the vacuum. I checked in after midnight and no bellman was outside. I waited for valet parking over ten minutes, called the hotel operator to get someone outside to take my car. It was raining. There was a bellman standing inside but he was not paying attention to hotel guests arriving outside. The front desk staff and bellman (late evening) lacked in attention to detail and good service.",8-Mar-18,4
"The staff are very helpful and sweet . Check in was easy. Breakfast was great. Only problem is the room . I wish after I am Hyatt member and part of other membership, I should have a better room.Wish it is better experience ",7-Mar-18,3
Very nice staff and front desk. Offered check in before standard check in time and baggage storage. Hotel location is really convenient to any SFO attraction. But the parking was a rip off :) Tons of stores / restaurants in walking distance.,4-Mar-18,4
My husband and I regularly stay here and this trip didnâ€™t disappoint. Reasonably appointed rooms with incredible views if you can get a high floor on the bay side. The club is so good you could easily enjoy dinner there if you were too tired to adventure out. I dislike Hyattâ€™s mediocre bathroom product choices (June Jacobs? Trade up to something good!) so I do bring my own toiletries. ,4-Mar-18,5
Great staff and amazing service Love the location and great viewsRooms were clean modern and maintained so well.They have the longest tenure Hyatt Associate at the door. Great man and keeps giving that great smile,3-Mar-18,5
"Got an excellent rate for the weekend online. Chose because it was close to Union Square but it had an even better location than we anticipated, literally steps from everything. Staff were friendly and very responsive. The gentleman at check in was efficient and professional but maybe a tad curt (definitely not rude). The room on 18 had a great view over the city. The decor looked like it was from the 90â€™s or 00â€™s but has been very well maintained so no problem there. In room dining was usual hotel fare. Would certainly stay there again when in San Fran and enjoyed the city! ",1-Mar-18,4
"We enjoyed the stay .Because if its location, it was easy access to everything !Clean and comfy , quiet rooms , supply of bottled drinking water whenever needed .Housekeeping did a good job Everyday.Front desk personnel were friendly and helpful .The way the rooms were arranged in the building , we didnâ€™t get much disturbance by people walking or talking or rolling their luggage along corridors .I would recommend this hotel to my friends ",28-Feb-18,4
"hwsteinOrinda, California This review was initially posted in error as a review for the Hyatt Regency. Different hotel completely. Sorry.  San Francisco has the most spectacular urban view in the country. Iconic buildings, bridges, Bay Views with Alcatraz. One of the best ways to drink this all in is to book a Bay view room at the Hyatt Regency on Union Square. We live just across the Bay but stayed recently to share a four way birthday bash with my wife, sister and brother-in-law who flew up from Los Angeles. Our rooms were nothing special (except for the view). The bath amenities were cheap. No minibar or fridge. No glasses, except in the bathroom. The electric shade was a nice touch as was the floor level nightlight that went on automatically when you left the bed and turned off when you returned. The location on Union Square is great for walks (San Francisco is a great walking city), great for shopping and surrounded by a number of excellent restaurants. We were on the Concierge Level with access to evening canapes, inexpensive (honor bar) cocktails, full buffet breakfast and, of course, an amazing 32nd floor view of the Bay. The check-in was a pleasant experience owing to the extremely cordial service of Ira (a woman) who was charming. If you're local, it's a nice place to hang out for celebrating that special occasion when driving home is the last thing you want to do. For tourists, you can't go wrong. It's not a luxury hotel (the city has plenty of those), but its other qualities make this a fine choice.",26-Feb-18,4

"We spent one night in this hotel. The location near Union Square is simply perfect. Staff was super helpful. Hotel price was quite steep but pretty much ok for this location. Our room was not really spectacular, but all clean and ok for just one night. I would recommend and go there again.",25-Feb-18,4
"Great location in the city. Staff is very helpful, polite and accommodating. We came in on the red eye and got to the hotel after midnight. I called ahead to make sure they kept our room and there was absolutely no problem. They gave us a beautiful room on the 25th floor with a great view of the bay and the city. There is a doorman during the day and early evening who helped us with directions, getting a cab, helping with our luggage. The room was lovely, bathroom modern and a separate sitting area outside the bathroom to put on your makeup or dry your hair. The bed was comfortable. We were busy most of the day, touring the city, but it was nice to come back to a comfortable room.",24-Feb-18,5
"Spacious rooms, great location - choose a high floor if you can. This hotel lives up to its reputation. Itâ€™s also energy efficient, so no unnecessary bath robes, waters etc, but all available on request. ",24-Feb-18,5
"These days, whenever I stay at a Hyatt, I think about how the brand has transformed from state-of-the-art in the 70s and 80s to rather nondescript and dated today. The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco is no exception; built in 1972, it will never deliver on architectural flourishes or room decor ""wow moments."" I didn't find the bed particularly comfortable, and after staying in hotels with luxurious bedding most nights of our trip, the older mattress and thin blanket at the Grand Hyatt was a letdown. We did get a room on a high floor, and the view was amazing... definitely a highlight. We paid for it, though, and the price tag veered into the ""luxury"" range, even though the accommodations were really not.In summary, I'd say that it's good for one night.",22-Feb-18,3
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for two evenings over the weekend. Itâ€™s an excellent location! A centrally-located hotel always wins in my book. I was able to walk to both Union Square and Chinatown. The service was good and my room was quite spacious and clean. (I also had a nice view, always a bonus.)",21-Feb-18,4
"When I first entered the room, it looked clean but very soon, I was really shocked. I could stand The black dust on the bed but there was someone's fingernails on the bed!!!! OMG... It's the worst hotel ever !! ",17-Feb-18,1
"I stayed here a couple of times in December, just before Christmas. The check-in both times was fine and the staff were friendly, although a bit distracted at times. I was in a club room the first time and a standard room the second time. The club room was larger with a nicer view and it was on a higher floor. It also gave me access to the club lounge, which was a nice bonus but I'm not sure that it was worth the extra money. The food was good but there was a fee for the alcoholic drinks (honor system) plus it was pretty crowded during my visits. The rooms were good, nice beds, nice bathrooms (club room had a more spacious bathroom while we had to get the bathroom cleaned in the standard room since it was not cleaned when we arrived). My biggest complaint about both rooms was that each of them had an LED light that came on when you rolled off the bed during the night. It was a good idea in concept but it was pretty annoying since the light was bright enough to light quite a bit of area and there was no way to turn it off until it went off after about 10 seconds. The location of the hotel was outstanding as there were a ton of restaurants in the area and it was about a minute walk to Union Square and about ten minutes to many of the other tourist areas. The exercise room was on a top floor but it was pretty small and very crowded. It could definitely use an upgrade. All in all, it was a good stay, 3.5 out of 5. For the location alone, I would definitely consider staying there again.",17-Feb-18,4
"Great location! But breakfast is expensive and hasn't many options... Besides, they charged my card US$5 for each mail Item delivered (both the packages and the letters!). As the Union Square region has many other lodging options, I would advise trying another one...",16-Feb-18,2
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 days for business. Check in was wonderful and I was even offered as much bottled water as needed for my stay. The room was very spacious but dated. It was located across from Union Square and easy access to anywhere. My one complaint and a bit disappointed with the hotel is that one day I had no house keeping. It was my last day/night and I was gone from early morning until just before midnight. When I returned after a long day, all I wanted to do was shower and get into bed. I wasnâ€™t calling down to the front desk so late. When I checked out the following morning, I told the front desk and they did apologize. They asked why I wouldnâ€™t have called to have them up to my room. I explained the time etc. I thought perhaps they would have offered to adjust the price or a voucher or something. They did not.At any rate, despite that, my stay was comfortable for the price and I would consider staying there again if the price was right. ",14-Feb-18,3
"5 stars for the uncomfortable desk chair award. 1950's rust orange with an emitting heat that transforms your seat into an uncomfortable scratchy itch. Since it does not move up or down, the only way to sit at your desk - even if you are 6 foot 3 like me - is to put pillows on the chair. Even then it is unworthy. This fact alone is enough for me to switch hotels. Is it to much to ask for a $100 adjustable walmart chair when paying $350 for a room?",12-Feb-18,1
This is an excellent hotel for a city break or business trip - the hotel is well maintained and in a good location. The rooms are really comfortable and at night they are dark and quiet. The staff are very friendly and polite. Iâ€™ll continue to use ,11-Feb-18,5
I stayed here for a couple of nights and so glad I picked this hotel. It was my first time to visit SF and it really was convenient to stay at a place where itâ€™s right in the middle of all actions and in close proximity to the different tourists attractions. Not to mention the room itself was super nice and clean and I was very happy with the customer service as well. Iâ€™ll definitely stay at Grand Hyatt again when I go back and visit sometime in the future ,11-Feb-18,5
"Fantastic stay at this hotel. Best location for getting to each area, really central. Love the decor, the view was gorgeous, had wine and nibbles at One Up which was fantastic. The gym is great- helps to keep running when the view is so good. Highly recommend this hotel. ",7-Feb-18,5
"Thought this would be an OK hotel to stay as the 'cosmetics' look good, however, the interior now dated and worn. Paid extra for a suite 'with city views' - the 'suite' is just two rooms where the door has just been opened and a couch put in one of them (it has two bathrooms.. As here for a three night stay and went to ask for a room change due to the 'underground' (next to a lift well) noise that is 24/7 (even trains stop for a limited time), told that no other 'suites' available. City View in this hotel also means looking out onto two monolitic grey buildings. Horrid trying to sleep with the noise. If you have options take them.",7-Feb-18,3
"Huge Hotel, Fast Checkins and a really central location.. this hotel is everything a hotel needs to be! It's close to all of the piers and transportation (bus or HOHOs, etc) and they pay a lot of attention and care to the guest experience. We used their restaurants as well as cocktail lounge etc and everything was absolutely wonderful :) Overall a great stay and could do it again!! :)",7-Feb-18,4
"My stay at the Grand Hyatt was very pleasant. The room was clean and comfortable me with plenty of desk space on which to work. I enjoyed the fitness center and its spectacular views. Most important, though, was the welcoming and helpful staff. If you are looking for a good business hotel in SF, you cannot go wrong here. An added plus: a nice view from my room. ",4-Feb-18,5
"This is our go-to hotel in San Francisco. Great location, great staff, and comfortable accommodations. Splurge on a Club Level room and enjoy a beautiful breakfast and happy hour daily. It's also an easy walk to shopping, restaurants, and China Town.",3-Feb-18,5
"Located in the middle of union square with shops such as cvs, starbucks, mcdonalds, walgreen, 7-eleven surrounded it. Sears fine food just a block behind the hotel, easy to have nice breakfast before starting your day.Concierge staffs were friendly, always on standby to open the door for you with a smile. Reception staff was ok, standard friendly but nothing over the top. No queue in front of me during check in but staff was fast to get us a room. The check-in was done in 2-3mins.Stayed in an Executive Suite with union square view. Big and clean room. Comes with 2 bathrooms (of which 1 with comes with a tub) which was useful. My husband and I could use the bathroom at the same time without having to wait for each other.Ordered room service one night - roast chicken, fries, drumletts & cheesecake. Order delivered within half an hour. Served with bread and butter. Chicken & fries was nice. Couldnâ€™t care for the drumletts, did not enjoy the spicy marinate. Cheesecake was ok (could have better ones at cheesecake factory at macyâ€™s just across the street). Staff who delivered the food was quite friendly.Would say that Grand Hyatt is a clean hotel with friendly staffs (no exceptional service encountered in my 3 nights stay). Location is good, with easy access to lots of retail shops, restaurants and transportations (cable car, street car, etc). While a few homeless people can be seen around the area, none was seen at the front door of the hotel. Still feel pretty safe when walking around at 9pm+ around the hotel. Would recommend to give Grand Hyatt a try when visiting San Francisco.",3-Feb-18,4
"Fabulous staff, very nicely decorated property, and awesome room furnishings, and amenities. And of course you canâ€™t beat the location at Union Square to BART and MUNI, restaurants, shipping etc. and if you get Club access, youâ€™re in for a treat!",2-Feb-18,5
"I just spent 3 nights at the GH on Union SQ. I am a Hyatt Rewards member with several hundred thousand points, so I almost always stay with Hyatt when I can. I was there for a conference on business travel. I've been to SF dozens of times throughout my life, in fact, I lived the the Bay Area as a child and have fond memories of visiting the city while in grade school.My stay at the GH mirrored my overall experience of the city. I don't think I'll plan another trip to SF ever again unless my business absolutely requires it.The good about the hotel: - Clean, quiet, and generally a pleasant atmosphere. The not so good: - Service attitude was very inconsistent. In some cases, irritating at best.In one encounter, I received excellent attitude and service with a smile. In this case, I ordered a steak Medium, it came well done, the bartender insisted that I return it and made a very genuine effort to ensure my satisfaction. It felt great to have someone really care about my experience. I liked him, he was warm and genuinely friendly.In another encounter, not so much. While sitting at the bar the next evening, I had to endure what appeared to be a middle manager and bartender complaining incessantly for about 5 minutes about their unsatisfactory work situation. I was trying to enjoy a glass of wine, but standing right in front of me at the bar, with their backs turned to me, they insisted on loudly complaining. It was pretty second rate. Especially after earlier having a drink at the bar at the Four Seasons (down the street) where the service and attitude was impeccable. Comparing the quality of service and attitude - just depressing, there was no comparison.Also, in the morning I went to check out, I tried to go up to the World of Hyatt Counter, but I encountered the same thing, two employees moaning about something, and one of the men turns to me and abruptly (and somewhat abrasively) says ""give me a few minutes"". Whatever - So I checked out on my phone and left, knowing that I wouldn't be back. I hate it when you pay $400-$500/ night for a room and get a ""Motel 6"" service attitude. Union shop, I'd guess.Anyways, the title ""Left Depressed"" comes not only from the attitudes I encountered at the hotel, but the completely abhorrent homeless situation all around the Union Square area. It's completely depressing to see mentally ill homeless people suffering in the streets as people shop at Tiffany's, Sacks, Gucci, etc. It's eerie and depressing. SF has really turned into a terribly strange place.",1-Feb-18,3
"I have a thing for Grand Hyatt Hotels: I usually love them. This one in San Francisco is very nice and did not disappointed. The rooms are very large, the bed is extremely comfortable and the breakfast is really good for both quality and choice. Concierge staff is very helpful and the location in city centre is perfect. I would love to come back.",1-Feb-18,5
"The hotel is in a great location! We were able to walk to Chinatown, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf and back from the Golden Gate Recreation Area. The staff is super friendly and the rooms very comfortable! We had a bay view room on the 19th floor. For our next stay, I would request a room on a higher floor. Be sure to head up to the top floor to see the amazing view of San Francisco!",30-Jan-18,5
"Truely a five star experience. From the time you pull-up until the time you pull out they take care of everything. Absolutely the best location by far downtown. Great prices and great accommodations. I would highly recommend this venue for business, pleasure, shopping or any other reason to go to San Francisco. ",30-Jan-18,5
"Middle of the everything in San Francisco. Good Stay. We enjoyed our stay and had a great view of the city. Recommend taking tours from here to wine country, Alcatraz, Muir Woods, and Yosemite Park.Enjoyed all.",30-Jan-18,5
"Very nice hotel, very clean and convenient location. Shopping centers are around the corner and very nice restaurants are not that far away. Chinatown is couple blocks away. it is very ideal place to stay. ",30-Jan-18,5
Quiet hotel with good location.Rooms are small. Front desk very helpful but concierge service was not up to expectation. Asked for the name of a seafood restaurant and was given the name of a steak place. They seemed more interested in arranging tours etc then answering basic questions.,28-Jan-18,3
The location was the only impressive aspect of this hotel. In desperate need of a heavy renovation. Room walls are made out of paper. Hi can hear the person next to you go to the bathroom. The hotel bar and restaurant was 3 star hotel standard at best. Rooms were extremely weathered.,28-Jan-18,1
I spent a lot of time researching and selecting a hotel close to the Moscone Center. The Grand Hyatt was perfect. Close enough to walk or a short cab ride. Concierge was outstanding. Highly recommend. You will not be disappointed as I wasnâ€™t. ,27-Jan-18,5
"Easy checkin, great bars, beautiful view. I thoroughly enjoyed my vertigo inducing view amidst the high rises in SF, the balcony was top notch. The gym was small and a pool would be appreciated. Prompt service for everything, a typical Hyatt experience.",27-Jan-18,5
"Already stayed here twice. It's always been my hotel of choice whenever I come visit San Francisco because of it's accessibility to everything. It's in Union Square, so basically once you step out, Starbucks is just across the street and CVS too. Just a few more steps Macy's around the corner, where Cheesecake Factory is on the top floor. Then you wouldn't want to miss the chance to ride the street cable railway and the first station is also just a good 5minute walk. Shopping? No problem! Express, Gap and a few malls are everywhere. It's just the perfect place to stay at. And before I forget, the view, the view is just as outstanding as the location, and the rooms are spacious with two double beds, good for 4 pax to stay conveniently.",27-Jan-18,5
"The hotel boosts a wide range of art pieces and sophisticated interiors, perfect for business travellers and couples alike. I appreciated the unique and not-your-typical front desk which looks like a business centre, in a very good sense. =) Different experience indeed. Staff are helpful and warm.",25-Jan-18,5
i was so pleased with the Grand Hyatt. The location in Union Square makes walking to shops and restaurants easy and enjoyable. Te rooms are beautifully appointed. A panel nest to the bed controls all the lights and window shades. A night light goes on automatically when your feet hit the floor. Great emphasis on safety.,24-Jan-18,5
"The check-in process took a while but all good otherwise.Beds are comfortable and everything in the room was in working order.Perhaps a good idea to include a small amenities kit (razor, earbuds and cotton wool)?",24-Jan-18,4
we arrived a bit late and once we went out from our car .. the hyatt experience started ..everything from the entrance all the way into the room was great ... we stayed for 3 nights and watching people ice skating at night at Union Square was wonderful.inroom dining was great .. and the location even better ... usually i try to avoid staying at downtown but not when staying at Hyatt ...a bit expensive if you have a car but again ... parking is expensive in SF ..,22-Jan-18,5
"Nice hotel on UnionSquare. Good location for shopping, restaurants, walking to sites/museums, close to public transportation, etc. Lobby has an inviting fireplace and good restaurant & bar. However the registration area is ultra modern - just standing computer stations. Not very personal - difficult to converse with staff without everyone hearing. Rooms are clean and modern, but a bit small. Modern furniture and accessories makeup a lot of living space. Huge bathroom sink takes up all the counter space. Good lighting in bathroom, nice to have a mini fridge and large flatscreen TV. I would consider staying here again if I were in the area.",22-Jan-18,4
"I have Hyatt Globalist status and have stayed at all manner of properties within the Hyatt portfolio. My stay here was for 4 nights on a combination of free night certificates and World of Hyatt points. Overall:- The property, while well-located and generally satisfactory, needs renovations throughout and suffers from inconsistent service. I would not stay here again until it is renovated. Pros:- Although Union Square isn't my preferred part of the city, the location is certainly convenient location for most visitors- Service was generally friendly, although not always excellent (see below)- The Grand Club had pretty good offerings - multiple hot food options, inexpensive honor bar selections, and lots of coffee/water/juice/soda selections.Cons:- Renovations are needed everywhere - elevators, furniture, windows, etc.- The design of the bathroom was also curious - an enormous sink leaves little counter space, and the shower door opens out, requiring you to get wet in order to turn the shower on.- The restaurant and bar are configured strangely, on opposite sides of the 2nd floor with the elevator bank between them. This means both spaces frequently end up being too small for the crowds they serve.- Service at the bar was mixed. I arrived around 11pm after a late flight and wanted a drink and a bite to eat. Despite closing at 1am, the waiter decided on his own that ""last call"" was 90 minutes before closing. A manager overruled him but offered no gesture of compensation. - Speaking of overcrowding, the Grand Club is far too small for the demand at peak times. On multiple occasions there were zero seats available, and on one breakfast occasion there was literally a line out the door. Staff appeared unable or unwilling to adequately police the admittance of guests in excess of stated policies, as there were clearly some very large groups. Also, the hours of Club service are not posted outside of the Club itself, which was frustrating.- On the occasion of the line-out-the-door breakfast, the front desk agreed to comp me breakfast in the hotel restaurant instead. Unfortunately it took 3 tries to get the charge removed from my folio. - Doormen were frequently absent and/or inattentive in helping guests in and out of the property. - Union Square has really gone downhill. There is trash everywhere, and the homeless and ""busker"" situation is borderline out of control.",22-Jan-18,3
My girlfriend and I stayed here just before New Years. The hotel was unbelievably busy during our stay. We initially checked in in the morning and said we would wait for a room on a higher floor. When we returned in the late afternoon our room was still not available. We did not get into our room until after 5 pm. The front desk was very apologetic for the lateness of the hour and compensated us quite fairly. I checked out via email and had to call the hotel back to have my rate adjusted for this inconvenience. Unfortunately the notes in my file were not accurate however I remembered the name of the person who had taken care of the situation and it was rectified immediately. Our room was quiet considering it is the city. You still hear some city noise but it did not disturb our sleep. We did not hear any hallway noise. We had a room with two beds and it was spacious enough for us considering we had two luggages and did some shopping. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. There are great black out shades and I love that the button is next to the bed. There is also a sensor light for when you get up in the middle of the night. This is a plus and negative when you are sharing the room with someone else. The room was very clean which is a big plus for me. We used the services of the concierge on a few occasions. One lady was very nice and accommodating. There was a second concierge who was not that friendly and seemed to be put out with our questions. Overall this was a great trip. Given we were here over a busy period I appreciate the hotel giving us late checkout on our last day. I would stay here again next time I am in town.,21-Jan-18,5
"GH continues to set the standard in hotels. Iâ€™ve been to several locations around the world in 2017, and unfortunately have only got to experience GH in Melbourne and SF. I missed the opportunity in Waikiki and the Maldives. So in 2018, my first trip to SF was always going to include GH. He team have never disappointed.Great service; central location; awesome views; and comparable rates to like hotels in the area. Definitely will be back when next in SF. Iâ€™m just hoping to experience GH in another location.Thanks again.",21-Jan-18,5
"I stay at Hyatts all over the world. I booked a month in advance. Check here in is like going to a Apple Store and same result... stand in line... and everything is fully booked and sold out, you are lucky to get an extremely small room with a view of some ugly building for only 425USD. The club lounge was nice but way too small. Great service and food at the lounge. No idea why the charge for the wine here and it is a nice wine. Hint they have nice coffee out and everyone stands in line for the machines. I had problems with the room and the maintenances guy from Laos (I think) came and did a great job of fixing it. He even used a wet towel to clean the ceiling covers so dust did not fall down on the bed.The pay breakfast was very nice and the manager was very nice. Overall the property is just to overloaded and small for the price.",20-Jan-18,3
"From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by a very attentive Gliezl, making you feel so welcomed. Then, you meet a fantastic concierge, Elaine, who really cares about providing you with the best experience of San Francisco! We felt at home and very cozy in our beautiful room. The bed is super comfortable and the linen is great! One Up was a fun place to go to for meals and wine, especially with the nice atmosphere that the staff create! Thanks Mitch for our nice chats! We are totally happy we chose the Grand Hyatt to celebrate our 25th anniversary! Thanks to the friendly staff everywhere in this so-well located hotel! We would definitely come back and refer people to experience this Grand Hyatt!",20-Jan-18,5
"This hotel is right in the heart of downtown SF, right on Union Square. It is an excellent base for exploring the city, with nearby access to public transport and cable cars, plenty of shopping and food around as well. The hotel itself is well-kept, has friendly staff, and a high-quality restaurant on-site. Comfy beds, spacious bathroom, in-room wifi etc, all make the stay comfortable and easy.",19-Jan-18,5
This hotel is ok. Bell boys were great and eager to please. Found the check in process a little sterile with only men checking guests in. The noise at night from the lifts was unbearable. As all the rooms are located close to the lifts it doesnâ€™t give to an option to move. Would think about another hotel less noisy!!!!!! ,18-Jan-18,3
Stayed four nights on NYE and we had a blast in San Fran. The hotel is centrally located at the Union Square. A walking distance to Market Street station if you want to catch a ride on cable car. Also very close to Chinatown and bus stop are right in front of the hotel in case you need to go somewhere else. The hotel was very busy at times during check-in and check-out. We arrived early around 11:30 and there was no room available for us and had to wait until 3:30 before we got a text message that our room was ready. This hotel is great for business but not so for family as it doesn't offer any other amenities. ,18-Jan-18,4
"Here for a girls weekend, starting on the day of 'Santa-con'...so lots of activity, and the staff was great. Courteous and helpful. We were on the 21st floor with Bay views...Transamerica building and Coit Tower made for great pics - day and night...room was great, modern look. Located right off Union Square, great location. Enjoy",16-Jan-18,5
"Good location to Union Square. Enjoyed the hotel. Would prefer a room higher up in the hotel around 30th floor.Check in was quick.We were offered a bottle of wine complimentary. However, that bottle never arrived. :(Other than that everything was fine. Rooms were a good size.Room was spacious enough.Clean for the most part.Good gym. Has everything you need for a decent work out.Great location. ",16-Jan-18,4
"I stayed there with my family for 2 nights. First night I asked for upgrade to the club room and was told that it is sold out. Second night I asked first thing in the morning to upgrade and they offered to upgrade. I really enjoyed all of my stay. I enjoyed the club access as well. I wish that they would serve the desert with the appetizers so that we wouldn't have to wait or come back for it. Also, first night I went on the very top floor (floor 35) because it was labeled as a spot where you could check out the sunset/nice view in the elevator. When I got there, the door guy told me that it was a private event and I could not enter. He told me I could come back tomorrow to check it out. Next day, the 35 floor button wouldn't work. I found out from the front desk that the top floor is only reserved for private events. I think it should be open to at least your guests who are staying at the hotel.",16-Jan-18,5
"Hotel staffs (concierge, reception, housekeeper) were very nice and helpful. They all have great service minded. The hotel location is very convenient. Close to shopping malls and union square but still quiet and peaceful.",16-Jan-18,5
"Stayed her for 3 nights post Christmas I am a World if Hyatt Globalist (highest member level) and spend many night per year in hotels. To be frank this Hyatt is pretty average. The location is great, the one up bar / restaurant is nice (but itâ€™s the only food option). On the down side the hotel is very tired and needs renovation and the gym is terrible. Overall - itâ€™s average. By no means the worst hotel around, but as a grand hyatt itâ€™s down the list ",16-Jan-18,3
I had a terrible allergic reaction from their toiletries. My face was literarily turned beet red from using their soap. I went down to lobby and talked to the manager in charge if they could help me. He just pretty much shrugged his shoulder and said there is nothing he could do. He didnâ€™t even looked concern. All he offered was to give me a different toiletries. ,15-Jan-18,1
I travelled on business to SFO and stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel are spacious and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay here. The people are very hospitable and the restaurant is nice. Perfectly located if you want to sight see.,13-Jan-18,5
"The Grand Hyatt was the perfect choice for our one-night escape. We shopped in Union Square, walked to a great restaurant, indulged in a nightcap at the hotel bar, caught a cable car, and enjoyed a beautiful view from the 32nd floor. Ira in reception checked us in and could not have been more welcoming. We felt special thanks to her special attentiveness. Well done, Grand Hyatt!",13-Jan-18,5
"We travelled to San Francisco with our four young adult kids for a reunion with two other families and ski trip to Lake Tahoe. We chose the hotel as a group based on location and value. The hotel is nice, modern, with decent rooms. The walls are paper thin and we heard the loud antics of our neighbors one night. A nice pounding on the wall got them to quiet down. Great location, we walked everywhere and took a cable car. Parking was conveniently located around the corner with quick service and not too pricey for San Francisco. Unfortunately San Francisco smells strongly of urine and marijuana (skunk smell) so not too pleasant when walking around. It is still worth it to enjoy this beautiful city.",11-Jan-18,4
"Stayed here for a week in December and had a great stay!Rooms are a little dated but no chips or rips just not fully modern! The rooms, bathroom are big with plenty room in them. I loved they have a French doors as window so got a great view of the city and of course Macyâ€™s and the square where there was ice skating going on with the Christmas tree. All staff were lovely when we seen then, but the doormen were just lovely and so helpful. They greeted you at every time, first time this has happened in any hotel so this really stood out to me!Great location for anyone, bar is lovely and warm, on the smaller side but modern and you can sit back and enjoy your drink! We had a great stay and thank you! Would recommend anyone going to stay here and enjoy your stay!",10-Jan-18,5
"Grand Hyatt and westing have the best locations for any Union Square hotels. Am Hilton Diamond member and was so glad I didnâ€™t stay there - quality not up to other Hiltons and its 2 blocks in the wrong direction - homeless all over the sidewalks there and the street just smelled gross. Hyatt is on the right side of Union Square with the great shops and views in all directions (ask for higher floor). Staff lovely and helpfull. Whislt it didnâ€™t feel â€˜luxury 5 starâ€™ (decor more 4 star to me), it made up for that with the excellent location and staff service.",9-Jan-18,5
"Stayed here because my sister thinks grand hyatt is the only place in SF. Only the female receptionists is nice. I book 4 rooms for 3 nights. And the room reservation is also nice, they did place us all in the same floor, we traveled with baby and elderly. The very nice and warm female filipinos reception said, Do call 0 for anything you need from water to extra blanket. She was the only reason I am giving another extra 1 star here instead of 1. And when I did, wowza the lady who pick up the phone need some attitude training. She was super rude lazy and tells me you ask for water just now and you want more? when I called for extra water. somebody give her some small change please!No amenities is in the room, just soap shampoo.I really dont know if anyone notice here, but the room in hyatt is very very dusty.We always use the bell service and the worst bell service during my stay is always the same, grand hyatt SF. The room size is also small for the price paid, compare to some other hotel nearby and offer better service with a competitive price point.",9-Jan-18,2
The Grand Hyatt in SF is beautiful. The staff is very attentive and prompt to make your stay very enjoyable. Perfect downtown location close to everything with a Starbucks right across the street. Self parking was inexpensive and right across the street.,8-Jan-18,4
"- Location: It's located right at the union square. Good amount of shopping mall/restaurant within walking distance.- Parking: Valet is quite expensive, they have self assisted parking as well at the garage across the street. $40 for 24 hours is about the price you get in the city.- Service: Staff is friendly and helpful. They offered room amenity for my special occasion as well which is pretty sweet. One hiccup is that they didn't deliver it on time and I had to call the front desk to request it, which could have done better.- Room: Stayed at the 29th floor with Union Square view. Floor-to-ceiling window with modern decor. Overall the room looks really nice, one minor thing is the tub is quite small, but kind of expected due to the location- Grand Club: Definitely one of the best I've been. Had Risotto and short rib during the evening treat and chef did an awesome job. They also have a good selection of wine there for a minimum charge of ~$4.Overall this place is definitely recommended.",6-Jan-18,5
"Let me start off with the positive. Staff is on point and awesome (doorman, front desk, and club room). Room service was good, food delivered was tasty. Rooms were modern and I liked the large bath. Careful with the sink, too much water at once will cause it to overflow. The location is great especially to Chinatown to walking distance to wherever. We opted for Lyft most of the time due to some credit received. But loved the fact that everywhere was within walking distance if needed. Negatives...I'm short, how am I supposed to reach back and down for the toilet paper without hurting myself?!! We asked for maintenance through the bell man on the first day to change a lightbulb on one of our lighting that never came. Paid extra for club access. It was extremely overly busy as we expected, was more so on Dec 29, Friday. There are a lot of rude and entitled members in the club room. It seems those persons know it's busy with families and couples but still throw their jackets on seats so no one would sit next to them. I've worked in tower rooms that offer the same at a five star resort so I was disappointed in staff that they can't tactfully watch and communicate with those guests to help others. Club access offered the same breakfast 3 days in a row? Really?!? The late afternoon offering had pasta but on Friday night they stepped up and went with the BBQ ribs, still preferred to go else where. I'd stay again only for location but maybe not pay extra for club access. ",5-Jan-18,3
"This property is huge. We arrived at the same time as 4 bus loads of football players and family members so it was chaotic waiting for elevators. The staff did a good job managing the chaos. We had a one bedroom suite and it was ok. The room as clean but it needed to be refreshed with worn furniture and nicks on the walls. My encounters with the staff in all departments was positive. The high point was the club level lounge. The breakfast was plentiful and had a good variety. The evening hors were very nice. The view was beautiful overlooking San Francisco Ban and Alcatraz. Overall, I would stay here again because of the location and the club level lounge but it lacks overall wow factor.",5-Jan-18,4
"Our King room with a view of the Bay and Coit Tower was worth every penny. The room was clean and modern, the bed and pillows were comfortable and the staff was attentive and friendly. I brought my two teen kids here last summer and stayed in a room with a view of Union Square. It was fabulous then and it is still fabulous. The central location is unbeatable. The bar, bartender and waitress were also awesome.",5-Jan-18,5
Worse visit ever...we never recommend to anyone....itâ€™s better to stay at home rather than Hyatt...chairs were dirty...quilts were not properly washed....according to price location were not good....there were no microwave....itâ€™s hard with kids.,3-Jan-18,2
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for five night from the end of December to the start of January and we found the hotel didn't quite meet our expectations. There were positives though which included the location, close to union square, the comfy king beds and friendly staff. The negatives however overshadowed the positives for us. The first night we were placed in a room which had a noisy air conditioner unit so that it made noises whenever the rooms around us turned on their air con. We didn't get much sleep and asked for a new room as soon as we woke the next morning. They said this was fine and told us to prepare our luggage ready to move. We then had to check multiple times throughout the day for if the room would was ready as our bags were never moved and it wasn't until late afternoon when we returned to find our old room being cleaned but the new room not ready that they found a different room for us which we ended up moving our own stuff into. We were then disappointed to find that in the new room the sound of the elevators going up and down was very loud. We were disappointed in the service as we clearly wanted a quieter room but were moved to a noisier one. After expressing our unhappiness, the next day concierge showed up unannounced at around 6pm to take us to our new room but sleeping in a third room in three nights seemed too much and we were not prepared for the move at the time. In addition to the noise, we were also disappointed with the bathrooms. Both rooms had showers over a bath with a cloth screen which is not ideal in a honeymoon setting. The rooms generally lacked all the usually items such as shower caps, bottles of water, milk, etc. Overall, we have stayed in many Hyatt's around the world and this one left a bit to be desired. I would encourage couples looking for a romantic time away or a honeymoon to look elsewhere. ",3-Jan-18,2
"I booked a city view king bed room for four nights over the new year. According to the confirmation the room would be located on floors 20-29. When I arrived there seemed to be some kind of problem and the check in assistant had to go and see the manager. I then got a room on floor 14 with a less good city view. The view from the rooms was the main reason for booking this hotel so I was quite dissatisfied that Hyatt could not meet this expectation.The room could need better cleaning and was quite worn down. Location is very good and the staff was very friendly, but I will choose another hotel the next time I visit San Francisco.",3-Jan-18,3
"This is a decent hotel in close proximity to Union square. However, the hotel is dated and staff are not friendly. Food is reasonable. I have stayed here close to 10 times but this time I felt I was not welcome. Being a Hyatt member has no additional privilege in this hotel.Overall, low on value and great on location.",3-Jan-18,3
"This is an unbeatable location, it was easy to access everything and moments to anything. The room was a good size & we had an amazing view. The staff were friendly and helpful. Because of the location the hotel is obviously very busy and the lifts did take a while to come but itâ€™s worth it for the location and conveinience. I would definitely stay there again if I went back to San Fran. Monica Shor",2-Jan-18,4
"We were upgraded at a minor cost to stay in a VIP Suite. It was a wonderful room, wonderful location, well cared for. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. When we've made trips to San Francisco, this is our hotel of choice over the past fifteen years. We love the location next to Union Square and all of the shopping available in the area. The hotel food is excellent and overall we consider it to be the best hotel experience for your dollar in the area.",2-Jan-18,5
"*WARNING* - The staff at this hotel is unprofessional and gave us nasty customer service. There should be a rating of zero to fit in this hotel. We stayed at this hotel to celebrate New Years in the city. I had forgotten a few toiletries and called the hospitality staff to provide some of these items which were complimentary. The lady was SUPER RUDE and even questioned when I was checking out. The items were NEVER brought to our room. The staff could have been more accommodating, especially for being a premium class hotel. I even complained to the staff who checked me out, yet nothing seemed to be done to rectify the issue. Seriously, these workers should be educated on providing better customer service. This experience was utterly disappointing and ruined my trip. I will take my business elsewhere! We will not be coming back.",1-Jan-18,1
Spontaneous getaway with our college age kids home for break. Found Hyatt Hotel on Union Square to overlook Christmas decorations...walked to fantastic dinner. Hotel was reasonably priced and perfect!,1-Jan-18,5
"This is our third visit to Grand Hyatt San Francisco last 5 years. Excellent location especially if you get rooms facing Union Square. Check in process extremely quick. Concierge desk is very helpful especially Elaine - she gives you wonderful ideas to explore the city, car rental, athletic games, etc. Breakfast buffet is nice too. Food variety could be expanded to include some Asian fare, although Chinatown is 15-20 mins away. ",1-Jan-18,4
Great location. In the heart of Union Square. Great area for shopping for branded stuff. The staff there are great and make my stay really enjoyable. Great view from the room. Canâ€™t ask for anymore from Grand Hyatt SF. ,1-Jan-18,5
"The soaring main lobby of the hotel is beautiful and the exterior viewed elevators add to the character. The staff was welcoming and accommodating. The hotel is centrally located in the business district, but also a good location for tourists in the downtown area. We took the BART (rapid transport) from the San Francisco airport directly to the hotel. The rooms are on the small side- think city hotel. However, they are very clean and appointed well. We ate breakfast at the restaurant in the main lobby twice and felt that the ambience was rather cold. I think because the restaurant is enveloped in the enormousness of the lobby. Other than that the food was good and the server pleasant. ",1-Jan-18,4
"Rudely greeted on checkin, very noticable noise from neighboring rooms (little sound insulation), hotel restaurant is very Un-Grand with poor service and rude reception and poor food. A hotel without a proper lobby.",1-Jan-18,2
The location is convenient for many things. I think I walked to so many things and dinner. Was at the hotel for a week long conference. The gym is great - on the top floor of the hotel with great views.,31-Dec-17,4
We recently had a 6 night stay at the hotel with our 4 & 8 year old. The hotel had a beautiful Christmas feel and we found check in very easy. All the staff were very helpful especially Joe who was so kind to our son. The room was great & the bay view was amazing. With easy access to union square & Starbucks across the road it was perfect for shopping & quick easy breakfast.,31-Dec-17,5
"Just returned from a quick one night stay at this hotel. The location is excellent, adjacent to Union Square, and only a few blocks to walk to the BART station (line directly to SFO). The hotel was packed, however check in at the World of Hyatt counter was quick and efficient. I was upgraded to a suite on the 27th floor, which was very spacious and actually quiet during the night. I really appreciated that the bedroom window would be opened slightly for some fresh air. The club is on the 32nd floor, with wonderful views of the city. Food offerings were decent, with a couple of different pastas, soup, salad, and usual array of veggies and spreads. Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay.",30-Dec-17,5
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our stay in the wider SF area. We wanted a great standard, centrally located hotel, so we booked a club room at the Hyatt hoping for great things. Check in was terrible. A line the length of the lobby, total disorganisation, suitcases abandoned behind the counters, chaos everywhere. When we got to check in, bearing in mind we pre paid, check in took at least 15 minutes. No idea why! We requested a quiet club room and were given â€˜the only one availableâ€™ which was opposite the ice machine. When we got to the room we were underwhelmed. A camp bed was left in the room when we hadnâ€™t requested it, the furnishings were tired and dated, and worst of all everywhere looked like it just needed a good scrub! After 3 nights there, all of the stuff we left out became coveted in thick dust. Such a dirty room. The club lounge itself was very crowded most of the time. There are often times you need to line up for a seat - not exactly a relaxing experience. As soon as any food is put out, everyone crowds around and grabs it. Itâ€™s like feeding time at the zoo! On check out we asked to leave our bags for a few hours. The best they could offer us is to leave them right in the centre of the public lobby, where anyone could come and take them. The bag room was full. Elevators are a nightmare - there are never any to take you up or down and everyone seems to be waiting all the time. Positives for this hotel are the location - very central. The breakfast in the club lounge was adequate - it met our expectations where most other parts of the experience didnâ€™t. The views are also good from high floors. On reflection I would have preferred to take my $370+ a night and stay at a proper hotel of a decent standard. If Iâ€™d paid for a cheap chain then I wouldnâ€™t grumble, but this isnâ€™t value for money on any count (unless you take root in the club room and eat your own body weight in snacks - which some seemed to be doing). This hotel should be rated 3 star as itâ€™s tired, dirty, dated and more like a constant free for all for everything - breakfast, check in, elevators, check out. Boring. Not what you want on a break! ",30-Dec-17,2
"We had a marvelous stay during Christmas time. We booked double beds Union Square view, given a room at 25th floor and truly enjoyed the view of the Christmas tree & ice skating rink at Union Square. The beds are firm, pillows are standard but overall comfy. Room comes with coffee maker & fridge which is really nice. I love the spacious closet with drawers. Beautiful bathroom sink/vanity, with generous counter space. I appreciate that slippers were provided and free Wi-Fi, high speed to me. The fitness room is located on 35th floor fully equipped & nice view. Great customer service from the doorman, bell man, front desk, to the concierge. The lobby is very cozy, decorated with multiple Christmas trees. Thereâ€™s a charging station overlooking the front of the hotel which is nice to people watch at the same time. Thereâ€™s a garden between the hotel & Apple store that is great to take pictures. The hotel is centrally located near shopping, restaurants, cable cars, & China town, just walking distance. Sightseeing tour busses stops at Union Square. Tickets are available at concierge to purchase at discounted price. I could go on and on. This is one of the best hotels we stayed at. I highly recommend Grand Hyatt SF most specially during the holidays. It is just so festive everywhere. Thank you Hyatt! ",29-Dec-17,5
My daughters and I spent Christmas here. We had a great time in the City. Loved it! The hotel however is average to me compared to other grand hyatts. It is though a great location ! Definitely must get a room with a view of Union square or the bay. Otherwise youâ€™ll want to keep the drapes pulled. ,29-Dec-17,3
"Great location!!! Near Union Square, walking distance to public transportation, Westfield Mall, Embarcadero...etc. If you enjoy walking, it's pretty much in the middle everything. From SFO, take the BART and exit Powell and just walk to the hotel. You really don't need a car when you're here. One thing I wish the hotel had was a bar with a view. The bar was on the 2nd floor = no view. Besides a mixed up with my room, it was a good stay. The person who checked me in was helpful. Some rooms in the hotel needs an upgrade. As long as the room and bed is free of bugs and is as clean as can be, I'm happy.",26-Dec-17,4
"We love the Grand Hyatt on Union Square. You can't beat the location. The service is top drawer. We love the Club Room, beautiful view, great food and drink. Jimmy and David the evening attendants are incredible.",25-Dec-17,5
"The hotel has a great location. We had a room with the Union Square view. The view was amazing! The room was very clean and quite. The staff was very friendly. We did self parking for $39 per night, which was challenging. If you don't mind paying about extra $30 per night valet parking probably worth it.",24-Dec-17,5
"Nice clean property. For anyone visiting sf, to me the location is the best, it's right in union square and walking distance to Chinatown. The rooms are on the small side, but very well appointed. My only issues, and they are slight are the lack of hot water, warm water yes, but no hot. The beds were also on the uncomfortable side. Also, it was xmas time and although a couple of xmas trees, it wasn't very festive. Would I stay again, sure, for the right price. ",24-Dec-17,4
"We had has such a wonderful time staying there. The location is perfect, very close to all attractions. DO NOT MISS THE BREAKFAST. That was by far, the best breakfast I ever had in the US. The views were just stunning. Highly recommended hotel.",24-Dec-17,5
"Stayed here for a few days whilst travelling for work. Hotel us well located and is right on Union Square. Food venues were ordinary but the rooms seemed to have been refurbished recently. SF is an expensive city so I guess this place offers reasonable (relative) value for money. If given the choice I would prefer to find a less â€˜big chainâ€™ hotel. In short it did exactly what it said on the box, so nothing to complain about, just nothing to get excited about either. ",24-Dec-17,3
"Updated, clean, and quiet hotel room!! We did not pay the extra for a view, so our room was on a lower level. Not a problem though -Great room if you donâ€™t want to spend the money for a view. It worked great for us. Comfortable bed. Big bathroom. Quiet room which made sleeping perfect. This hotel is very Easy access to union square and a cvs located across the street. We will stay here again. ",23-Dec-17,5
The hotel was beautiful my whole time there we had an overall great experience the food a bit pricey but it is San Francisco and itâ€™s basically close to New York City what were used to staff was amazing ,21-Dec-17,5
"The room they put me in should never have been a room for rent - wedged between a housekeeping closet, elevator & ice closet. Basically, it sounded like jets were taking off from my room every 3-5 min. The lighting in the room is terrible for working (as I needed to do). And, there is a ""nightlight"" that is a strobe light under the nightstand that you cannot turn off without engineering (as I learned the hard way). The location was fine and the staff were very nice, but otherwise I would pick any other hotel besides this for your SF stay. I did get an email apology from the hotel (again showing the good quality staff), but that honestly doesn't make up for how poor my stay was.",20-Dec-17,2
"Back at the Hyatt after a number of years, and much impressed with the upgrade and general appearance of the property. We had an amazing view from the 26th floor, which came at a modest upgrade. Also, right in the middle of this Wonderful City of SF.",19-Dec-17,5
"In the past, Hyatt's in my far-from-limited experience tended to have gorgeous public spaces and only-okay rooms -- the Grand Hyatt New York being a good example. The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco suggests that they've been paying attention. Reception was high tech. Our room was very modern, well appointed, had fridge and microwave, powered shade, extremely comfortable bed with lovely duvet, and a fancy TV system that we didn't use. Food and drink are expensive (as they usually are in this kind of hotel) but we really loved our visit.",19-Dec-17,5
A Christmas stay at the Grand Hyatt is a holiday tradition for us for years. Many rooms at the hotel have incredible views of Union Square and the holiday decorations and festivities. The staff is welcoming and the location can't be beat. This is a San Francisco must-do!,19-Dec-17,5
"Visiting San Fran for 3 nights from Australia. Long standing Hyatt members. Got a higher floor as requested and on our profile but still only 20 out of 36 with no view at all, so no real bonus there! Room is a decent size and supposedly refurbished but the colours and styling are quite dated by at least 10 years!! Ordinary. 3*.There are chips and scratches everywhere with a worn desk chair. The carpets are clean. Bed comfy but small pillows. No throws or cushions anywhere - misleading pictures on the web site - as these make a room more ""homely"" and inviting as well as adding some colour. Hideous, very old fashioned vase in entry blocking the mirror. As the weather in SF is varied maybe a cute coat rack would have been more use?? Had that in our last hotel and thought it a great idea.Makeup area outside of the bathroom is good but needs better lighting. Nice robes. Bathroom basic shower over bath and single vanity but clean. Fridge is useful but not one glass to drink from with only glasses in bathroom! 2 paper cups only so had to keep rinsing!! Horrible plastic blinds - like those placemats you can buy - seriously - never seen anything like them in all my travels! Nice small lobby/seating downstairs with fires.Overall ok just nothing special at all - really not much beeter rooms than a Hyatt house for the money. I feel there are nicer more atmospheric places to stay here. 31/2*",19-Dec-17,3
We stayed on the 5th floor in a double room. Very nice layout and had everything we needed. Hotel staff was excellent. I love this location as it's so close to everything. We typically stay in Nob Hill and it was great to be so much closer. Beautiful hotel - I would definitely recommend staying here. Not a single issue.,19-Dec-17,5
"Room was modern, clean and serene. The pillows were absolutely wonderful - do you sell them? Slept like a baby. Food in the onsite restaurant was excellent. No lines to receive a wonderful, tasty meal. Slight wait at the front desk but not bad. Wished for a better view of San Francisco.",18-Dec-17,5
"This was only my second time visiting San Francisco for leisure, not work. In other words, I was on my own dime. I had stayed at a few of the city's luxury hotels & was looking for something that'd be equally comfortable & reliable (especially since this was my first big trip with my boyfriend & we were traveling cross country) but more reasonably priced.The Grand Hyatt proved to be perfect for our needs. We had an Executive Suite which had a separate living room with a comfy couch, arm chairs, TV & desk in addition to the main bedroom. Best of all, it had 2 full baths. The room, which was at the end of the hall (rm 230_?) was very quiet & clean. The bed was just right & the sheets were nice & soft. While the Hyatt, like all major hotel chains, has adopted environmentally friendly practices, it still has great water pressure in the showers.The hotel staff at check in & check out were very friendly and welcoming. This was more important to me than usual this time because (1) we were arriving at 12:30 AM and (2) this hotel has a ""desk-less"" check-in desk.They were renovating the mezzanine level bar/restaurant area but we weren't impacted by any noise & it appeared they were doing the work at night.A special shout out to Elaine, the concierge, who gave us some great advice & directions for what turned out to be a perfect day of sightseeing.This property will definitely be on my list for future visits to San Francisco.",17-Dec-17,5
"My husband and I really liked the hotel. The room was comfortable, with a lot of space to relax and organize three large luggages. There was a mini fridge at out room, which was very useful. The bathroom was big, clean and nice. The only thing that disappointed me was that there was too much dust in the room and it was visible, on the night stand, on the corners of the carpet, under the bed. It bothered me because I am allergic to dust and I couldâ€™ve beem more comfortable if the room was cleaner.",16-Dec-17,4
Very expensively priced like most US city hotels; No value for money; Late checkout also denied. Not a very hospitable experience for me.So possibly stay at a Airbnb or a lesser priced hotel as this hotel does not offer much. ,15-Dec-17,1
"Can't beat the location. I chose a room overlooking Union Square and WOW! Macy's lights and xmas tree, a festive ice rink and sparkly palm trees. Such a nice way to start the holiday season, even though I was there for business. Convenient Starbucks right across the street. Close to great shopping, including the Apple Store. GREAT Customer service that made things right. Bustling lobby but rooms were peaceful. Would stay again.",15-Dec-17,4
"most accommodating and polite staff. Great location , easy on and off highway 80. Just a few steps from Union Square and other major stores in San Francisco. Gave us an extended stay of two hours after checkout to pack and leave. Not everyone does that.",14-Dec-17,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt, arriving on Thanksgiving and checking out on Saturday. One of the best things about this hotel is the location. Great shopping is only steps away and, if you want to do some touristy things, Chinatown, cable cars and more are nearby. We also had wonderful service during our stay, especially the bellstaff! I would definitely stay here again.",13-Dec-17,5
The hotel staff and location were perfect for our annual girls trip. I would recommend this hotel for any occasion. Some of the staff I have seen year after year when I come. Excellent customer service.,12-Dec-17,5
"Located 1 block from Union Square, this hotel is in an ideal location for get out and about. The hotel itself is nice enough and the staff friendly. The rooms are ok, mattress on the firm side. The thing that dominated our stay and rating was the doors - 2 things - we were at the end of the hall and there were 3 doors withing 2 feet of each other, so everyone coming and going were right outside 2 other rooms, and the noise was very unpleasant. Second, the doors are not soft close doors so every close was a slam and it echoed through our room, as I'm sure it did to the others in their rooms. Late and early door use was frequent and disturbing and kept us awake the first night. We should have complained but were too tired to move rooms. Poor design and consideration of the effects of having the doors so close together.",12-Dec-17,3
The CSM and General Manager at this hotel take their jobs to please high level execs to heart. They made several last minute things happen for my group and I could not have been more pleased with the customer service! Thank you Grand Hyatt SFO!,10-Dec-17,5
Our primary reason for choosing this hotel was location and it didnâ€™t disappoint. This is a well situated hotel for Union Square and all the shops / restaurants and services surrounding it. The hotel is feeling a little dated and could do with a bit of refreshing - but everything was clean and working. There is no â€˜drive-inâ€™ area when you arrive which makes luggage drop off a little bit challenging if itâ€™s busy. The motion activated night lights in the room are too bright at night but otherwise the room was clean and well appointed. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and accommodating. We were on level 27. ,9-Dec-17,4
"Stayed over Black Friday weekend and hotel was crazy busy. We arrived late but our room still wasnâ€™t ready. Staff was very nice and did everything to fix the problem including giving us access to the Club. Club is very small much smaller than in other Hyatts, and food selction was disappointing. Room was nice but we could hear elevator noise. Excellent location, but woukd probably chose another Hyatt next time. ",8-Dec-17,3
"My stay at the Grand Hyatt was awesome. I would highly recommend it for anyone thinking about staying in the Downtown San Francisco area. The location was great, and the staff was phenomenal. Anything that I needed during my stay was taken care of in an urgent and quick manner.",7-Dec-17,5
"Great location, near union square. The Starbucks is just opposite the street. While the room is just ok I think. The cleanness is expected to further improved. Room service is great. The concierge is quite friendly helping me look after the luggage.",6-Dec-17,4
"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel to attend a large conference. I had an upgraded room, but am not sure exactly what was upgraded about the room. Anyway, the room was spacious and well furnished and the bathroom was similarly spacious although it still has an old fashioned tub-shower combination with a shower curtain. The criticism I would have about the room, and the Hotel in general is that once inside the room or the hotel for that matter, there is nothing in the decor, art or otherwise that speaks to the location of the Hotel - the iconic City of San Francisco with the Golden Gate Bridge, Cable Cars, etc.",5-Dec-17,3
"Very nicely located hotel for shopping, events and views of Union Square. Congestion and traffic can be challenging but if your into walking and the weather is nice, the hotel is in a great spot for access by walking to many key spots in the financial, shopping and Embarcadero areas. Parking by valet only and parking fees are high. Very good for adults with nice dinning and bars at the top and lower levels of the hotel. The rooms are updated with awesome bedding and good space.",5-Dec-17,4
Small and smelly rooms. Found hair in the bathtub and pubic hairs on the restroom floor. Requested a fan and I was only brought a small fan that did not blow air. Requested another fan and I was informed that the hotel only had 2 fans!!!,5-Dec-17,3
"Perfect location in the center of everything with easy access to all manner of public transportation and public parking across the street. Very clean and modern rooms and common areas. Slightly more expensive than the older, dingier hotels nearby, but well worth the extra $25. Highly recommended for a great SF stay.",2-Dec-17,5
Terrific view and location. Beds were too hard. Only one chair in the room. No local newspapers. Had to go into the lobby to do any reading. Don't know if I would stay there again until the beds are better. Told they were getting pillowtop bed shortly.,2-Dec-17,4
"We loved our stay at the Hyatt SF. First of all, we had an amazing view of the Bay Bridge and the city. Breakfast was good, location was perfect. We walked to the Ferry Bldg, only a few blocks away. Our room was comfortable, clean and warm. Even though remodeling was taking place, our room was quiet.",1-Dec-17,5
You cannot find a better place to stay in SF. They make every effort to make sure you are taken care of. The staff is amazing and the location is perfect. The food is very good. We love the fact that they know they are there for you and they make you feel like that.,1-Dec-17,5
"Stayed for 2 nights in a club level room around Thanksgiving holiday. Upgraded to club level with points, which I felt was a great value for my family. Club level provided some very nice views both in the room and in the club. Breakfast and afternoon snack options were good, and it was great to have a place to go back to after a long day of walking to havr a drink and relax. Service was excellent on all levels- front desk allowed early check in, accomodated rooms that were near each other for my family, and all staff were professional, friendly, and courteous. My only complaint is that you could hear the elevator from the room, so not great if you are a light sleeper. Bathroom also has a pocket door which provides more space, but removes privacy- especially since the pocket door did not close all the way. Agree with others that for parking, use the valet lot across the street (next to CVS), or there is also a self park deck across the street as well. All in all, it was an excellent stay and I would certainly select this property again.",30-Nov-17,5
"Another good stay at the Hyatt in a somewhat noisy but convenient location..near good restaurants and museums as well as Chinatown and in a positive way, excellent Curry at the Taj Campton across the street.",30-Nov-17,5
"Great location and friendly staff here. Wife and I took a weekend trip and researched over 15 hotels and ultimately chose this one. Very satisfied with the choice. We felt safe here and liked the vibe and feel of the property. Room didn't have that great of a view, but luck of the draw I guess. Rooms could use a big mirror too when getting ready. Otherwise, great place and comfy. Check out the bar on the 2nd floor too. Prime location in Union Square.",30-Nov-17,4
Bring earplugs. I was told by reservations that over 90% of the rooms in this hotel have connecting doors to other rooms. I was unlucky. My next door neighbors were noisy. Next time I insisted on a non-connecting room. I got it but this time it was the elevator noise that did no let me sleep. Sad since the service provided by the staff is good. ,30-Nov-17,2
"Stayed there for 2 nights in late November for a Christmas visit to San Francisco. My room was on the 25th floor with a stunning view of the city with the bay beyond. Every employee, from the doorman and parking valet to the check-in clerk and bellman was the perfect mix of friendly and polite. The room was clean and modern. The lighting in the bathroom was the best of any hotel I've experienced. Also appreciated the nightstand motion sensors that turned on floor lights in the dark, plentiful outlets for recharging devices, and the bedside switch for the windowshade. I will definitely stay here in the future.",29-Nov-17,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for three nights over the Thankgiving weekend. High marks for the friendly and helpful staff, nice room with a east view, great bed and pillows and breakfast (included in our room rate). Our room needed a large mirror - the only one was in the bathroom. The Union Sqaure location puts you in the heart of The City. One criticism: the elevators are really slow, especully if you want to go to the mezzanine restaurant and bar.",28-Nov-17,4
"I travelled many times to San Francisco and I really enjoyed this hotel and the location of it , it was in union square which all the shopping stores and cafes around you . The lobby was great and has lovely couches and fire area around , the rooms were very clean and has great views . The sizes of the rooms were great and comfortable, ",28-Nov-17,4
"Not well managed, very crowded, club room is a free for all, not a luxury experience. Location is good but will book at marriott next time, just not worth it. Hyatt rewards program is not as strong as its competitors. ",28-Nov-17,2
Everyone at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco was very nice and accommodating. I would stay there again when I am in SF. Rooms were clean. The elevators were a little slow. Conceige room was somewhat crowded however the staff was very responsive,28-Nov-17,5
Small roomsNo microwave No free parking at the hotel - you have to park at a walking distance and itâ€™s expensive otherwise you take the valet parking for double the price of the hotel parking. So nervous that they have not mentioned that at the website neither the operator told me. ,28-Nov-17,4
"Apple flagship store is next door; beautiful. A small park between the hotel & store. Easy walk up Grant to Chinatown. Easy walk to restaurants. Convenient for grandma & grandchildren, parents. Clean. Well appointed. Used the Concierge, doormen, car service; late night dining; everything worked. ",27-Nov-17,4
"Located in the heart of San Francisco, great especially if you donâ€™t have a car. Nice high-rise building, nice rooms (though the lovel floors can get pretty noisy due to traffic & people in the streets). Reception is somewhat weird (floating desks with Macs) and staff could definitely be more friendly. ",26-Nov-17,4
"We have been visiting San Francisco for over 26 years as my husband was born here. We moved to Ashland Oregon and need our city fix as Iï¸è am originally from NYC. We have traveled the world and though we are realistic we do know that we love great customer service. We stayed at a few hotels around Union Square and though we enjoyed them the customer service wasnâ€™t what we expected. We compromised thinking this is the new normal. Iï¸è finally suggested we try Grand Hyatt and we were blown away in every direction from reception, room service, bar, business office and more. Iï¸è personally want to thankAnthony Flores and Steve Reyes for taking care of our personal and important business needs. We stay in the city at least 5 times a year bringing family at times with us. Iï¸è am so happy we found a new home. Thank you all for superior customer service. The service is a 10!!!",25-Nov-17,5
"As a family of four with two young children we stayed in a room with two double beds, had a great view of the city (25th floor) and bay during a short short city break in SF. The hotel is perfectly situated for walking to the various sites and great for local restaurants. The staff were friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome. ",25-Nov-17,4
"Great location centrally located in the heart of all the Awesome shopping San Francisco has to offer. Many Great restaurants near by. The Hotel was clean, staff was friendly. I was impressed with the light feature under the night stand. My second time here, will return soon",25-Nov-17,5
"Over-all solid. Facilities are starting to feel dated. Check in kiosks are awkward. Doormen, valet, and concierge were excellent. The view from the treadmill and elliptical machines in the very clean and well equipped workout facility will inspire you to workout longer and come back again. Wish the top floor restaurant/lounge was open for business other than conventions. Would really appreciate a jacuzzi",25-Nov-17,5
"San Francisco was a sadly experience. City is completely dirty, huge homeless problem. Me and my family didnâ€™t feel safe in the hotel area and proximity. Drug addicted is in every were and the city is smelling drug and dirty. Very sad to see. I regret been there. ",23-Nov-17,4
"If you are looking for a comfortable hotel in a prime location of Union Square, the Grand Hyatt hotel is perfect for you. The check-in and out process is very smooth, drive up to the curb and you will be in your room in less than 10 minutes. The excellence of my previous trip was dwarfed by the lack of concern for guests (elevator malfunction, noisy neighbors, misleading room description), but I hope you will give Grand Hyatt a chance and receive more excellent service than I did. Be sure to confirm you have a view of Union Square (ice rink) prior to booking, and request to speak to a manager should you have any issues with your accommodations.",22-Nov-17,4
"I had a very good experience, Service quality was very good, and They are a very good variety of Breakfast.I recommend this place to everyone.Location was awesome.I stayed there 15 nights and I am very happy with the service.",22-Nov-17,5
This is my favorite Union Square hotel location. Definitely like the convenience of the club floor rooms. Breakfast is good and the view is great. The staff are very customer oriented which makes you feel very welcome here.,21-Nov-17,5
"The people working at the Grand Hyatt took pride in their job and looked like they were having fun helping people. That is what makes this place feel like home. Get a floor higher up to avoid the traffic and city noises closer to ground level. A south facing room will have a view of Union Square and the ice skating rink around Christmas time. Parking is expensive at $39/night which is across the street and it is not self-parking but still valet. Plan on about 5-10 minutes to get your car from leaving the hotel. This hotel has plenty of outlets to charge laptops, phones and other gadgets. Great for families.",19-Nov-17,5
"A 3 night business stay in San Francisco at the Grand Hyatt was great. Check in, room service and porter service all friendly and efficient. Room was large and clean with very comfortable bed. Gym was well equipped with a fantastic view !",19-Nov-17,5
"The review about the Grand Hyatt SF is mixed. Once a jewel among the business hotels in SF, lost its upper scale status as a business hotel. The service - as usual at Hyatt properties - attentive, friendly and welcoming. Sleep quality â€“ excellent. The hotel grounds are modern and well maintained. The gym is great with modern equipment.That said, the rooms are on the downside: even the ones on the higher floors: no central switch for lighting, not enough light on the working desk to work with a laptop, the desk chair torn and uncomfortable, and decoration start to age. Since I value quality of service over quality of rooms, my overall score is 4 stars, but for that high rate per night, the rooms are no more than an average 3 stars.",18-Nov-17,4
"Excellent location, staff and value; the best hotel in San Francisco for business and pleasure! I have used this hotel for over eight years for both business and private functions and have never had an issue.",18-Nov-17,5
"I normally stay in a Marriott but there was a really good deal on rooms going at this Hyatt (almost half price). We were given a room on the 4th floor 'the highest floor of the standard rooms' according to the check in person. We could have been on the ground floor with the windows open with the amount of street noise. We could distinctly hear words in conversations as people walked past the hotel and the number of hot rod cars which zoomed past the hotel. My last memory is of one of the valets, who stood there watching us struggle with our suitcases to get the door open to exit the hotel (all of the door attendants were busy with other people) and didn't move until I gave him a really nasty look. Not what I would expect from a Hyatt at all. I'll continue to stay at Marriotts in the future!",17-Nov-17,3
"I have been to quite a few hotels in San Francisco. I have to say that this is one of the best ones. While large, it has captured a boutique style. The lobby is inviting and the staff approachable. I also really like its location. I can easily walk to Union Square as well as to Chinatown. The Apple Store is next door, and my sesame buns, the other direction, through the tunnel. My hotel room was modern, clean, and well appointed. I have no complaints. I'm sold. Hyatt knows the product and delivers it.",15-Nov-17,5
I will always remember how caring and wonderful the staff was to me during my emergency evacuation from the Sonoma Wildfires. It made it so much easier to have compassionate staff all around me during the months I needed to stay here. The only drawback is the noise of the construction around Union Square since my room faces that direction.,14-Nov-17,4
"Conveniently located and elegantly decorated, this Hyatt is a great place to stay when you want to visit SF for a day. It's central and accessible to everything - boutique shopping or in Westfield, enjoying a pastry and coffee on Union Square, nerd-ing in Apple Store, lots and lots of cuisine choices around the neighborhood. Let me not forget to mention the impeccable rooms and hospitality Hyatt is well-known for!",12-Nov-17,5
"Enjoyed our stay here while at a conference. Room very comfortable with the latest technology including being able to stream my Netflix shows live to the room tv! Close to lots of great shots, restaurants and attractions. Great customer service. ",12-Nov-17,4
"Upgraded me to a room with a beautiful view, remembered my name everytime I called front desk, provided prompt and fast service. All in all, amazing experience. Will try to stay here every time I come to SF.",12-Nov-17,5
I had room 3019 in front of the square. Noise reduction was very bad and I heard all traffi and city work noises during the night. It was impossible to sleep without earplugs. This ruined my all stay. That is a shame as I specifically asked for a quiet room and was confirmed the room would be very quiet.,12-Nov-17,2
"We enjoyed our stay here. The bed was great and the roller blinds were good. The foot sensors by the bed were handy at night as the blinds make the room pitch black. Elevators are fast and the wifi is very quick. Only negatives was the slight gap under the door so we could hear the ice machine nearby at all hours, and our shower pressure was not ideal. We didnâ€™t eat there, $32 per person for a buffet breakfast is not cool. Great location and lovely staff.",11-Nov-17,4
We booked a harbour view room which was on the 30th floor. Great views but known for the foggy city it was often hard to enjoy the views. The room had two double beds but for the price I think two queens would be more realistic.. Location was fantastic and perfect to enjoy restaurants and shopping. We travelled with our 10 year old and great room service for kids if after a long day they are fussy. Rooms were clean and big big tv in the room was nice. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to everyone. I used the concierge and they were very helpful with sightseeing tips. We enjoyed looking at the pumpkin carvings made by the staff for Halloween. Thanks for a wonderful stay. ,9-Nov-17,5
This trip we were upgraded and wow... what a room! 33rd floor with incredible view and beautifully done spacious suite.Steven Reyes went beyond the call of dutyto make as feel like royalty!The location canâ€™t be beat and the recent remodel is to die for.Lobby is super inviting and hip.I highly recommend the property for a stay in San Francisco!!,9-Nov-17,4
"Extremely average hotel. The hotel is in a great location, right next to Union Square, where the Macy building it. Only a 10 minute drive from the piers. Location wise, it's great. The customer service was good, they were friendly and wanted to help, and the hotel looked nice, it was kept up well, but that's about where it stopped for us. We payed 80 dollars extra a night for the Grand Club. Not worth it. Take your 80 dollars and eat out. The food is below average, the staff did not seem knowledgeable, and there was extremely limited variety. The room was pretty dirty when we checked in as well. There were hairs in the shower, stains on one of our pillow cases, things left in the cupboards from previous guest, and soap scum left on the shower door.",8-Nov-17,3
"We had a week long event at the Grand Hyatt SF. The team effort that pulled our event together was fantastic. They were easy to reach in multiple different ways email, conf. app or by phone. As soon as we placed a request they deliverer quickly. Even with the last minute requests we had they still accommodated us and did so with a smile and compassion. Everyone at our event raved about the food and this comes from a health conscious group. Thank you Grand Hyatt staff for making our event such a great success.",8-Nov-17,5
We had a wonderful time at this hotel. The location is great. You are close to everything. Check in was flawless. Our room was a great size. It provided everything we needed. It was also spotless. Every employee was there with a smile to help whenever needed.,7-Nov-17,5
Came to stay in San Francisco during Dreamforce and really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I've been to quite a few hotels in this city and this has been the most enjoyable. Right from the online check-in through to on-line check-out everything was a pleasure in this hotel.,6-Nov-17,5
"Great location, comfortable rooms, loads of space & very friendly & helpful staff. Just a tad pricey, but then everything in SAN Francisco is, just market rates really.Conveniently right next to the Apple store . Great Starbucks across the road for brekkie.",6-Nov-17,4
Probably one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at in a long time. As a tech person I loved all the high tech room features. Hyatt club was great with good food. Really enjoyed my time there. Staff was super friendly and welcoming.,6-Nov-17,5
"Spent 6 nights at the Hyatt as our headquarters for our vacation in San Francisco. Great staff, comfortable modern rooms in a great location for sight seeing. The price was fine and could even park our car for what I thought was reasonable just around the corner.",6-Nov-17,5
"Im traveling from indonesia and stay 1 night in 3 room with friends in this hotel, the moment i got there the lobby and the receiptionist is very nice althought we are confuse cause the receiption is not like any other receiptionist desk, its only 4 imac with 5 people standing in front of it. The room is ok with electronic shade window but we are put only in 4th floor soo theres nothing to see in the window and the information from the receiptionist in the lobby not to clear regarding whereâ€™s the breakfast what i get if i stay here or is there any restaurant in the hotel for dinner or lunch. Soo not what i expected in grand hyatt sf",5-Nov-17,3
"Been a few years since I stayed here; it is vastly improved, with a nice contemporary renovation. Room was huge, with a nice view over Union Square. I particularly like the discreet and automatic night light that turns on if you step out of bed in the night - handy feature. Room is clean, but unfortunately, walls are very thin, so you can hear much of what goes on in the rooms next to you. Housekeeping staff are very friendly. Hyatt's much-talked-about app-based mobile key doesn't work.Valet parking is, however, massively overpriced.",3-Nov-17,4
Stayed there for a couple nights. The concierge was really helpful to organize our daily trips into San Francisco. Did not try the food outlet but had a drink at the bar and was not disappointed. My high floor request was respected and offered a nice view overlooking the streets.,2-Nov-17,5
"Have been staying at Grand Hyatt in San Francisco over many years. I have to be in San Fran for business and usually arrive worn and tired from New York. Every single visit - I am greated by a smiling face - my room is in perfect condition, everyone working there is super helpful and just seems happy. It can not be easy for a big hotel chain to maintain this type of consistent performance! They are for sure doing everything right! ",2-Nov-17,5
"Did I say perfect lol 3 nights this week on business 27th floor over looking Union Square.Room had added extras that I do not normally see!Electric window blinds Torch in draw Huge sink in bathroom my favorite was the motion detector night light, its a very faded blue beam that comes on under the bedside table, so when you get up in the night the light comes on enough to see but not blast you awake.My view was amazing room was spacious and clean. I requested a Microwave (No extra charge) always a plus to heat something up if need be.Valet guys are AWESOME super friendly. Parking is $69.95 a night BUT if you go around the back of the hotel the parking garage with a Valet is $39.95 a night for hotel guests.See you again soon you just became my favorite hotel in San Francisco.Thank you SR",2-Nov-17,5
"We stayed for 5 nights to explore SAN FRANCISCO after our son wedding: The hotel its located very conveniently in the heart of the city, but for the price and renown , was less than expected ;kind of rundown and lack of expected amenities , like pool and steam room.The staff was very good for the most part. So overall , we were disappointed.",31-Oct-17,3
"this hotel is very centrally located and is affordable. Always nice and clean. Bed & pillows are ok but not great. Staff is very friendly. Bar makes great drinks. Views of Union Square are wonderful, Bay view is another option.",31-Oct-17,3
We always leave smiling after our short visits. Great downtown location along with fine rooms and service. We opted for club level this time to enjoy easy access to food and views. We recommend asking about the assigned room so you are aware of what your going to get before you open the door into the room. We would like to see improved security for access to floors with guest rooms by requiring a coded key to move the elevators or staff person asking to show your card key. Good value. ,30-Oct-17,5
"Lovely hotel, great food and atmosphere but room 507 was extremely noisy with street noise and room fan. The higher up I would assume the more quiet. Please avoid rooms facing Sutter, adjacent building had roof equipment that created noise all night.",30-Oct-17,4
"We started out at one hotel that was in a terrible part of town, with a very unsafe environment inside and out. We immediately started making phone calls and came across the Grand Hyatt. The staff were amazing, they went beyond to help us with our transition over to their hotel. When we arrived it was a breath of fresh air! We felt extremely safe, staff very friendly and the rooms were very clean and relaxing. Would highly recommend.",29-Oct-17,5
Great experience from the moment I checked in to the guest room. Very cool sensor lights on floor when you stepped out of bed. Rooms were very comfortable and overall lighting was very nice. Usually hotel rooms are very dark.,26-Oct-17,5
Good stay at this quality hotel in union square convenient to many locations right next to apps store and Starbucks shopping also good parking options........... until next time time... Great views on 36th floor ,25-Oct-17,5
Very helpful staff from the second you pull up to the curb. Room was clean (except windows but it's SF) Nice bathrooms with good water pressure. Uber is easy to catch or a cab. We have stayed a few times and would stay again,24-Oct-17,4
"Hotel is conveniently located by Union Square. Adjacent to CVS, Apple, Starbucks and Nike Stores. Friendly staff, clean and bright room. Our bright room overlooks Union Square and the south Bay. Public self parking across street at Sutter/Stockton garage. Free EV chargers available in basement.",24-Oct-17,5
"This hotel is located in the center of everything, and if you treat yourself to a city view, it's fantastic. The rooms are very nice - well-decorated to look mid-century, but with a modern feel. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are always clean. The staff will treat you well, too. If you're looking for a great place in the city, this is it!",23-Oct-17,5
"I've stayed in other hotels at lower rates that provided better in room amenities. Such as welcoming message with water bottles, an in room safe, snack basket, and better room presentation. This didn't have that. Plus the shared room doors have little insulation, so sound easily travels through. Staff was limited in greetings. Nothing special about this hotel.",23-Oct-17,3
"fast checkin. great location. great views (we were facing Union Square). The rooms don:t have a lot of room for luggage, and the double beds are doubles, not queens, so small. The bar is nice, but pricey, as is valet parking. But you are right in San Francisco so we expected that. No in room coffee, you will have to venture downstairs for morning coffee.",22-Oct-17,4
"The hotel location is perfect. On the Union square, next to Apple store. Walking distance to most restaurants, shopping areas and sight seeing. The room was comfortable though it wasnâ€™t as big as I used to have in USA. The problem was with the noise coming from outside early in the morning or in the middle of the night. It is a side effect of being in the middle of the city. Also the elevators were always full. ",21-Oct-17,4
This is a Hyatt that has kept up with the style and function of upscale living. They staff is very friendly and will personally take care of your questions. Nice to see that they are first class still.,21-Oct-17,5
"Staff at hotel is very courteous and professional. Check in and out were very quick. We encountered the doormen the most since we were in and out a lot and they were very nice. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, the room and bathroom were a good size, and there was a handy table and mirror outside of the bathroom to get ready at in case the bathroom was occupied. The a/c worked well - didn't have any problems adjusting it. There are mechanical shades that did a great job of keeping out the light (and you can adjust them from bed). Plenty of electrical outlets to charge the gadgets. This is the first time staying in a hotel in the city where I was not awakened by street noise. It could have been the location of the room (we didn't have much of a view) or the quality of their windows... not sure, but I've stayed in several other hotels in SF, and this is the very time I did not hear car noise, street sweepers, or people yelling. Location of hotel is walking distance to many things and it's easy to catch a Lyft or Uber out front since the hotel is right on the corner. They also seemed to have security out front at night.",20-Oct-17,4
"On paper a 5 star hotel but travelling with a group of 7 almost everyone had experienced issues with the hotel over a two night stayNoise transfer between rooms , rattling windows , room lights not working and losing s booking for s guest for 1 night. Lots of positives, but at this price point should be better",20-Oct-17,3
"Great location for bringing family on your business trip. They will find plenty of sites, shopping, China town and tours within a block. Union square is right outside with many activities including an ice rink during winter. The location is what makes it. The hotel lobby is bustling with people and the rooms what you would expect. The dining is ok but with all the great restaurants so close, no need to eat here unless you just don't want to go out.",20-Oct-17,4
"We stayed in a great room with a view of the bay.The hotel was within walking distance of Chinatown, big bus tours and shopping! The hotel's bar had decent drinks, however the restaurant offered a great breakfast. Two small problems, no towel racks in the bathroom and only a pocket door closure in the bathroom that didn't always fully close.",19-Oct-17,4
"We travel for work a lot and after a week of boutique hotels around California, we were glad to be on familiar territory- a business hotel. All your typical luxuries of a good bed, amenities and an efficient service from check in to check out. What we found to be lacking was a central switch to turn on the lights in the room. Each light had to be individually turned on. A bit of a pain at night. Otherwise you'll be sure to get your regular business comfort in this hotel. ",19-Oct-17,4
"Stayed here for 6 nights whilst attending a conference. Lovely hotel in a good location. Almost on union square, easy walk to shopping areas and only 10 mins to Moscone centre. Rooms were large, clean and the gym on the 35th floor provided great views as you worked out. Overall a great stay.",17-Oct-17,5
Great hotel and location which got spoilt by arrogant staff. Obviously poor management who are not aware of ground level performance. I would have given this a 100% rating if it werent for a few staff members.,17-Oct-17,3
"great location, comfort, and quality hotel. The hotel is practically located at Union square which is close to the main scene. The rooms are holistically designed and positioned so that sleep quality is at its best.",16-Oct-17,4
"Family of four stayed here for three nights during our CA vacation. Room was small with two double beds, but typical for San Fran hotels. Nice room and view was great even from lower floors. Convenient to Starbucks, public transportation, etc. Did not use the restaurants in the hotel, too pricey. Service very good. We requested QUIET floor and indeed got it. This was one of the only hotel stays in years I can say I did not hear floor noise and/or door opening and closing.",14-Oct-17,4
The location of the Hyatt Grand Regency is superb. I was walking distance to everything. The hotel staff is very accommodating and attentive. The food in the One Up restaurant is consistently good and the service is excellent day or night.,13-Oct-17,5
"Our stay was for 2 days and without question, the service at the front desk, the interaction with concierge was welcoming, pleasant, and professional. Professional not in the sense that responses were robotic and routine, but with a personalization that made you feel welcome. Aside from the great interaction with staff, this hotel is well located in the heart of San Francisco, just a stones throw from Union Square and walking distance to hundreds of restaurants, China Town, and lots of shopping. From Powell street which was one street over, you can catch the street trolley to Fisherman's Warf which takes 15 minutes (you can buy tickets $7/person each way at Walgreens on Powell). Back to the room, it was current and had comfortable bedding and pillows. Overall, we couldn't of expected anything more from this hotel and would definitely recommend.",12-Oct-17,5
"Very attentive staff, quiet rooms, comfortable beds. We stayed on one of the club floors. Club rooms include access to the Club Lounge for breakfast, appetizers in the late afternoon and desserts in the evening. We only used the lounge for breakfast because we were out of the hotel most of the day. The Lounge was on an upper floor with an amazing view of the city.",11-Oct-17,5
"It's beside Apple which is location in the heart of San Francisco, between the shops and the big buses trips and the rooms is clean and big enough but the staff is not really helpful and you will find some difficultly to deal with them , they need to enhace their way and unify their respone since some of them replies totally different from his colleagues, the price is a bit high , the wifi there is amazing , the hotel is excellent",11-Oct-17,3
"I recommended the hotel to my friends coming from Brazil. Everything went smooth, the had a great stay! Hotel is super well located, great service, super clean'. For the shopper crowed it is perfect, right next to good shops, Macy's, Newman Marcus, Saks, close to the Westfield Mall and Powell St. lots of good restaurants in the area, as well as art galleries, SF Moma, Contemporary Jewish Museum and Yerba Buena Art Center....",11-Oct-17,5
"very convenient place to stay. near the tourists spots and a lot of restaurants around the place. When it comes to the room. We stayed in a deluxe room. It was pretty standard and basic. The service was nice. overall, it was a good place to stay for tourist who would like to go around places.",11-Oct-17,3
"I'm thoroughly disappointed with the housekeeping attendant we have attending to room 1114 in the morning shift. Firstly she cannot comprehend English so simple requests like come back after a certain time lapse is disregarded. The last straw was after asking her to come back after an hour she proceeded to advice me that her shift finishes at 3 so it will be the late shift who will clean then deliberately implied for me to rush my departure so she can do the rm before her shift finishes. She even peered inside the room looking above my head to see the inside of the rm. I've never had such a rude, unprofessional, abrasive attendant. Begs the question as to why she was forcing a clean perhaps due to the tip quantity she wants to meet everyday. I told her I'll just call front desk to advise when I want the rm cleaned. She is also so miserable there is no courtesy, no pleasantries & has a sad energy about her. The hskp delivery person who gave us plates & cutlery we requested on Thursday oct 5 (evening) had knocked twice 5 seconds apart and left within 30 seconds so by the time we arose from bed to attend to the door he had vanished. Shortly after guest services request called to ask where we were & I explained he vanished abruptly. When the guy did come back I've never met a more apathetic older man who literally scorned when he gave the plates as if we had ruined his entire night by making him wait longer than his allocated 30 second wait. This is pathetic. Service like this is expected from a motel not a 4/5 star hotel that cost $360usd/night. What is with this missing must haves - why aren't majority of this automatically available in the room upon check in & replenished accordingly like all other hotels? This projects such a cheap approach to service provision. In addition in America where tips are necessary. means every request is matched by a tip so essentially you end up paying for the must haves again via tipping. Perhaps this notion has been overlooked in the implementation of this system. I'd suggest indicating on the card that tip is not necessary when requesting additional/multiple must haves. Overall a below satisfactory experience so far in grand Hyatt San Francisco. Only consolation Front desk - helpful & courteous. Hskp & room attendants are a disaster definitely not worth tipping. No service, no smile, no communication skills, not professional.",11-Oct-17,2
"We really enjoyed our 3-night stay at the Grand Hyatt. The main advantage is the location which is perfect, just off Union Square. The room was good, nothing special but very comfortable.Important to know that it's very expensive. In addition to the price, there are 4 (!) different taxes added so it ends up more than we'd thought.Staff were very good.Breakfast was exorbitant so we just went to Starbucks across the street.",10-Oct-17,5
"For the price I paid for this hotel during Oracle OpenWorld 2017, the Grand Hyatt San Francisco was not worth it. Might as well stay at Motel 6. Room was small with crappy Internet speed. Do yourself a favor. Find another hotel.",9-Oct-17,2
"The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco is a modern, beautiful hotel with old fashion customer service that is so rare these days. From the moment you stop your car you are greeted from the staff outside, to the doorman , to check in. It is all that you expect from Hyatt and more. They make it look easy, which means they have worked extra hard. I highly recommend staying at the Hyatt when visiting San Francisco.",9-Oct-17,5
"What a delight to sleep in a comfortable bed in a quiet room in a location next to Union square. They also have an excellent fitness center with a killer view. I didn't eat at their restaurant, but did attend a three day conference, which was well handled, efficiently and courteously. Even the elevators come quickly. You won't be disappointed here. It's not a romantic resort, but for business this hotel gets the job done.",8-Oct-17,4
"Great hotel, very clean and service was the best with knowledgeable staff. Would highly recommend with a geat room, convenient to everything in the San Francisco area. Located in the safe part of town, convenient to parking.",8-Oct-17,5
"Wonderful property with excellent location. Hotel was in great condition. Very well kept. Staff takes great pride. The only disappointment was the room. Decor is very dated. Based on the room price paid, expected much more. ",8-Oct-17,4
"We had a nice room with access to the grand club launch on the 32th floor. The room was very nice, generous space, wonderful beds, well serviced, good bathroom products.The grand club launch was great, nice breakfast, every day different hors d'oeuvres dishes, free soft drinks and inexpensive alcoholic drinks. Exceptionally nice and friendly staff everywhere (especially in the club launch). We had a wonderful stay (8 nights) and will definitively come back.",7-Oct-17,5
"Stayed here for 2 nights (Fri and Sat) for a conference being held at the hotel. Hotel is in a great area, right next to the Apple Store Union Square. Good overnight parking in the Stockton Sutter Garage ($36 all day flat rate) right across the street. McDonalds and Starbucks within 100 feet of the hotel. Hotel is always really busy and there are always people in the lobby floor. Room was on the smaller side, but was clean, and bed was firm. Powered window shades that can be controlled from the bed was a nice touch. Bathroom had a very long sink. While it looks nice its not very functional (doesn't have a sink stop to collect water) and it makes the available counter space very limited. Free WiFi was faster than any that I've used at Hilton properties. Didn't try any food from the hotel restaurant because there are plenty of good restaurants around Union Square. Hotel also has a nice card that lists all the stuff you can get from the hotel that you fought to bring (like a razor, comb, cotton balls, etc.) which is a nice touch.Negatives is that I checked in at 10:00 pm Friday night and had to wait 30 minutes before I was checked in. There were a lot of foreign travelers that were each taking a long time to check-in despite there were 3 hotel employees working (although there are 5 available check-in locations). If I was the manager and saw such a long line of waiting line of obviously tired guests, I would have opened all 5 check-in computers and/or had a separate line for guests who already had confirmed reservations because it only takes a 1 minute to check in those guests (like myself). The AC in my room always seemed to be running when I set it to AUTO (it doesn't reach the desire temperature and then stop like it should). The noise didn't bother me but might be an issue for light sleepers.Overall, I would stay at this hotel again based on its location and comfortable, clean room.",7-Oct-17,4
the hotel the location and the service was excellent. The staff are very friendly. The room was so comfortable and neat. close to the picture in the website. I recommend city view it was amaizing. the map provided concierge was useful.,7-Oct-17,5
"San Francisco was completely booked for a series of conventions during a time I needed to conduct business around Union Square in The City. I was fortunate to catch a room at the Grand Hyatt Union Square and had an amazing experience. From Gilizi and Steve at the front desk to Liz at the concierge desk, I felt like a VIP even though this was my first visit to this property. The room was very comfortable and quite. I upgraded to the Grand Club level to be able to use the Grand Club on the 32nd floor (staff and food offering was exceptional). I am in the retail industry and I greatly appreciate being made to feel like a welcomed visitor.",6-Oct-17,5
"Helpful online check in, immediate text response to questions or requests . Good location, friendly staff and comfortable room. Hyatt member benefits were notable..... expedited check in, early and late check in/out, free in room internet and bottled water at check in.",5-Oct-17,5
"We arrived late due to plane delays and still our check in was a breeze. Very friendly courteous young lady put us at ease right away even at midnight. The location of this hotel is key, it's located right next to Union Square, tons of shopping and restaurants. Check out Lori's Diner go early to avoid a wait or before bars empty out. I even tried out the hotels gym one early morning, saw the sunrise over the city. More equipment than your usual hotel so give it a try. What a view!Our room was clean and quiet. Although there were some revelers around 2AM getting off the elevator. They carried a loud conversation for close to 5 minutes until we yelled out our door to shut up and go to bed. That seemed to have done the trick! :) The long hallway that the elevators empty out is all tiled so sound carries. The hotel does have signs up about quiet timeframes and to be mindful and respectful. Although my guess is when you're drunk and coming back to your hotel at 2AM the last thing you do is be mindful and courteous. :)The wait on elevators took quite sometime but considering it's a large hotel in the city I guess that's to be expected. Several times we had to wait for another elevator as they were just too full. Very busy hotel so if you are looking for something more quaint or quiet this hotel may not be your first choice. I however had a nice stay as it was close to everything.",4-Oct-17,4
"First off, the hotel amenities are great. But, while we stayed we had people yelling next door, a basketball team staying there, etc. The one thing is that the cleaners threw out personal items that where worth hundreds of dollars. No accountability, no help from staff. They said they will look into it, but nothing. Nothing stolen just thrown out. A dental appliance is not garbage. ",4-Oct-17,3
"Stayed in a King Club Room that offered breakfast, all day coffee/latte's, and evening snacks. The room was a nice size and the bed was super comfortable but we felt that it could have been cleaner for the price of $550 CDN per night. It was in the heart of Union Square and within walking distance to just about everything we wanted to see. Great shopping, restaurants, and sight seeing. I would recommend eating at The Session in Presidio. Amazing food and on the way to the Golden Gate Bridge.",4-Oct-17,4
"Beautiful suite on the large bedroomfloor of the Grand Hyatt San /pantry Francisco. Large open floor plan with 2 seperate keyed entrances, , half guest bathroom and huge marble master bathroom with an enormous shower.",4-Oct-17,4
This Hotel is a Jewel > > i want to keep it to myself. Pleasant & Helpful staff / Location to Union Square & downtown and up to Nob/Russian Hill . Good restaurants all around . A Lovely Hotel !! Will stay here more often !,4-Oct-17,5
"This hotel comes at a premium in a premium location w average service and indifferent service. Perhaps we expected too much, but they only met the lowest of expectations. Seriously eat breakfast elsewhere. Bland food and high prices w indifferent service....",3-Oct-17,2
"Clean, comfortable room with efficient check-in and check-out. Friendly, courteous staff. Fitness room felt a bit cramped but had sufficient number of cardio and resistance machines as well as free weights. Excellent location near Union Square. Overall, enjoyed the stay.",3-Oct-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco Hotel staff was very attentive, the hotel was in great condition and all leisure needs and shopping are convenient in the Union Square area of San Francisco. I would stay again when visit the city.",2-Oct-17,5
"Stayed in 2015 and repeat stay in 2017 because I like the great location and the room is of good size. At USD325 plus taxes a night, it ainâ€™t exactly cheap but it is lacking of essential toiletries. To be fair it could be the case of hotels in US. Maybe I have been to pampered with hotels in Singapore, toothbrush and toothpaste, comb, shower cap, bottled water are basic items. These are non existence. Be the disrupters by providing these items to differentiate yourself. ",1-Oct-17,4
"Stayed 2 nights in room 319. If you put the temperature to where it's just right, plan to be scalded and alternately lukewarm. If you put the temperature a bit less hot than you want, you won't be scalded, but you will have parts of your shower being cold. Don't know if it's just this room or the whole hotel. Anyway, beware. ",1-Oct-17,2
This hotel was simply beautiful inside. The art work was very inspirational. Everyone was very nice. Our room included the lounge which was a nice touch to our trip everyday we were able to eat breakfast hors dâ€™oeuvers and desserts and it was a full breakfast and the hors dâ€™ oeuvres were like a full dinner and the desserts were very tasteful it was a nice surprise and well worth-staying in the room that provides this I would highly recommend this room. The only downside was the room was a little small but not bad for a couple. The view was amazing especially at night with all the lights of the city. Very reasonable price for all the amenities that we had. In the lobby there is beautiful artwork and 2 beautiful fireplaces. They also have a variety of restaurants and a bar. It is also kid friendly if you bring your children along. It is close to shopping and all the tour spots around San Francisco. Would highly recommend staying at this location. ,1-Oct-17,5
So glad we decided to stay here for location & views. We stayed Club level and really enjoyed the access to lounge. Great variety of food and nice service. Travel a lot and appreciate convenience to get coffee and breakfast first thing without having to decide where to go. Nice to have this option for evening also.We used the hotel self park across street. Convenient with in/out privileges.Glad you could crack door a bit for fresh air.We brought our own fan/white noise since comments about noise. It was a bit noisier than other places stayed. Guess it depends on who's next door to you.,1-Oct-17,4
Centrally located to attractions and shopping. Room interiors tired but excellent customer service more than compensates. Nothing is a problem or bother for the staff we came into contact with from the doormen to check in desk to housekeeping.Designated smoking area just outside the front entrance - a touch I think is very thoughtful and considerate of smokers.Would recommend.,30-Sep-17,5
"Hotel is centrally located to everything in San Francisco. Facilities and room were clean and modern. My room offered a fantastic view of the city. The hotel offers a smaller footprint, and even though I was there for a meeting, the meeting rooms were in the basement, so you didn't feel like you were at a large meeting hotel.",30-Sep-17,5
"Fantastic hotel. Caring staff. Great business stay hotel, convenient location. F&B is worth enjoying. You don't need to leave the hotel, but if you happened to want to do so, there are an unlimited number of restaurants, a CVS, a Walgreens, a Starbucks, and an Apple Store immediately outside the hotel. ",29-Sep-17,5
The staff is very professional yet personable. They all smile and say hello and ask if you need anything. The hotel is maintained excellently. Everything flows from the time you walk through the front door until you check out. They always remember you and make you feel welcome and important.,28-Sep-17,5
"We were in San Fran for vacation and this hotel just made our visit easier. Check in was a breeze, the room was clean with a comfortable bed and a fridge.We never had to call down because something wasn't right, they give free water, and when we wanted to park our rental in front of the hotel for a bit, it was no problem. They just asked us to leave the keys and they would move it if necessary.The location is fantastic, the staff were friendly, professional and helpful and our stay was worth every penny.If you go here, be sure to go up the 36th floor. It's an amazing view.",28-Sep-17,5
"Good hotel. Excellent location. Staff polite. The room is not comfortable for 4 (myself, my wife and two kids), a bit small. The shower is horrible! Overall, it is a good hotel but for sure is overpriced for what it delivers. ",27-Sep-17,3
"it is a very trendy and yet friendly hotel, located right at the center of San Francisco downtown. You can experience the happiness atmosphere of SF around this hotel.Nice faculty, impeccable house keeping, excellent club lounge as wellThe only minor thing is the toilet flash hook is loose, I need to open the cover and put it back from time to timeI have a three day stay this time, really hope to stay longer with such a good team and propertyCongratulation to this hotel! I think I just find a second home here at this Grand Hyatt San FranciscoWill I be back again? Sure, we have a great time and will be here over and over again!",26-Sep-17,5
"We stayed here for 2 nights without any issues or hiccups. On our first day we discovered that one of the blinds was slightly torn and the bathroom door was stuck towards the end of its rail and difficult to close but this was attended to almost immediately as soon as we notified the front desk so no complaints there! Access to Union Square and Powell street BART is very easy, also a Trader Joe's a 10 minute walk away for any groceries that was recommended by the concierge. Staff are friendly and attentive. If you are after tours of San Francisco, ask the concierge as they are knowledgable and have good discounts. Rooms expensive but worth the price as they are luxurious but not over the top with a fridge and big comfortable beds. Would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again! ",26-Sep-17,5
"Very impressed with everything in the hotel from check-in, during the stay, until check-out. Room was comfortable and ambience was great for a quality rest after a long day of outing. The interconnecting rooms worked very well for travelers with family. Location of hotel was good with many eatery joins and shopping malls around. Safe environment for family vacation.",26-Sep-17,4
"I have stayed at this property a few times. I was remembered nor was my loyalty to Hyatt referenced. My intention for this stay was a ""get away"" weekend with my husband. I was hoping for a first-class experience and didn't receive that. The check-in process was slow and not overly friendly. Employees in and around the lobby made no point to engage or say hi. The bellmen and door attendants were talking more to each other than guests. The gentlemen in the lounge was lovely and super accommodating. Although he never used my name nor conversational engaged with me, he was friendly and kind. I was extremely unhappy with my room. You can hear everything in the room next door. We had to call the front desk and complain about the noise. The guests in the room next to us never stopped having a party. We heard them until 2 am. It was the least restful night I have ever experienced. All-in-all, this wasn't the weekend experience we hoped. I am just disappointed by the customer service and response to our noise complaint. We had other options but hoped staying with a brand we are loyal would enhance this weekend retreat.",26-Sep-17,1
"Excelent hotel in Union Square. Excelent localization ( close to market street, malls, cable car, restaurants, bart) . Very good service room, check in/out and concierge. The room is big, beautiful and very confortable. I really appreciated it and strongly recommend.",24-Sep-17,5
"Spent a week in S.F. And really enjoyed the location of the Grand Hyatt. It's 1 block from the actual Union Square, close to great shopping and great restaurants. Even liked the convenience of the CVS across the street. All the tourist spots are a short Uber/Lyft ride. The is a great base hotel to enjoy San Francisco. ",23-Sep-17,5
"This hotel is perfectly situated for the business traveler or for vacation. It's close to BART and the cable car line. Right in Union Square for shopping. Hotel is very clean and recently updated rooms. The lobby and lounge areas are open and modern. Food and beverage at the lounge are very good. Note if you are driving and need parking,use the off site option-it's $39/night vs $60 for valet and is literally across the street!",23-Sep-17,4
"Located by Union Square, easy walking to restaurants and shops, and great hotel amenities made this a perfect downtown hotel for us. Top notch casual restaurant, wine bar, coffee bar, and plenty of cool seating around the lobby with WiFi. Short cab ride (or short uphill hike) to Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins hotel for the best Sunday brunch and 360 degree views of the bay and city...but instead of the tiny bathrooms and musty old world charm of the Hopkins, this Hyatt has bright energy, spacious bathrooms to accommodate a couple getting ready together, and a womanâ€™s favorite little touches like a makeup mirror and plenty of storage drawers etc. ",22-Sep-17,5
"Great hotel in a perfect location 100 yards from Union square, we upgraded to the grand club at a cost of $75 a night for the two of us and it was worth every penny. The room was perfect on the 31st floor with stunning views of the city. The Grand Club on the 32nd floor is brilliant. Excellent selection of breakfast foods hot and cold plus a great selection of evening food again hot and cold eaten with the best view of the city from two different angles. There is a Honour bar in place at $3 for a wine or beer $4 for a spirit, and thats for a full glass of wine. Trust me at well over $10 a small drink in the town this is well worth the little extra.A special mention must go to Dave and Jimmie who work the grand club in the evening, the perfect hosts.",22-Sep-17,5
"I am a big fan of Grand Hyatt in San Francisco, very good locations, nice rooms, cordially staff and the best Breakfast in town. Their policy to accept Pets is also a key differentiator for our family",20-Sep-17,5
"The stay though brief was a perfect getaway to see family and friends. Hyatt was clean friendly and enhance the whole experience. Staff friendly, the property in a perfect location was clean and room was spaceous and had a great view. Breakfast in the lounge was perfect with a good choice of food, clean are and great views. ",19-Sep-17,5
"We stayed in Grand Hyatt SF for the Labor Day weekend. Even though it was quite busy the wait to check-in was relatively quick. I was disappointed that I never got an email update to tell me my room was ready even though I checked in online. Valet was quick and as others have said tell them you want to self-park it requesting a voucher. Well worth the savings. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Loved Tacorea which is just a five minute walk from the hotel. Also some other fusion restaurants nearby. You can easily catch the trolley from the hotel to Fisherman's Wharf. I upgraded our room to a junior suite. If it's in your budget I found it well worth it as it comes with a connected living room with work desk. Bed was comfortable. Housekeeping was awesome in keeping the rooms spotless and replenishing our bathroom supplies since we were here for several days. The phones have a built in usb port to charge your devices which is very convenient. We didn't have a bathtub but the pressure from the shower was awesome.We had a slight incident with the parking garage which was not fault of this hotel. The hotel manager instantly called the garage and had them give me a call. It looks like it was just a misunderstanding but really appreciate Hyatt's service and management trying to solve issues. We used the concierge a few times. They were friendly, efficient, and got us to where we needed to go. I would have given this hotel a 5 star but since space is limited I didn't find them to have much dining options I would expect from a hotel this size (have bar & restaurant but small). Our room was located next to the service room with elevator so could hear it when it zooms by. It didn't bother us much except to wonder where this sound was coming from. Also I would suggest they consider taking the top floor and renovating it to a bar/restaurant. Hint: Go to the top floor if not being used as you can get views of the SF Harbor. Unfortunately we didn't realize this until the last day when it was cloudy. Will definitely stay at Grand Hyatt SF again due to location and its awesome service levels.",19-Sep-17,4
"The hotel is easy to find and the service on reception was very good and welcoming. We were offered free bottled water when we checked in, and were able to check in early. The room was massive compared to European hotels I'm used to. The bed was enormous and extremely comfortable. The TV worked very well and the little fridge was handy for keeping bottles cool. I couldn't figure out how to operate the safe in the room.The bathroom felt quite fancy and the shower worked well. Toiletries were provided and replenished every day. Everything was kept very clean. my only minor criticism was that the maid started running the hoover round (either outside our door or in the room next door - I wasn't sure) at around 8.30am some mornings. This seemed a bit early to me as it was loud enough to wake me up. But I guess with a 36 storey building they've got a lot of rooms to get through.Reception were helpful with any queries I had and we ate in the restaurant on the mezzanine level twice. The service in the restaurant was excellent and the food extremely tasty. One night we arrived quite late (about 9.45pm and the restaurant is only supposed to be open until 10pm) but we were warmly welcomed and did not feel at all rushed. The prices were a little bit on the high side, but the quality was very good so it was worth it. The menu isn't massive but there were two vegetarian options which was good. Overall - recommend eating here.",19-Sep-17,5
"I really appreciated the 'home away from home' feeling with the generous service of providing additional items free of charge if you forgot something (example - deodorant, hairspray) and or borrowing larger items for the duration of your stay. (example - hair straightener, kettle) Having travelled from Australia on a long flight it was wonderful to be checked in 6 hours early. Perfect location for San Francisco - close to walk to everything. Would recommend - loved staying here!",19-Sep-17,5
"I had a suite and an experience that was almost great. Great view, terrific living room and dining area, two bathroom, small kitchen area. Check-in and valet service was excellent. So why wasn't it great? After all, San Francisco is expensive and there are far worse! True. But I don't think Grand Hyatt is going to respond to this and say that my expectations were unreasonably high. I'm not trying to convince anyone they should stay here. The San Francisco market is tough and perhaps they don't need to make more of an effort to do very well. Money comes in, keep costs under control? That's business I suppose, but doesn't make a 5* hotel experience. A few notes. Some may help you decide on the place. Others may help the Grand Hyatt should try want to go the extra mile. 1. You expect a certain noise level in the city, but I definitely heard both city noise outside and elevator whirrs inside, even though we were on the 32nd floor. There were earplugs in the bathroom, so I think they know people often react this way. They can't do anything about this, obviously, and I'm sure most places in S.F. would be the same. Other than maybe the Lowes? I haven't tried the Ritz or the Four Seasons in S.F. 2. The kitchen had two small refrigerators, a microwave, and a Nespresso machine. That's it. No cutlery. No mugs or proper expresso cups or glasses or wine glasses. No plates. Only paper travel coffee cups that didn't even fit under the nozzle of the Nespresso machine. That's pretty sad and is easily fixed. For the price and given the space, I don't think this is an unreasonable expectation. It wasn't worth my complaining -- minor annoyance given my needs, but strikingly different from other experiences I've had at this level. 3. Yes, there were two bathrooms, but they were uninspiring. Standard 4* chain hotel bathrooms with shower stalls, and not large. Lacking the same range of amenities that frankly I enjoyed at the Marriott Marquis (yes, really!) the night before, which I found very surprising. Yes, they are stuck with the space as designed, but I'm pretty sure the Grand Hyatt wants to be seen as one of the best with respect to the smaller details. The Grand Hyatt in Seoul? Wow. San Fran? Ok, fine, very nice. Not 5*. 4. The double-door between the bedroom and living/dining room was locked on both sides when we arrived. It took a few minutes to figure out there were multiple entry doors to the suite, and then to figure out how to unlock the doors. They didn't make me feel like they were ready for me (at 5 PM?) and had prepped the room. Fine for a 4* experience if that is their aspiration. They could do better with what they have with very little extra effort.",19-Sep-17,4
I have stayed in a lot of hotels and yet the entire experience of this one was next level. Service went about and beyond. I can not recommend this place highly enough and will be making it my first choice if I return to San Fran. I did upgrade to a view of union square for $10. Was well worth it,18-Sep-17,5
"Great location. Clean and quiet. Fast elevators. Staff pleasant. Good club room for breakfast, recommended. Only drawback, expensive; however, San Francisco hotels generally fall into that catagory. Would stay again if I have the means.",18-Sep-17,4
It was pretty much like you can expect on a Grand Hyatt. Nice and clean quiet rooms and friendly staff. The location close the Union Square with all shopping etc was really good. They also have a nice bar and restaurant on the first floor which is definitely worth a visit.,18-Sep-17,4

"great choice if you have a good deal. modern, clean, excellent serviced hotel in great location, 5 minutes walk from union square.expect a $10 charge if you order something online with the delivery to your room: a parcel will be stored at the bell boy's facilities, and the hotel will charge you for receiving/storage.you won't get loyalty points if you book thru booking.com or other similar platforms.",17-Sep-17,5
"I recently spent two nights on a business trip in this very quiet and well appointed hotel. It was clean and updated - even had a light-up magnifying mirror :) Very business-woman friendly. The bed was super comfortable and the room temp was easy to adjust - making for a perfect night's sleep. The staff is exceptional - from the folks at the curb, check in and the restaurant. Great experience.",17-Sep-17,5

"The Grand Hyatt off Union Square is a beautifully designed architectural space and the service is splendid. In my case, I encountered problems with the advertised Chromecast connection of YouTube to the TV despite quick help from an engineer. Otherwise all was splendid, including the 35th floor fitness center with the panoramic views that is so popular that you have to queue for elliptical machines at 6:30 am.",15-Sep-17,5
Used the grand Hyatt as our base hotel for our San Francisco wedding. Had the premiere suite for the girls to get ready the day of the wedding. Had the VIP Suite for the guys to get ready. Was PERFECT. The Hyatt took care of every request.. from steamers for the dresses to extra mirrors and extension cords. Friends had the chef prepare snacks and cheese trays for the rooms. The chef even came up to say hello. The Hyatt supplied our own go to person who did an excellent job. The rooms were clean and updated and ALL the staff were friendly and caring. I would recommend the Grand Hyatt in a heartbeat!,14-Sep-17,5
"The upgrade is well worth it. Breakfast was tasty. Dinner was so good with rotating menues. One night was Indian, the next night was thai, and our last night was fried chicken, mac & cheese and cole slaw. The desserts were fabulous. Add in the honor bar and the best club staff and it really seals the deal. ",14-Sep-17,5
"We spent two great nights here at the Grand Hyatt. The staff really could not do enough. to help us. Check in was a breeze, the room spotlessly clean and the house keeping staff very pleasant and courteous.The beds were very comfortable and the air con easily adjustable to suit my needs. ",13-Sep-17,4
"We stayed for 10 days as we were staying put in SF for a holiday (from AU). We had a king suite with city views on the 26th floor. We were really happy with the good size of the room (especially for SF), the great view and the bed was very comfortable. The fit out was what you would expect from this type of hotel (pleasant, contemporary, clean), although I must say some parts of the room looked a little worn however this was not overly noticeable. The daily clean of the room was also done efficiently and earlier in the day. The location of this hotel is excellent, you are in the centre of it all and can uber easily and cheaply anywhere around the city. We were only unhappy with a few things in the beginning. When we arrived I noticed there was no mini bar, no kettle, no toiletries you would expect like shower cap, no robes etc... I did not expect this. Not great after travelling 17 hours. I then discovered a list (called the 'missing items from your room') on the bench that required you to request basic things that would be provided at any other hotel of this nature. We have stayed in hotels around the world and I've never come across this before. I was very annoyed so we rang up and requested the things we would need for the length of our stay and they brought them up with no trouble...so in the end it was ok. Still, I don't understand this and I think it's a bad move. It's been a while since I was in the US but I doubt this is common place. The other thing was the quality of the daily breakfasts...they were ok. The variety was generally good but the quality of the food needs to be improved substaintialy (particularly for the price). I've stayed in quite a few Hyatts over time and the breakfasts have been better than this one. That being said, I would stay again for all of the positives I mentioned. All of the staff were lovely and friendly. Just wanted to warn you about the list of missing items so you know!",13-Sep-17,4
"We had a great time staying at this hotel. It's in a great location with a lot of shopping and everything you could want within walking distance. There were a couple hiccups, but they were quickly rectified by the staff, which is why I'm still giving 5 stars. The staff were amazing at making our stay incredible. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. ",13-Sep-17,5
"Very well-located hotel. Close to Union Square and to Chinatown. Modern, clean hotel with helpful staff. Very expensive breakfast. Go to Starbucks across the street. Quiet, well-appointed room, but could use better lighting.",13-Sep-17,5
"This is a beautiful property right in the heart of the city. The view from your room are excellent as is the service of their staff. The club is attractive and comfortable with a host of beverages including alcohol you can purchase in their honor bar. Beyond the hotel, you are literally just steps away from world class shopping, restaurants and theater.",13-Sep-17,5

"This was our main hotel for my daughter's wedding. Alyssa Keast and Karoline Huber were my personal contacts for needs and did an incredible job. The rooms were amazing and all our wedding guests were taken great care of. We had a bridal suite for the girls to get ready in..the hotel brought in steamers, mirrors, extra extension cords, ...everything that bridesmaids would need to get ready. Also, friends had the hotel bring in food for the bridesmaids...wonderfully served and presented! The hotel through Alyssa was very attentive to all of our needs. When the rehearsal could not be at the venue (fort mason general's residence), Alyssa quickly booked a Bayview Conference Room on the top floor that proved to be an awesome place for the rehearsal. The hotel delivered all the guest bags to guest rooms promptly and took care of any detail we needed. The housekeeping staff was friendly and also seemed to really care that we were all satisfied. The hotel itself was conveniently located to many areas of town that our guests could walk to. I can highly recommend the Grand Hyatt for any big group gathering, especially wedding parties and the bride and groom!",12-Sep-17,5
"we stayed for 5 nights the hotel was clean and comfortable. All requests were handled efficiently. It was central to restaurants and bars near union square and not too far from fishermans wharf. We were on the fifth floor which was quiet, no problems",12-Sep-17,5
"Hotel is centrally located. Rooms are a little tired and buffet breakfast ordinary. Although, staff are friendly & welcoming. Complimentary bottles of water & fresh fruit daily is a nice touch. I would consider staying at this hotel again.",11-Sep-17,4
"Hotel has a beautiful location, rooms and views. proximity and access makes this one of my favorites in San Francisco. i would recommend getting to the 32nd floor for the view of the city which is amazing.",11-Sep-17,5
Had to stay at the place twice in the past year. Nothing special - typical Hyatt mid-level business hotel with bland dÃ©cor. Rooms close to the elevators can be noisy. Nearby streets typical for downtown SF - a fair few homeless people with a definite urine odor. Good internet service.,10-Sep-17,3
"Stayed overnight in SF on the way to an Airbnb in Mill Valley. We stayed in an executive room which gave us access to hors d'oeuvres and breakfast in their ""club"". Our kids stayed in another room. Both rooms were beautiful, clean and spacious. Bathroom was great. The staff was welcoming and helpful. Breakfast and evening snacks were delicious and there was a great variety offered. Staff there was friendly and helpful. Hotel was in a great location and we walked everywhere. Valet parking courteous and efficient. No negatives here- would stay here again anytime. ",10-Sep-17,5
"We stayed at this hotel for five way too short days this summer. Our travel agent got us connecting rooms and we really enjoyed the wonderful rooms, And best part of all is the central location to downtown San Francisco. We could easily walk around the area to many restaurants, coffee shops (Starbucks right across from the entrance) Apple Store on the same block, and so much shopping too! No need to take a taxi to eat or drink. The rooms are big, comfortable, ours had automatic window coverings and big bathrooms. Will stay here again for sure",9-Sep-17,5
We had the most wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt. The rooms were incredibly comfortable and the views over the city are breathtaking.But it's really the personal service that blew me away. On our first night we were gifted a complementary breakfast in celebration of a special occasion. This was so special and a real treat.During our visit I also received the most excellent service from Ira and she made our stay extra special through a very kind gesture.These people care about their guests. You do really feel that you take first priority and that your custom is valued. I cannot recommend staying here enough! ,8-Sep-17,5
"The Hyatt on Union Square is the very best location in San Francisco. This hotel has been remodeled and is very comfortable. The staff (from the fellow at the front door that minded my bag, to check-in and check-out (at 5 am) and particular the waiter in the restaurant who helped my customize my menu selectins) are attentive and well trained. Every aspect of the stay was enjoyable.",8-Sep-17,5
"Being a Hyatt member, I received an offer of an upgrade at 50% the normal daily rate to a room with access to the Executive lounge, which offered daily continental breakfast starting 5:30am in the mornings with horderves between 5:30pm and 7:00pm, which I consider extremely good value.",8-Sep-17,4

"Big room for a major US city. Bed comfortable, furniture slightly quirky with a 70s vibe (in a good way) but room a little cold. Although I cranked the heating up high (80 degrees) the room didn't appreciably warm for my entire 3 day stay.Had flown in from the UK so was too tired to eat in the restaurant or go out so decided to order from room service but was astounded to find room service menu offered NOTHING gluten free. I even rang down to check, and frankly they couldn't really have cared less. I have never stayed in an international chain hotel (much less a Californian one!) that had no GF options! I've been a coeliac for 19 years and this is a throw-back to the US of old (15 years ago I really struggled to find anything GF in the states). During this trip I also stayed in Georgia and Indiana and encountered no such problems in Hotels there.",6-Sep-17,3
"Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was very enjoyable. Clean, comfortable beds, convenient to everything. They had a nice restaurant in the hotel that had great drinks and food. I would recommend this hotel. The only down side was no balcony. ",5-Sep-17,4
"in the heart of the financial district in walking distance from many of the city's main attractions. but also not completely tidy, mediocre service and overpriced. SF is obviously a very expensive place, but there are certainly much better deals than this.",5-Sep-17,3
"There are lots of hotels to choose from on and off Union Square -- this one is very hard to beat in terms of value. The rooms are excellent and plush, the staff is supremely attentive, and the place is quiet and tranquil.",5-Sep-17,5
I had a nice experience staying here. Room was clean and I had a great view of the city. Food in the lounge was good and the service was great. Enjoyed some tapas and some wine while I did some work. Front desk folks were very helpful.,5-Sep-17,5
"We had a room with bay view on the 27 th floor: amazing view on the SF skyline and Alcatraz.The room was very clean with nice bathroom, but the room was not sufficiently illuminated.Room quite expensive.The bar of the hotel is not well situated (1 st floor) and not worth a 4 star hotel.",4-Sep-17,4
There is a parking garage next door with a 39.00 daily fee With in and out privileges. They partner with hotel. Safe and professional. Hotel is a block from trolley that will take you to fishermens wharf and union square is the best place to be. ,4-Sep-17,4
We recently stayed at the hotel for 6 nites with our teens. Hotel is located right opposite union square. One block away from Powell-Hyde cable car route and a couple of blocks from market street where there are more transit choices. Hotel was very clean - only disappointing aspect was the ripped bed sheets. Concierges were very helpful and knowledgeable with directions and tourist activities. Great fitness room on the 36th floor. There is a tiny breakfast bar that's not included with your hotel cost but there's a Starbucks directly opposite the hotel. We would definitely stay at the grand Hyatt again! ,2-Sep-17,4
"This was a great location for our short SF getaway. It was a short walk to Chinatown, to the cable cars and to shopping. The room was fine. For some reason housekeeping was petty all 3 days. We had 3 in the room and they would leave 3 bath towels but only 2 of everything else. ",2-Sep-17,4
"Stayed one night, great location, nice quiet room, provided the air conditioning is turned off, the view from the room wasn't all that exciting but I was only on the 3rd floor, guest parking is located across the street but there's no validation but definitely cheaper options than other places nearby ",30-Aug-17,4
"good to great location. room was small for the price but probably inline for being a block to Union Square. Buffet breakfast, which was included with our package, was at least 6/10 and they didn't charge us extra for our 10 year old.",29-Aug-17,3
"We stayed two nights here at the end of our honeymoon. We got the upgraded bay view and it was worth it. Beautiful view of both the city, the water, and almost Alcatraz. Room was very clean, very modern, and had everything we needed. Staff was friendly and there are some great places to go within just a few blocks. It's a little pricey, but I think that's the theme of San Francisco, so I'd recommend staying here if only for the views and location. ",28-Aug-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt at Union Square is similar to most hotels of its ilk..good service, clean if uninspiring rooms, excellent bar. Its big plus is its location; Union Sqaure, Market Street, restaurants , Cable cars, etc.",27-Aug-17,4
"We truly enjoyed our stay here. The entire staff was gracious and helpful. The suite we were in was well appointed. The grand club is great with wonderful views and the staff there were extraordinary. We were surprised that a hotel this size does not have a swimming pool. All in all, we had a great stay, and we would certainly return.",27-Aug-17,4
"stayed here August 2017 prior to flight from SFO. Clean, modern hotel. Spacious rooms, with free wifi, aircon, coffee maker, and blackout blinds etc. Good quality bathroom and shower. Had breakfast included. Good selection of hot items, cereals, fruits, pastries etc. Ideal for SFO, 10 minutes by complementary shuttle every 15 minutes or so. Would definitely stay again.",27-Aug-17,4
"The staff was very courteous when we needed information. Close to Union Square and the Piers. Very clean, and walking not bad at all. Restaurants all around, I found people just getting their business done, no problems at all. We enjoyed every bit of it, as well as the tours and the responsible parties. They gave us information we didn't know of San Francisco. Loved it. Thank You.",27-Aug-17,4
"I booked this hotel as the room was significantly larger than other hotels in SF. I was not disappointed. There was a king size bed with lots of room on either side, a long bench to either place things on or to sit at. There also was a small bench and chair with a mirror just outside the bathroom. The sensor lights next to the bed side cabinets would light up the floor as soon you you got out of bed - really good idea.The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, especially the concierge with all their suggestions, especially the market at the ferry terminal on Saturdays.The hotel location is close to china town and in a good position in Union Square. It is not as frantic as Powell Street, but still busy.",27-Aug-17,5
"Paid the extra for a Bay view and was not disappointed! 28th floor, awesome view. Be sure to check out the 36th floor observation area. Staff was brilliant. Great location - walk or ride, bus stops and trolley nearby. Recommend visiting the local tourist information location nearby. Great staff and lots of info. Gave us time saving tips on getting around. (Go for the buses! Trolley was always packed and took forever to get to destination.)",27-Aug-17,5
"Wonderful hotel! The room was beautiful with a great view! Staff was friendly and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone. You don't feel like you're a guest, they make you feel like you're at home.",26-Aug-17,5
"Located where Union Square segues into Chinatown, it was extremely convenient; very close to any kind of transportation. The rooms were clean, comfortable, quiet, & fairly large by SF standards; the beds were exceptionally welcoming. I did find the frosted glass sliding bathroom door to be less than ideal for privacy and noise containment (flushing sounded quite loud in the room). The staff was all very pleasant, courteous and helpful. Valet parking was $68/day, but well worth it, as driving is chaotic around there. We stayed on the 5th floor fairly close to the elevator lobby, but as already mentioned, it was very quiet. The (free) Dasani water dispenser next to the ice machine was a very nice touch & surprise, most hotels charge $2 for a small bottle of water. The elevators are very fast. I think most people would enjoy staying there, we certainly did.",26-Aug-17,4
"Good sized clean rooms in great location . Breakfast only included 2 and there were 3 of us and was an additional 32 dollars for the buffet. Although other choices on the menu which were cheaper by the time you added a drink you were nearly up to the same amount as the buffet. Appeared cheaper to order room service for our teenager ( her choice ) and when her pancakes arrived there was an additional 5 dollar delivery charge and taxes on top - again , not much difference than the cost of the buffet breakfast . There is a Starbucks right opposite the hotel which we and a lot of other people were visiting as was much cheaper . Other than that all good , concierge good , especially the very helpful gentleman named John . Also breakfast staff friendly especially Tho who was so helpful . Not much equipment in the gym but all were recent models and a great view over San Francisco and was very clean . ",25-Aug-17,4
"We needed one night in SF prior to our flight home to Sydney the next evening. Hyatt gave us extended check out time, looked after our baggage after checkout, staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel is clean and modern and located in good position in Union Square, a nice 10 min walk to BART station.",23-Aug-17,5
"From check-in to check-out, it truly seemed their goal is to keep their guests satisfied. From Betsy who checked us in, to bellhops who were always ready to help, and house cleaning staff who were there in a jiffy for every request, they made our 4 night stay a great one. Tip - try to get a room on a high floor with a view of the cityscape.",22-Aug-17,5
"I you go to San Francisco..... u gota stay here ! Gray hotel, perfect location , close to everything, great staff, beautiful room great view, close to China town, 39th street piers, and the Cliff house......we will be back",22-Aug-17,5

"Excellent hotel and great location. Checking in late at night was seamless. The room had a great view, clean, comfortable bed, awesome shower with the best toiletries. The lobby was welcoming and we were always greeted with kindness. ",21-Aug-17,5
"First visit since the property was remodeled. Very pleased with the vibe, the aesthetics, the fit/finish of the rooms. HighlightsLocation, quality of room, Grand Club food and beverage options, speed of elevators, amenities in the room, views from the GymThings To ImproveGym is too small, bed needs a mattress cover, surrounding streets are kind of noisy, reception is a little chaotic, cover charge for drinks in the Grand Club is a nuisance and a detractorOverall I am a fan and will return",21-Aug-17,5
Loved this hotel. Room was perfect. Electric blind was a nice touch. Staff could not do enough for you. Just off of Union Square and Chinatown. Great location. Cable Cars run a few minutes from here.I could not recommend this hotel more. Made our stay in SF that much better.,21-Aug-17,5
Really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. Had not been to San Francisco is some time and really Luke's how the hotel common areas and the rooms were redone. The vessel sinks are nice but not always very practical. Also miss the bath robes. But the staff could not have been nicer or more welcoming. We will come back. ,21-Aug-17,5
"Easy to find, very convenient location. Parking is typical San Francisco, $67 a day for on-site valet, $39 a day for covered valet right across the street. 24-hour CVS directly across. Reasonably Quiet at night with blackout powered blinds. Excellent shower and generous sink. Very nice beds and pillows. Easy and efficient temperature control. Nice TV. Fast room service. Fast free Wifi. Limited menu, but all good. Small but important, for a huge hotel, the wait for an elevator is minimal, because they have six cars. Very fine gym open 24-7. Staff is well-trained. If you want trendy boutique hotel or Michelin restaurant in-house this isn't your spot. But it's a fine, hassle free place to stay, in the middle of Union Square at a reasonable price. ",21-Aug-17,5
"I've stayed at Hyatt hotels all around the world and at several Grand Hyatt's. I'm a member of thier World if Hyatt frequent guest program and do think the chain is a good value, but this hotel was a huge disappointment and not a good value for the money. Granted its in the middle of the city so I understand the high room rate, but to me that is just another reason the hotel should live up to its ""Grand"" reputation. Issues:1.) Hyatt sent an upgrade offer that linked to nothing and nobody could verify which I would have purchased.2.) Room was microscopic.3.) Wireless was slower than dial-up. Gave up after an hour of trying. 4.) Shower pressure like a water fountain. Too low to activate massage. 5.) Room very worn down. Expected better. Not up to Hyatt standards. ",20-Aug-17,2
"This hotel is beautiful and modern from the time you enter. Everyone is helpful. The gorgeous living room inspired lobby with classy full length wall art caught my eye. The rooms are modern and well spaced. The bar in the hotel is worth going to.Whats best is the location, you're right in the heart of union square. Turn right and its chinatown. So really you can't go wrong here. Loved our stay here.",19-Aug-17,5
The Grand Hyatt is located close to Union Square and close to many attractions like Chinatown. Our room was fairly large with 2 queen beds with very comfortable mattresses. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They seemed dedicated to our having a great time in the city. They were a wealth of information. Best to access the hotel from the Montgomery Street station. Complimentary breakfast.,18-Aug-17,4
"VIP appartment was very spacious and comfortable, with a nice view of the city from the 34th floor. It was a nice stay for our family of 5 for 5 days during our holidays. The only disadvantage is the lack of a private parking at the hotel, but there is a paid valet parking on the other side of the street.",18-Aug-17,5
"We spent many evenings searching Hotels in the Union Square area of SF. We decided on this one. The location is perfect One block from Union Square and all the super expensive shopping in the area if your into that kind of thing. Its a block away from the Dragons Gate, the entrance to China Town which can be great. Starbucks across the street if needed and tons of local food walking distance. The area was clean and we walked back to the room very late at night and didn't feel at risk. We even walked back from a Giants game and it only took 20 minutes and the streets were full of people so felt even better. The hotel has underground valet parking across the street. We paid for the parking and that made things much easier and cheaper. The lobby was super clean and the staff was superb. Get to the room and had an amazing city view and a very clean room. The room was smaller than what I am used to. There were 2 Queen beds but no couch or love seat. Just one desk chair. In the morning there was a small coffee and snack shop in the lobby that was nice. Overall, great location, easy to walk in and out of, Great staff, and clean rooms. Would go back.",16-Aug-17,4
"This hotel is perfectly located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, near Union Square. The area is surrounded by great selection of restaurants and shopping. The hotel staff is generally friendly and attentive. The only draw back is the hotels in house restaurant is average at best. One note for ladies - the rooms lighting at night and in the bathrooms is awful for make-up application and the dryer is not suitable for styling. Otherwise great hotel when in San Francisco as access to roads to favorite attractions is easy. And visits to Sonoma County and Napa Valley are within a 90 minute drive from this central location!",16-Aug-17,4
"My wife and I stayed here for only a couple nights from a business trip. The hotel was beautiful, easy to maneuver around, and the staff was polite and helpful. The room was well designed and had all the updated features you'd find in modern hotels. The only complaint I have, is the size of the room. I've stayed in Motel 6 rooms that were bigger. The view from our room of San Francisco was amazing to say the least. Around the hotel were a nice selection of food, especially Uncle Vito's Pizza up the street. There were two Starbucks right out the front door in both directions. Would definitely stay here again.",16-Aug-17,4
"Had a chance to stay at their Grand Club room (king bed). Overall favorable but could improve given competitors nearbyPros- great location for leisure visitors (shopping, dining, attractions) I walked everywhere from the hotel - good room: clean, large, great view, comfy bed, especially like the walk in shower- club access for breakfast, snacks, drinks all fairly decent, don't over expect but the staff here were the friendliest and welcoming!Cons- the hotel is huge and lacks personal touch - competing on the same level as the IC, Nikko, amenities like slippers, shoehorns, etc. shouldn't need to be requested they should already be provided in the room- no complimentary bottled water provided",16-Aug-17,4
"I hate to say it (being a loyal Hyatt customer and having accumulated almost one million Hyatt points), but this stay was not a very good experience . . . It just seemed that the staff just ""phoned-it-in."" Dr. Greg",16-Aug-17,2
Best downtown location. The hotel was steps away from Union Square park. Close to shops and transportation. The room was large. The bathroom was also very up to date. Staff was friendly and polite. Good for solo travelers ,15-Aug-17,5
"The only thing that I can say good after the stay is its location. I am a frequent patron of Hyatt but this is probably one of the worst in Grand Hyatt / Park Hyatt line. Basically the business is so good, no one really cares about you. At one night, fire alarm set off at 3am, our whole family ran down 30 floors. But was told to immediately went back up as nothing happened. There was no explanation nor apology the next day. Again, no one really cares about you. The room was small (understandably) but the sound proof is awful. You will hear the summer wind hurling and whistling all night long and if you have a noisy neighbor. I won't choose this one again.",13-Aug-17,2
"I stayed in the San Francisco Grand Hyatt during the August 2017. I enjoyed my stay in the hotel. The staff was friendly and everyone always says, ""Good Morning."" I had all my questions answered including the best way to get to tourist destination such as Fisherman's Wharf.The only improvement the Grand Hyatt needs to work on, is to provide more amenities such as shampoo, hair conditioner, and shower gel, without having me to ask. I asked the hotel maid for such items and they provided for me.The location was excellent and only across the street from Union Square park and Macy's.",12-Aug-17,5
"Visiting as part of my honeymoon in California, this is the sixth hotel I am in the state so I have developed quite a knowledge in the field :). The location is ok and the room is clean that's it. Super small rooms 0 effort from the staff to accommodate us in a better room as part of our honeymoon, we are put in the 9th floor of 36 facing another building. Paying 360 $ a night no breakfast they say we can pay 30 dollars more for a room as small as the one we are staying but higher. We expressly asked for quiet room and it is sharing door with another room where u can hear your neighbours talk even if they are not loud (although this looks common in California). Breakfast is limited, to say the least, in quality and variety. we have stayed in other grand hyatt and they were much better than this. Not worth it",12-Aug-17,1
"The hotel has a great location next to all of the best shopping in SF. I walked to my office and felt safe both early in the AM and later in the PM. Great staff, clean rooms and great views of the city!",12-Aug-17,4
"This has been a very unfortunate trip to the Grand Hyatt on Union Square. No personal touch was exhibited at all this trip, which in the past has been a lovely hallmark of the experience here. Service has been very matter of fact. The crowning touch was that our room was not touched. So after a very long day, we arrived back to our room to towels on the floor and beds untouched. I'm fine with not changing bed linens, but please do make the bed. At $350/night, that's not too much to ask. I would not even mind reusing my towels IF--and that's a biggie-there were towel bars to hang up the dang towels. I actually did read the note in the bathroom, saying linens would not be changed until after the second night in a move toward conservation. Ok, then provide towel bars. And please make the beds, especially after we requested that service! Very, very disappointed in the service/ambiance/general tenor of this stay. Based on this visit, I would not recommend this property.",11-Aug-17,2
We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The staff was friendly and very helpful and it was very well located. We were walking distance from almost anything! The rooms were clean and room service was fast. We had a wonderful stay!,11-Aug-17,5
"Our stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco was typical of our experience with Hyatt hotels in other locations. The room met our needs and was efficiently cleaned. Notably, every staff member we encountered throughout the hotel was pleasant and agreeable, particularly in the reception area where the staff was proactively helpful.",11-Aug-17,5
Hotel is overpriced and dies not present good value for money at all. Customer service is terrible. Was not mentioned before stay that car park would be at additional cost. Gym is poor and no pool available. Overall in comparison with other Hystts NOT good value. ,10-Aug-17,1
"We actually stayed in November 2009, in the Penthouse Suite.It was the most romantic weekend and the hotel and staff were amazing.My husband and Hotel GM both share the same birthday. As a complementary surprise, we received a bottle of Champagne and a wonderful tray of Chocolate covered Strawberries.Not only was the room gorgeous, very central to all the San Fran sites, but convenient to the Bart as well.Thanks again, and we hope to come back again. ",9-Aug-17,5
"The room was ok, clean and relatively modern. But to pay almost $450 for a room without amenities, no minibar and queen bed is a bit tough.The real disappointment was the restaurant. $36 for a breakfast buffet with hardly anything on it. Worst was that we was ordering an omelette without onion to one in our party due to allergies. Not the hardest request. When we got it I looked ok. After a couple of bites we have an allergic reaction. The chef had according to the waiter missed the information....My recommendation, do not eat here.",9-Aug-17,2
"It's too bad. We've been coming to this hotel for over 2 decades, we usually come around Christmas season and summertime , sometimes for business or for pleasure. This last stay we had was for pleasure. We stayed for the whole entire week. When we check in we told the front desk that we requested for a higher floor and I called ahead of time for the confirmation of our reservation. The customer service said and that our higher floor request will have no problem when we check in. And so it goes. The middle age man who assisted us in our check in was just ok. He appeared as if helpful but not really. I asked several times to give us the higher floor because we did upgrade our room to higher floor with a city view, we payed extra for it. Once we reach the 20th floor ( obviously not the higher floor) to our big disappointment the room view was lousy. Overlooking from those ugly buildings side by side. I'm to the point that I don't even want to open the blinds just to evade looking at those uncharming buildings. To think that we stayed there for the entire week, the check in person could at least gave us an acceptable view . I will totally avoid this hotel next time. Take your money somewhere else. There is a lot more hotels out there or better yet just stay to the Hyatt Embarcadero. The whole entire people there are nice, talking about great customer service.",9-Aug-17,2
The staff and club level at this property made it worth our while. All needs met and exceeded. Great location - ended up spending way too much at Niketown. Food was great at both the club lounge and the inroom dining. Easy to feed our family of 5.,9-Aug-17,5
"My husband and I stayed here for my first visit to San Francisco and we couldn't be happier with the choice. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. We also had a fantastic view of the city out of the floor to ceiling windows. I loved to keep the shades open at night just so I could stare at the view of the city lights. The location was perfect! It is centrally located and within walking distance to lots of shopping and restaurants. The bar there was kind of dull, but they had the best buffalo wings I've ever had.The only issue I had with the place was the $400 hold they put on our credit card. I thought that was a bit excessive and no one could explain to me why it was so high. I was told it should have only been $200, but that was definitely not the case.Overall though we were happy with this hotel and would stay here again next time we're in San Francisco.",8-Aug-17,5
My family and I just got back from aweekend vacation in SFO. We stayed at the Grans Hyatt Hotel and had a great time. Service was first class from the door man to the restaurant. Easy and fast check in and the facilities were great overall. Highly recommeneded and we will be back!,8-Aug-17,5
"Huge hotel, but we didn't feel at a very busy place. No long waiting for elevators and no lines at reception.We got a very noisy room (they said it was the wind...) with a bathtub/shower combination. We complained about the noise and we got a new room right away, with great views and walk-in shower - we know that kind of 'upgrade' is not normal, but we were very happy with that.Room had very good size, however bathroom was VERY small and had a very odd rolling door that didn't close. Very bad in case you are not a single traveler. Common toiletries. Small towel size. Closet space was just ok and in room fridge didn't have anything in there. Also the hotel didn't have a place for us to buy water or other stuff to put in the fridge... Thanks for the CVS across the street!We didn't like the restaurant very much - Not too many appealing choices.Nice overall structure and GREAT location, with a direct pleasant garden access to Apple Store at Union Sq! Nice gym with great city views.Didn't use hotel services, but housekeeping was efficient. We definitely think that is a very good option! You know what to expect from a Grand Hyatt.",8-Aug-17,4
"This is a lovely comfortable hotel in the heart of San Francisco. All staff are helpful and friendly, the service is excellent . Rooms are comfortable with good facilities such as refrigerators. We didn't include breakfast. Highly recommend.",8-Aug-17,5
"This hotel has gone so far downhill in its quality of service that it is almost laughably bad at this point. After complaining about children in the room next to me screaming ""Help, someone is trying to kill me."" at the top of their lungs at 12:30 am, my call to the front desk was met with an offer of earplugs. The entire service staff feels inept and inexperienced. I'm even a World of Hyatt member and credit card holder, but was offered absolutely no acknowledgment for being a loyal customer. As a result, I no longer will be.",7-Aug-17,1
"really great views, design and staff. Super comfortable beds, tasty foods a bar great location. my only complaint was the noise from adjoining room door .. it was like the family next to me was in my room fighting all night. they need to add sound proofing between these doors!",7-Aug-17,5
Friendly and warm service starting at the reception. A good buzz and perfectly located at Union square - they have a good coffee and snack cart - and room service and housekeeper is extremely efficient - we loved our stay and recommended ! Near all the cool shops and restaurants - all in walking distance - the staff go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and pleasurable ,6-Aug-17,5
"We chose this hotel because it is central, however the service was terrible, view less than desirable- our room dirty and needs some repairs. Sink cracked, plug stuck and dirty......When we checked in we asked if we could pay to upgrade our room however the receptionist said ""ahhh we are fully booked, good luck."" Either way, we asked for the pull away bed for our 7 year old however never arrived until we called again. When it did the gentleman was rude left in a hurry not even allowing us to tip him. Bathroom and beside the bed dirty, not enough towels or any towels rack-strange. How do they want us to conserve energy if we cannot hang our towels to dry. No water to purchase in the room. Overall would not suggest this hotel. ",5-Aug-17,2
"Two days after staying at a San Francisco hotel we ranked as the worst weâ€™ve ever visited, we checked into one of the best we've ever experienced.The bad â€“ the dump â€“ was the Klimpton Sir Francis Drake, which Iâ€™ve previously reviewed. The best is the Grand Hyatt.First off, the Hyatt was spotlessly clean, both in its public spaces and in our room. The marble, stone, and tiled surfaces were immaculate; the carpets showed no signs of wear.Our lunch in the mezzanine restaurant offered a good variety of hot and cold dishes at a reasonable price; the service was prompt, friendly, and efficient.We opted to pay a bit extra for access to the club room on the 32nd floor. The snacks in the evening were enough for a light dinner. The breakfast buffet was outstanding: scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and pastries, lox and bagels, hot and cold cereal, milk, juices, coffee, and tea.Our room was large, almost twice the size of the Drakeâ€™s, as was the bathroom. The bed was comfortable. The flat screen TV offered broadcast and cable stations and three or four movie channels. The view â€“ from the 30th floor â€“ was dramatic. (At the Drake weâ€™d looked out onto an alley.)All this for less than $50 more than weâ€™d paid at the Drake.",4-Aug-17,5
"We chose this hotel for its location right in Union Square. It is a very nice hotel, service was good. Rooms are really small though (225sq ft). We booked on the club floor and having access to the club lounge was fantastic and worthwhile. But we had hoped that the rooms were also a little larger on that floor (which they are not). Family of 4 in 225 sq ft is tight. If you are a single or couple, the room size would be fine. Parking in lot across the street from hotel is 1/2 the cost and safe and convenient.",4-Aug-17,4
"Nestled in the middle of the city, the Grand Hyatt provided us with an excellent stay from check in to the final valet send off, we enjoyed every moment! Sleek modern styling is present everywhere. The check in desk as smooth and efficient! We had utilized the Hyatt App to check in early, so it literally took a half minute. Then, we had the opportunity to enjoy our room. The 15th floor was high enough to give us great views of the bay and union square. The bathroom was spacious and everything was spotless!The second floor has a restaurant and bar that had very stylish and clean lines. While we did not enjoy any food at the restaurant, my husband and I enjoyed a late night wine. They had an iPad that detailed their different offerings that made it easy to order. The bartender was attentive, but not hovering. It was a great evening! The valet services were excellent! Our car was ready for us each time in very quick fashion! When we were packing up to leave, the valet presented us with four ice cold bottles of water for our trip. While not a huge deal, it exemplifies what we experienced during our stay at the Grand Hyatt!... amazing service! ",3-Aug-17,5
"Stayed for 10 days. Good location right in union square, good service and great hospitality. Room size good for family of four. Provided amenities if one forgets. Breakfast service is good. Would go back again ",3-Aug-17,5
"The location of the hotel is great and everything is within walking distance. The room is renovated and I enjoyed the city view. The staff was friendly and helpful. It is a busy hotel and more on the business type hotel. If I go to San Francisco again, I would choose to stay in this area rather than Fisherman's Wharf.",2-Aug-17,4
"The included continental breakfast consisted of ONE COFFEE AND ONE PASTRY. Nothing with protein, just a sugar/carb high. Such an expensive hotel should care more about their guests' health and comfort.",1-Aug-17,1
"The Grand Hyatt is in a really good location --- easy walking distance to many attractions and also to transit to other locales. Our room overlooked Union Square, which would normally be quite nice, except major construction was going on on the streets below, making for some noisy mornings and even a couple of overnights. The room was well-appointed and clean, but a bit cramped for a family of 3. Overall, a good experience, but it would have been even better if the construction noise wasn't a factor.",31-Jul-17,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt and throughly enjoyed our experience. When I made the reservations, I signed up to become a Hyatt reward member (it's free!) and was offered an upgrade upon my arrival for a very reasonable cost. For only a little more, we ended up on the 31st floor with Grand Club access. The staff was helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the view from our room and the location of the hotel made it very easy to navigate to anywhere in San Francisco!",31-Jul-17,4
"We stayed here for two nights and had a wonderful stay! As soon as we arrived, we were greeted warmly by the doorman and asked if we needed help with our luggage. We were checked in by Wayne who was extremely friendly and personable and gave us a beautiful room on the 25th floor.The rooms are modern, sleek and stylish with nice amenities. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean throughout our stay. All of the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating. Vanessa, one of the concierges, was very nice and helpful in giving us information and restaurant recommendations. A week after we checked out, we were getting ready to go to the airport and I noticed on the car rental receipt that we were overcharged for the drop fee at the airport. I called the concierge and spoke with Joanne who was very busy at the time and asked if she could call me back. She contacted the car rental company and returned my call in just 30 minutes to let me know that she had taken care of it and that they had adjusted my bill! I appreciated her great service! If you are renting a car during your stay, I recommend going through the hotel because their rates are half the cost than booking it through the car rental agency on your own. We had a great experience and I highly recommend this hotel!",31-Jul-17,5
"The location of this hotel is really good. It's in the center of the city and close to to restaurants and shopping. The room is average for the price. If you want things like shower caps, robes and slippers, they all need to be requested. There isn't any bottled water in the room either. My problem is with the service. None of the staff members seemed passionate about their jobs. It felt like it was something they did just to pay the bills. One night I called room service to order a tofu dish. The lady on the phone was rude, she questioned where I had seen tofu on the menu, after I told her it was right under the healthy section, she insisted that they didn't have tofu. Her attitude was so bad that I decided instead of arguing with her, I would call the front desk and see if I can get someone with more sensible. The front desk told me he'd look into it. Then the manager of room service called me, apologized for the mistake and said that they do indeed have tofu and would make it for me for free. I thought my problems were solved at this time. Then 30 minutes later when the food came, the string beans I ordered were now mini carrots, which I am fine with. But my tofu was cold, barely room temperature and there was also a big blue/purple stain on it. I decided it would be safer if I didn't eat it. I also didn't trust the room-service people enough to order anything else. So in the end I just didn't even have dinner that night. I have stayed in at least 20 Hyatt hotels, and the experience ranges from totally amazing to just OK. This was by far the worst experience I have had at a Hyatt. ",30-Jul-17,2
Contemporary style hotel. Great location to step out of the hotel and roam the city. Professional and friendly service from employees who seemed to care about encounters with guests. We secured a good deal in a mini suite and liked the extra room and access to club level amenities.,30-Jul-17,5
"As a family of four, we made good use of the concierge lounge and we were glad to have it. The coffee, fruit, eggs and salmon were very good. Some items were below par, but we always found something we could enjoy. The service in the lounge was very gracious and accommodating. Overall, the hotel is excellent. The location is very good for exploring the city without a car, which is really the best way. Driving to the hotel was a nightmare, but that's just a fact of driving in the city. (Stockton doesn't go through, you have to go up Sutter, then left on Stockton). The parking is really expensive, so we parked for about half the cost across the street. Rooms are relatively small, but that's typical in a big city.",30-Jul-17,5
"I had a nice room on the 17th floor in the corner, and I had a view of the city and a peek of the ocean with boats/ships. I'm from S.F. originally and enjoyed visiting there seeing family, friends, a play, and shopping is an easy walk everywhere. Getting a ride is a cinch and was a happy camper!",30-Jul-17,4
This is a centrally located Hyatt and the breakfasts were amazing! Would definitely stay here again when we return to San Fran. We enjoyed the easy walk to local sites. The staff were very kind and welcoming. We liked the email notification that our room was ready!,29-Jul-17,5
"This hotel is well located adjunct to Union Square and surrounded by a lot of shops and restaurants. The rooms are clean and the bedding is excellent. The interconnecting doors are not sound proof so it is highly likely you will be woken if you are a light sleeper by the customers in adjunct rooms or the street traffic even if on a high floor room. The staff unfortunately, especially at checkin need training or perhaps retraining so that they are reminded that customers matter and in particular Hyatt members. The hotel lobby is small although there are seats to sit on one side of the hotel lobby. Staff seem to stand around and I saw little evidence of staff assisting customers apart from the doorman. Some of the hotel signage needs updating - we couldn't understand why we couldn't take the lift to the top level where we believed there was a restaurant. Apparently this has not been onsite for a long time but the signage remains. Customers couldn't find the restaurant on the mezzanine floor as once again the signage was not clear.",29-Jul-17,3
"Stayed here four times over the last couple of years and compared to other places I have stayed its the only place I actually look forward to staying in again. Its the small things really - the front desk and customer service generally are very good. The rooms are spacious, modern and well-laid out. Breakfasts are good, the restaurant is decent and the bar is quiet in the day and buzzing at night and serves good drinks. And the best bit is that hotel is just so convenient for everything. I look forward to my next visit.",27-Jul-17,5
"Elegant sleeping room, strong breakfast buffet, comfortable bar with OK but not exciting food, close to most attractions in San Francisco. The views from the workout room and the top floor are stunning",27-Jul-17,5
"We recently stayed here to be centrally located in San Francisco. The accommodations were nice for a Grand Hyatt, however what made this stay out of this world was the staffing. The concierge staff of Joanne, David, Mary and company were of this world. They made sure we had the best info to make our family vacation exceptional and then some how were able to get us same night reservations at places that had significant waits. Worth the stay as a Hyatt but worth more because of the staff.",26-Jul-17,5
"Location and view of union square was awesome! Clean, nice room. Will stay at Hyatt Grand in SF again. We only ate at the hotel once and the food was good. Very convenient pick up for Uber or walking to just about anywhere in SF.",26-Jul-17,4
"I loved the online check-in option at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. We received notification via email when our room was ready. This modern style hotel is located perfectly in the heart of San Francisco. We stayed in room 3411. The room was absolutely gorgeous. The high quality modern furniture made this room chic and comfortable, and the city skyline views were breathtaking. Housekeeping did an amazing job in keeping our room clean and comfortable. The staff at the Grand Club Lounge was very nice and breakfast was perfect, with plenty of delicious breakfast items to choose from.",25-Jul-17,5
"The hotel was nice but rooms are outdated. We had a good view of the town and some of the bay. Staff was friendly. We did not have any meals here. I probably would stay again but I would not be located next to the club bar, very noisy at all hours not worth the money it cost. Overpriced",25-Jul-17,3
We're active seniors in our 60's who are also SF Giants fans. Came into town to attend night game. Needed something convenient but not too expensive. To say that Hyatt SF met our expectations is an understatement. Hotel and staff were absolutely wonderful. Every single person across the spectrum of customer service made us feel welcome and special. This was our first experience here and we are trying to plan a return trip to catch a broadway show.,24-Jul-17,5
Very nice stay at Grand Hyatt SF. Good location in Union Square. Very nice and helpful staff including concierge. Try to upgrade or pay to use Lounge to save on having to go out for breakfast outside hotel. Also includes snacks light dinner and drinks in the afternoon and evening. ,23-Jul-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt was a dream. We stayed on a Saturday night after seeing a Giants game at AT&T park. The hotel is located close to public transportation, and the valet parking took care of our car allowing for an effortless arrival. The hotel itself is gorgeous with beautifully curated interiors and exceptional service. Every single one of the staff members was helpful and had a smile on their face, we felt very well taken care of. Our room was clean and we loved the modern finishes, and our view from the 24th floor was AMAZING. We were so enamored with the view out of our window that we decided to order room service and ate our dinner in the room looking out at the City below. Food was great and it was very convenient to have everything right there at your fingertips. This hotel is definitely in my top 3 favorite hotels of all time and I hope stay here again the next time I visit SF! ",23-Jul-17,5
There was no valet parking available on arrival; check-in was very slow - the person at the Globalist check-in line was on the phone; on-line check-in didn't work; neither did keyless room entry; I didn't receive housekeeping service the entire stay; it took over 30 mns to get my car back from valet parking; none of the bartenders knew how to mix classic cocktails; the food was low quality; the wifi was spotty and the drain in the bathtub was plugged. I stayed for 3 nights but only received credit in my World of Hyatt account for 2. This is simply a poor quality hotel on every level.,22-Jul-17,1
"Stayed here for 3 nights/4 days and was disappointed by the service and amenities. There was mold, dust, variable amenities, and chromcast doesn't work. See below for details.Day 1: Arrived and checked in just fine. Noticed there was no lotion so went out and bought some. Came back that night and noticed MOLD in our vents. We called the front desk expecting a new room but was told they could only clean the vent. So 10pm, maintenance comes in and spends 30mins cleaning and installing a new vent.Day 2: The room was not cleaned. We called downstairs to have supplies replenished. They were given a short list and did not deliver everything on the list. Day 3: Room was cleaned and lotion was left. So they just forgot to leave the lotion when we arrived... But they forgot to replenish the coffee. =/ I noticed a light dusting of dust on the nightstand. Thought it was just due to the turn down service. My friend and I began to cough more than usual when in the room and ONLY in the room. I noticed the dust was on every surface... If we have the newest cleanest vents, imagine how much worse it would be in any other room. Day 4: The windows were fogged up and would fog up minutes after we wiped it. Explains why they have mold in their vents.Really expected more from the Hyatt brand...They did not meet minimum standards for any hotel.",20-Jul-17,1
"Hyatt staff was attentive and caring. Room was clean, well appointed and in great condition. Great location for family fun as just steps from Union Square, cable cars, and great shopping. What else can I say, Hyatt does it right every time!",20-Jul-17,5
"I planned an event at the property and stayed during that week in the end of June. It was absolutely wonderful. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and very clean. The event space on the 36th floor is also incredibly special. You can actually go up there and look at the view when an event is not going on so I would highly recommend doing that.The staff are excellent! Nothing is too much trouble for them and they work very hard to make you happy. Several of my colleagues had drinks at the bar and had a great time. One of them also had breakfast in the restaurant and said it was great. I can personally recommend the room service as it was delicious and thankfully Grand Hyatt still serves room service on real plates, rather than to go boxes like some of the other hyatt brands.The hotel is within walking distance of anything you could possible need. You can walk to the ferry building in 30 minutes and union square is bustling with great restaurants and bars. Overall, I would highly recommend this property and we are looking to host this event again next year :).",20-Jul-17,5
"Fantastic location just off union square, close to all tour buses and multiple restaurants and shopping opportunities. Room was a great size with very comfortable bed. Great view from 20th floor, staff friendly, would definitely Return.",20-Jul-17,5
"The hotel was very very nice. Convenient to a lot of attractions that we were able to walk to. We parked our car and did not get it out until we left. We made use of the cable car system and taxis, much easier than taking our own vehicle.All personnel at the hotel were very knowledgeable and helpful.",19-Jul-17,5
"In general, they're great place to stay in terms of condition and location. One bad experience I had was they checked me out without my consent before the standard check-out time because when they tried to service my room, they saw that all of my stuff were no longer in the room and they assumed I had checked out. When I asked if this was even legal, they told me this was ""standard"" for hotels. For me, this was the 1st time I've heard of it.",17-Jul-17,4
"Room was ok but service wasnt. No one helped with my luggages upon arrival. No toiletries and water provided in the room, u have to call to request for it. Wifi wasnt working most of the time during my 2 nights stay. In-room dining was very expensive, there is even a delivery charge of USD5!!The only good thing is the location.The only good thing is the location.",17-Jul-17,3
"Clean, comfortable, spacious, stylish rooms and friendly staff. We liked the extra small hall and desk in the standard King room as it gave a good place to dress. Only negative was the sliding bathroom door that did not feel private.",16-Jul-17,5
"Stayed for 1 night only, although the hotel was nice and clean but still compared to money I have paid it did not exceed my expectation.stayed here for the brand name but I guess I have seen better for the star rating and price.overall experience was not so great; asked for cutlery in the room and after a couple of fake promises by a couple of different people (staff) the cutlery was finally delivered to my room almost an hour later since my first phone call. Took 2 phone calls and a visit to reception to get it. Apart from that room was nice, good view and a great location.",16-Jul-17,4
This is a great hotel just ask to be away from the Stockton St. side to avoid the overnight construction noise. Great front desk and restaurant staff. Gym has great view of SF skyline. Just get there early if you like your morning workouts.,16-Jul-17,4
"Stayed two nights at the Grand Hyatt on a recent business trip to San Francisco. Very good hotel in a simply awesome location in the city. Nice and comfortable rooms and bathroom. The Gym is on a high floor offering great views of the city. Staff is friendly and helpful. This is a large hotel with over 500 rooms, but has a really small restaurant for breakfast. This hotel does not fall in the Reasonably Priced' category.",16-Jul-17,4
The Hyatt was clean and very nice room. We were taken care ofd very well by the staff from checkin to checkout. The food was expensive but so is all of San Francisco. Overall great experience-the location is great in the heart of the city. .,15-Jul-17,5
"Great location! This hotel is right in the center of Union Square. Staff is super helpful. Rooms were spotless, room service was excellent, and views from room were perfect. Our driver, Ceasar, was amazing!",14-Jul-17,5
My wife and I recently stayed in a single king room. This is our second stay at this location. We were at the tail end of our California vacation with our family (SF/Tahoe) and I elected to get a room at Hyatt rather than impose on our son for accommodations at his apartment. Chose Union Square location due to proximity to son and ease of access to SFO the next day. Only looked at Hyatt properties when booking room.,13-Jul-17,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Union Square for 5 days for vacation while in San Francisco from Florida. This was our first visit to San Francisco and we were welcomed to the hotel like old friends. The doormen were so friendly and very accommodating in helping us get our luggage inside out of the cold and wind. Check in was very smooth- our flight arrived early and we were able to check in 4 hours early with no problem. The room was very spacious and comfortable. We had three people in our party and had 2 adjoining rooms. Ask for a higher floor to hear less of the noise from the street. We were on the 8th floor and didn't find the noise to be bothersome though. We did have two occasions to dine in the One Up Restaurant and it was superior! The food was great and the service was excellent. The staff was very friendly and really set themselves apart. We could also see that the staff worked well together as a team and that was nice to see. We did have some interaction with concierge named Anne and she helped us book a fantastic city tour, tour to Muir Woods, gave us restaurant recommendations, and booked our airport shuttle. She was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel has a wonderful resource in her. I should add that we were also able to use Uber very easily for pick ups and drop offs at the hotel. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. If you stay here, you will be very pleased!",13-Jul-17,5
Great hotel with a great location and view! I got a room Union Square face and I did not regret!5 - Room.4- Management.5 - Cleaning4 - Wifi5 - Location4 - Bathroom5 - ConciergeDo recommend this hotel when going to San Francisco. Great bar and Concierge!,12-Jul-17,5
"Condition of bathroom is bad and not clean at all. When I took a shower, the water didn't drain well so I need call the service. However the location is great and convenient to walk around the union square and go to shopping. ",12-Jul-17,3
"Lovely, helpful staff, concierge always helpful. Clean rooms, great location.Drinks expensive but you expect that in hotels, little cafe at back door very reasonabley pricedWould definitely recommend",12-Jul-17,5
"The hotel was nice, room was wonderful. However the gym was tiny and could not accommodate the number of guests at the hotel. At 8am on Saturday and Sunday, every single treadmill or other equipment was occupied, as was all available floor space. Really left no workout option, which was a huge disappointment for a nice business hotel.",12-Jul-17,3
"Great Location very close to China Town, Union Square, Market St most things are walking distance and Bell Staff were great when needing transport. In comparison to other Hyatts I have stayed in the service and staff friendliness was average. on a positive note we were able to access our room on arrival which was great as we had a 14 hour flight from Australia and were able to shower and change our clothes, this was a big plus. The rooms were clean and coffee machine is provided, we are tea drinkers and on request you can have a kettle and tea provided, the tea wasnt restocked daily and we purchased our own coffee and milk.",12-Jul-17,3
"This is our second time staying at the Grand Hyatt Union Square. The hotel is perfectly positioned, with a Union Square basically on your door step. A room with Union Square view is a must. The rooms were large, very clean with great amenities. The service was faultless. Close to restaurants, shops, cafes the trolley and tour buses. Highly recommend this hotel.",11-Jul-17,5
"My wife and I were offered an upgraded room at the reduced rate. We had two rooms at the hotel because my son was also attending. We accepted the offer but was charged the full room rate which I discovered reviewing my travel credit card charges. The hotel refused to honor the discount request and we were moved back to original reservation. My error was not asking to ""sign off"" on roommate before verbal acceptance. We expected hotel to honor discount offered by staff,",11-Jul-17,1
"Hotel staff were great and the location is perfect!!!!! Great views, nice fitness center. Surprisingly parking is available across the street in a well maintained garage for a $36 daily rate which is not bad at all.",10-Jul-17,5
"Good central location, fairly quite street noice. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. This was our second trip to the Grand Hyatt downtown and we will definitely return. Only downside to our stay, hallway noice was a little loud with children running up and down. ",10-Jul-17,4
Updated hotel with an even better location! Close enough to walk to AT&T park for a Giants game! Literally steps to Union Square and shops! The staff was also super friendly!! I will definitely stay here again!!!,10-Jul-17,5
"I am kind of new to Hyatt, and I really like this one. Got a good rate for a work trip, even in a run of house room everything was well appointed. I appreciate very much the Hyatt brand touch to leave that card in your room specifying what they have and can send up. It's at the point now where all you really need is to pack clothes and they'll take care of the rest. I loved the bar on the mezzanine level - make sure you're there when Boa is working, he is an absolute doll. Minus one star really only because some of the furnishings in the rooms look well loved, but really other than that it's a top spot. And less than a block from Boba Guys is always alright in my book. The CVS across the street is a little sketch, but you know what folks... it's SF. You have to manage the sketchy parts of the city basically anywhere you go.",10-Jul-17,4
"This is a great location and within walking distance to a lot of sight seeing sites. It is a huge hotel. The rooms are large. We had two double beds and four of us (2 adults and 2 kids) were very comfortable.You should go to the 43rd floor and enjoy a cocktail and the view.I was disappointment when I found out that they offered me a room with a view and failed to mention that there was an extra charge with it. At the check out they were very understanding and removed the extra charge. Also, the cleaning crew didn't do a good job vacuuming or clean my room. I was there for 5 nights.",10-Jul-17,4
Location was great and staff was helpful. perhaps it was the part of the hotel I was in but you can hear everything from guests next door and you can constantly hear the elevators going up and down. the bath tub was noisy as if the part of the floor was broken.,10-Jul-17,4
"We chose the GRAND HYATT SAN FRANCISCO, 1st because of the brand assurance, 2nd because of its location. just steps away from UNION SQUARE, and the heart of the city, you can't ask for more, everything is literally walking distance.Check-in was quick, the family room was a bit tiny, but well you can't have everything. The hotel staff is super cooperative, & are more than willing to help out with directions etc.,For a tourist in the city, GRAND HYATT is perfect! would definitely recommend it!",9-Jul-17,3
"I stayed st this hotel for 2 nights with a colleague of mine (I made the reservations for the both of us) and once she entered her room she sent me a message saying ValÃ©rie well done this hotel is amazing and the room are spacious!I loved this hotel very close to Union- Square and very closed distance form ChinaTown Gates.The room are spacious and I even have a vanity corner in mine.OneUP restaurant is very good we just went for breakfast! You won't be disappointed! Top- notched place HÃ´tel trÃ¨s bien placÃ© prÃ¨s de Union Square, Le personnel est sympa, Le restaure OneUP pour le petit dÃ©jeuner est top!Le Quartier Chinois est Ã  moins de 7min Ã  pieds.L'hÃ´tel est trÃ¨s classe @valerie.travelprints",8-Jul-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt is centrally located in San Francisco, right on Union Square. When visiting, we either walk or take the Muni. Muni stops are less than a block away, for a quick ride to North Beach, shopping on Union Street or Filmore Street, or to the SFMOMA. Take stroll down to Market Street to catch the trolley to the Ferry Building or to Fisherman's Wharf. Or just stay around the hotel for great shopping.",8-Jul-17,5
"We loved our stay. The checkin was quick, but they said they would text me when my room was ready but they never did. The room itself was gorgeous. Lots of pillows and towels. Lots of places for luggage. The city view was spectacular. The blinds were automatic which was neat. I have nothing too negative to say. The bell hop was the oldest Hyatt employee and he was so funny and charming. Loved him. Don't know why we cant go to the 36th floor, that was disappointing since we thought drinks and a view would be nice. The location itself was perfect. We Ubered everywhere which worked out great. We enjoyed our stay. ",7-Jul-17,5
"Enjoyed 3 nights on the concierge level, floor 32. I was extremely surprised at the extent and quality of food and beverage offering in the club. It was much more than a continental breakfast, there were eggs, sausage, bacon, etc. The evening offerings were just as good, with nice a nice selection and honor bar.. Room was extremely clean, housekeeping did a very nice job. Definitely would stay here again. Oh- and the front desk was won wonderfully helpful and charming!",7-Jul-17,5
"Loved my stay at the Grand Hyatt Union Square. It was a great location could walk to everything. Very friendly staff and great accommodations. The room was very nice, clean and Loved the bathroom and shower as well as the very comfortable bed. Highly recommend to everyone who likes an excellent hotel in a perfect location. won't disappoint. Satisfied guest, Jo Tuzzolino",7-Jul-17,5
"This is a somewhat dated property with some nice modern touches and an excellent location. A lot of the 4 star hotels in SF would not be 4 star hotels elsewhere (see my other review), but I would say the Grand Hyatt is appropriately rated at 4 stars. Overall good experience. Here is what I liked and didn't like...Pros:-friendly, helpful, accommodating, wonderful staff (reception, housekeeping, etc.)-very good location, easy to get in and out of hotel-although guest rooms are a bit dated and on the small side, hotel has added modern touches such as motorized window shades, USB ports, frosted glass doors, etc.-comfortable bed and linens (king bed with 6 pillows)-updated, modern, welcoming lobby (which is set up ""living room-style"" like Andaz hotels instead of traditional big front desk)-ice machines and water coolers on each floor-room service from 6am to midnight (see additional comments below)-check-out time is noon (many hotels are 11am) and they had no problem giving me a late checkout. like I said, very nice, helpful staff and this goes a long way-CVS right across the street is very convenient-Safe location (which is not something that can be said about quite a few SF hotels)Cons:-as mentioned above, guest rooms are a bit dated and selection of artwork is odd-room service menu is limited and somewhat bland menu so i decided to call the restaurant directly to see if there were other choices. There were, and some good ones, and the prices were much less than on the room service menu. You just have to order on the phone and go pick it up on the second floor. I can understand the hotel charging more for room service items OR charging a delivery fee but not both, and why limit the menu to just a few items?-Like so many Hyatts, access to the balconies has been closed off, which means you cannot get any outside air in the room.-Insulation between rooms is not great, mainly because of door to adjoining room. Given how few guests probably request adjoining rooms, the hotel should consider eliminating some of these doorsOverall I think this hotel is a great choice in SF.",6-Jul-17,4
We stayed at this property during the long weekend. We had a lovely suite with great views of the city. The hotel is very clean and rooms are spacious. The bathroom was big. The lounge at the hotel had great selection for breakfast and evening hor'dorvors. The quality and variety of food is very good. They also had a good selection of wine and cheese every evening. We loved our stay at the hotel. The location is perfect ,5-Jul-17,5
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The people on the club level are very helpful. Good food and best three dollar glass of wine on the west coast. Sufficient proteins for two meals a day. The rooms are updated and clean. Comfortable beds. Sadly, the sidewalks of San Francisco have become an open sewer, with human feces smeared around and the pungent smell of urine everywhere. The Hyatt maintains the area in front of their building quite well, but the rest of the city needs a good power washing once a week.",5-Jul-17,5
"Decent location and comfy bed but not worthy of the Hyatt name or price tag. In room bathroom is not at all private. It is a sliding frosted glass door that is directly across from the entry door to the room. It doesn't close all the way, does not lock, and there is no fan to drown out personal noise. The in room fridge is behind a cabinet door which prevents the fridge from closing completely, which we didn't figure out until after our food spoiled. I also had a major issue with gift cards that is still not rectified. While it is not the fault of this location, I felt they could do SOMETHING to recognize the issue and attempt to rectify it. But.... nothing was even acknowledged.",5-Jul-17,2
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF in Union Square for one night. It's a very nice property that is centrally-located and within walking distance to many attractions in SF. I was provided a room on the 31st floor with southern views of SF looking out across Union Square. It was a very nice room with contemporary furnishings (see pics). As it seems with most Grand Hyatt's though, it's a very busy hotel. However, being only 1/2-block from Union Square, this is not unexpected. The Regency Club is located on the 32nd floor and serves a very nice, fully-inclusive breakfast. ",4-Jul-17,4
"The Grand Hyatt at Union Square - located in the heart of shops and restaurants and so much more. Rooms are comfortable and views from all sides of the hotel are good. We overlooked Union Square and enjoyed people watching and checked to see if any activities were taking place. The room shades block most of the sunlight and I do love the fact you can control the shades and lights from your bed. I am always amazed at how the personnel at the Grand Hyatt at Union Square are always polite, attentive and knowledgeable. We enjoyed access to the Club Room - Judy, Warren, Jimmy, Ben, Anh, David, Jessica and Billy always greeted us by name - they cleared and cleaned the tables, replenished the food and still made time to check on us and see how we were doing. Yes this hotel is near the construction of the new transportation system and yes it can get noisy but after a day of walking, exploring the de Young museum, botanical gardens, taking the cable car, visiting Chinatown and shopping - you return exhausted and sleep oblivious to the night sounds of San Francisco. ",4-Jul-17,5
"We always have a wonderful stay at this property. Love the location adjacent to Union Square and Chinatown. Not a long walk to many of the SF sites. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and our breakfasts in the hospitality room were always lovely. The room was ""fine"" - nothing spectacular - and our only complaint is that our shower head in the bathroom was positioned so close to the water spigot that you had to stand practically against the metal to wash your whole body. But better than many hotels I've stayed in this summer that only have a rain shower option overhead, which isn't good for me when I don't want to wash my hair!",4-Jul-17,5
"Disappointing stay at the Hyatt. I have stayed at this hotel several times before and this time not so good. I am a Hyatt member which clearly bears no added advantage. Was put on the 3 rd floor where the street noise is quite loud. Bed was squeeky, aircon rattled, no mini bar or water bottles provided. The bath also was weak on the base of the the bath which made you feel like you were going to fall through it. Vanity basin chipped .Requested a paper which never arrived. Not what you expect from a hotel of this kind. The concierge desk offered great service but the check in and check out staff were very underwhelming. Also, always have to wait as they are not efficient. Had a meal at the bar and asked for more bread with my soup. What was delivered was a stale bread roll.I gave feedback at the checkout when I was asked how my stay was. Care factor,very little.Will go to the westin around the corner next time.",3-Jul-17,1
"Best value on Union Square for the quality level that is expected of a Grand Hyatt hotel. We spent the week-end and did not have to use our car until the last day. Park across the street at the Sutter-Stockton garage if you have to park overnight, it is half the price of what the hotel charges for parking. Club level rooms will give you access to the club lounge which has an excellent brunch and light dinner appetizers and wine/beer in the evening, throughout the day there is fruit and cookies and drinks (non-alcoholic) available. No compromise on quality or level of service here!",3-Jul-17,5
Staff is courteous and doormen were always smiling. In fact most people that live here smile a lot! Rooms were good with many towels. Its expensive to park overnight so be aware. Its actually expensive to park in San Francisco! This hotel is near shops and there is a starbucks's right across the street. Taxis were easy to get. We spent a lot of time down on the waterfront.,2-Jul-17,4
"Terrific location, and friendly professional staff, but the room furnishings need some upgrade! And the noise levels are ""high"" both from the Elevator and the streets. They even provide 2 Sets of Ear Plugs in each room! !",1-Jul-17,3
"Wanting to visit this beautiful city before a cruise, we picked the Grand Hyatt because of its location to so many different areas. Very close walk to BART and not that far of a walk to Embarcadero and the piers. ",30-Jun-17,5
"Have stayed at this location several times. Enjoy being able to walk to shopping, restaurants and theater. Great location. This is a great city to visit both historical sites and recreational activities.",30-Jun-17,5
"Grand Hyatt is in an excellent location, everywhere that you want to be is an easy walk from here, the dÃ©cor is very Hyatt beige with touches of dark timber, as you see all over the world, that is ok as it is understated and not too in your face, rooms are big, bathrooms are comfortable, views from most rooms are great, we had a club room on 22nd floor, the club lounge is on the 32nd floor, quite lounge with spectacular views over the city, the club staff are amazing, nothing is a problem for them, I think that this is a great city hotel with excellent service, no negatives from me.",29-Jun-17,4
The staff is generally not very polite and doesn't have not much patience during check-on and when we called front desk for questions. Great location at Union Squrewith walkable distance to China town. Assisted self-parking is in a parking structure across street next to CVS with $35/24 hr with in and out privileges. Breakfast buffet is $32 with omelette and other selections. ,29-Jun-17,3
"We could not have asked for better service. From the attentive door men to the fabulous concierge and front desk, I'm not sure which was better. They were all great and would highly recommend staying here. Our room was comfortable and well stocked. The beds and pillows were comfy. The bathroom was modern and had plenty of light. This was our first trip to the city and would stay here again. Great location. Give the Grand Hyatt a try when in SAN Francisco. ",29-Jun-17,5
"The location is absolutely awesome. The room is ok with good bed, sheets and pillows. But bath has curtains instead of glass doors. In a hotel like this, I really was expecting a better finishing. The hotel service lacked attention to me. I have received a package from Amazon, and the hotel did not call me to say the package has arrived. I almost forgot it there. The restaurant is ok, nothing more.",28-Jun-17,3
The Hotel is in a very good location to restaurants bars etc the view from the high rooms are fabulous we had a room on the 18th Floor looking over San Francisco Bay the Hotel is very well organised our room was maintained to a high standard in addition you are fairly close to all attractions that you would want to see in San Francisco either walking bike riding or cable car would definitely stay here if we ever returned just remember bring a good pair of trainers for walking you need them as there are many very very steep hills ,27-Jun-17,5
"This is a great hotel. The decor is fantastic and the rooms are really nice. The bathrooms are well laid out and modern. Nice sheets, pillows and towels. Breakfast was a little bit cramped as only one side operating when we visited but the selection was good. Definitely stay here again. ",26-Jun-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco was well located with shopping, parks, and restaurants nearby. Staff was very responsive in correcting a problem with our room early on in our trip and checked back several times.",26-Jun-17,5
Hands down the best hotel I have stayed at. From the staff to the food to the quality to the views. Don't waste your time elsewhere and go to the grand hyatt. It is so centeral to every other part of the city that you will find that you can do more simply because they make it easier. I will be going back.,26-Jun-17,5
"clean/nice rooms but registration and needs a actual line set up. location was in the city but very noisy, view was of a dirty rooftop. did not have time to eat or enjoy any other amenities. I would stay there again if needed.",26-Jun-17,4
"This hotel was quite nice. I was in a Grand Club room and it was quite comfortable. The Club room allows access to the Grand Club Lounge, where they have breakfast (which was excellent, by the way), appetizers with honor bar, and then is open later for dessert too. Access to the lounge comes with this level of room, and the food is complementary. Honor bar drinks are probably lowest cost in the city - glass of wine $3 and mixed drinks $4. The night that we came for ""appetizers"" they had fried chicken, mac and cheese, slaw, among other veggies and dips, etc. The food was amazing and we didn't even need dinner that night, it was delicious. The food at the Hotel bar is also excellent. Staff here is great. We spoke with the manager on duty (Steven Reyes) about an issue we had and he was super nice and solved everything for us. He was extremely respectful and the nicest hotel manager I've ever encountered. I would definitely go back to this hotel, and would stay in a Club Room again just for the access to the Club Lounge - best in SF.",25-Jun-17,5
"Actually, this was my first experience at a Hyatt anywhere for number of years. My experience is what I expected â€“ overall excellent. While the overall architecture and the rooms are very modern, the service and professionalism of the staff is what you would expect from an old world hotel. ",25-Jun-17,5
"Most companies, banks etc are removing computers in welcome areas or hiding them, not this hotel! The first thing that strikes you is the bank of the large apple computers and staff literally hidden behind them....unfortunately our clerk didnt have an enthusiasm to overcome it!Hotel is ok, really convenient for union sq, next to Apple ..... maybe that's where the computers came from! Room is standard fare but no mini bar? An empty fridge, coffee machine in a drawer, and no milk? Gym has a good view but small, the stretching mats are actually in the lift lobby there wasn't enough room in the weights area to for two of us one had to wait. It's ok, convenient and just a bit predictable. No one when we arrived or left seemed bothered that we there. Never mind, there's plenty of choice in SF!",24-Jun-17,3
"The Grand Hyatt is a luxury hotel. The rooms are large and well appointed, the staff friendly and the location is excellent. Having stayed in a number of different hotels in San Francisco over the years, I can say without reservation that the Grand Hyatt is one of the best places in the city.",23-Jun-17,5
"It was a pleasant surprise the quality of the service offered by this hotel, everything was perfect! I usually stay at Hyatt hotels, but this one surpasses my expectations, with a high standard service.The place the hotel is located is amazing, our bedroom was located on a high floor and the view was simply breathtaking.The breakfast was incredible and the service was outstanding. All the attendants there were always ready to help us with a smile on their faces.The concierge Elaine was very helpful and promptly give us instructions on how to get to Fisherman wharf, walking through Chinatown and little Italy, which I never thought I could do, but it was a delightful experience, fulfilled with new discoveries. The price was fair and really worth the value.We really had a great time, and certainly Grand Hyatt Union Square will be our choice on our next trip to San Francisco.",22-Jun-17,5
"I booked this hotel by mistake, meant to book the Hyatt Regency! Overall it was an average stay, whilst the room was clean & comfortable, it didn't have the usual amenities I was used to (like the basic toiletries, mini bar, etc). No breakfast buffet so had to order room service which was so overpriced. Staff were not overly friendly, my check-in seemed very abrupt & rushed. But the hotel is in a good location right by Union Square.",21-Jun-17,3
"I had not been to this hotel in five years, so it was a pleasant surprise, to see they remodeled it. The rooms were ample, with good beds and pleasant views.The bathrooms although remodeled, are small but sufficient for couples or singles.",21-Jun-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt is a solid hotel in an excellent location near Union Square. My room was pretty ordinary, and had an odd dearth of outlets-I had to charge two devices in the bathroom. Apart from that, the smallish room was clean and fine.Service was good, and the hotel restaurant offers a good, though pricey, breakfast.",21-Jun-17,3
"It's likely that if I had paid the $350/night for four nights in cash instead of credit card points that I might have given the hotel only three dots instead of four. I guess being a little richer leaves me in an equitable mood. Don't get me wrong; it's a very nice hotel. Doormen, fancy restaurant/bar, spacious lounge area, concierge. It gives quite a fine impression. The room was clean and smelled good. I like the modern styling. But it's not very big. There are no dresser drawers besides three very small ones in the closet (I don't like living out of a suitcase for four days). The large blind that covers the sliding glass doors at night was a mystery until we found an unlabeled controller button halfway across the room next to the bed. Convenient, but we just got lucky figuring it out. The sink is needlessly weird and high. The tub was fiberglass/plastic (!) and had spots that pushed down a little when I stepped on them making an audible pop. The surface-mounted sliding bathroom door didn't fit tightly, allowing light and (ahem) noises out. These are all very, very minor issues. It's still a very nice hotel. Most other hotels with these piddly complaints would get five dots from me. But not any that charge $350/night or more. I'm sorry but even in San Francisco if I'm paying that much, I better be blown completely away. That room should be perfect in every possible way. Chocolates on the bed. Complimentary wine in the fridge. Maybe discounts on local attractions. I don't know - surprise me. That's what $350/night hotels do.",20-Jun-17,4
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco was all that I wanted it to be and more. The staff were friendly, efficient, and hospitable. The room was beautiful - as was the view - and the slippers and robe in the closet were comfortable and luxurious. The Grand Lounge provided delicious breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres with great service and a comfortable environment. Can't wait to go back!",20-Jun-17,5
"Location! Fabulous Beds, staff, breakfast. You can open a window (door) even on 27th floor! Our favorite hotel for SF visits, after trying a lot of others. Great views, easy to get everywhere with Bart, Muni, cable car, walking.",20-Jun-17,5
My husband and I stayed at the GH-San Francisco for six nights for my husband's 40th birthday. From the moment we walked through the doors the staff was very attentive to our needs. We were always met with a friendly smile and they went out of their way to help us.,20-Jun-17,5
"I stay in SF about once a month. I love to try new hotels and restaurants, but I always come back to this hotel. It has a great location, renovated rooms (now without the annoying rollerball TV controls), and a really comfortable bar with big screens and a great staff, a good gym and an improved Club Level experience with great views. Reception staff is great despite the fact that no one honors the dedicated World of Hyatt line - this has been the case at every Hyatt I have stayed over the past five years- crazy! Things to know - parking in SF is crazy. Valet it and take Uber or public transit. Room service is limited - to be expected in a city where you can order any kind of food to be delivered in minutes! This hotel is frequently booked by large groups, but I am amazed how they seem to manage it!I plan to go back next month!!",19-Jun-17,4
I paid $430 for a king bed and one night as a treat. The hotel was close to my meeting. I'm not a fan of the open concept reception desk. I couldn't tell who was staff and who was guest. The room service staff did a good job but brought me a strawberry jam previously used and opened. I'm surprised the staff let that get by. The room was nicely updated and sleek. The bell staff was wonderful. They loaded my luggage into my rental car long after I had checked out. The location is prime.,19-Jun-17,4
"Sheri at ""In-House"" reservations was very polite, calm & accomodating to my last minute change in travel. Hotels have 48 hour cancellation policies and due to death with an employees family member I was not able to travel.",19-Jun-17,5
"I requested through front desk that a cork and wine glasses to be delivered to my room, front desk said that the request would be relayed to room service. However, nothing happened because the requested items were never delivered. Very poor customer service.",19-Jun-17,2
"Wonderful hotel, in the heart of San Fran and very convenient to restaurants, ferry building, fisherman's wharf and cable car, etc. Lovely views from the higher floors. Wish they would bring back the 36th floor lounge!! Great staff, helpful and willing to please! Housekeeping was terrific!",19-Jun-17,5
"I stayed at double double room with the reasonable price which I would not stay once again. This was because this room was surrounded other three rooms and I had no other choice but to hear door shutting sound and neighbors' squeaking sound from the floor all night. I didn't imagine this type of room at this level of hotel. Otherwise, I had no other complaints.",18-Jun-17,4
"I have stayed at this property many times, and always return. Great, courteous service, and comfortable, clean rooms, are a standard. Location is perfect for exploring San Francisco, and surrounding areas. The Grand Club is one of the best in the Hyatt chain, providing breakfast and lite dinner fair. All-around great property. ",18-Jun-17,5
"Arrived early and reception staff checked us in without hassle. Stayed for 5 nights. Room had a good view, clean & good size. However, door in room should be fixed, as needed to close forcefully to lock properly. Great location central to many restaurants/shopping/transport. Max the bell-hop was friendly & helpful. Worth the price and will stay here again & recommend this hotel to everyone!",17-Jun-17,4
"Very nice interior, lots of things to take advantage of in the area. Apple store next door, right at Union Square. Hotel staff are very friendly, and there are lots of food and other options in the general area.",16-Jun-17,5
Have been here several times but best visit was over holidays. Very nice hotel overall and convenient to Union Square. High up rooms can be noisy if suites rented have parties. Concierge is a great help,15-Jun-17,4
"Great location, lots of food options around. Easy to commute around the city. Very central location. Top end hotel, great service and the restaurant is awesome. Parking is close, one block away. Good for business or famly trip",14-Jun-17,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 4 nights in early June.Overall, the stay was ok, but for the price point and on a business trip, I can't rate this anything above poor.For the positives, the room was nice, the staff cleaned it well, and the staff was generally very friendly. The gym on the 35th floor had a good mix of weights and cardio.A small negative was more than once, I was left a pile of decaffeinated coffee and only 1 or 0 packs of regular coffee. A small detail, but for the price point, I would expect this detail to be hit.The significant negative experience was the hotel Wi-Fi. There was an outage my 2nd night and 1st and 3rd mornings, which isn't great. The real bad experience here is that guests have to call the IT team directly, instead having the concierge tackle it, who then take you through a tier 1 support script (have you restarted your device, etc).The first time, the IT rep arranged a restart of the router, which fixed things. When I told this to the rep on the 2nd incident, he was a bit incredulous that he couldn't do that/arrange that.For the price point, I expect Wi-Fi to be solid and not to have to do 30 min+ of IT desk calls myself.",14-Jun-17,2
"Very nice room with city views, quiet and comfortable, great location for many activities in SF-- shopping, restaurants, theatre. Parking rather expensive, however, and in-room food not great. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable.",13-Jun-17,4
"I am currently staying at the Grand Hyatt for 4 nights. The view of Union square from my room is nice. The room is fine although the bathroom oversized sink takes up all the counter space and the shower head is pitiful: Tiny and not enough pressure. Just like the wifi. And that's the main issue with this hotel for business travelers: The wifi is free but you get what you pay for and it's definitely not adequate for business use. It is not powerful enough to allow stable VPN connection into my company network. It keeps connecting and disconnecting. This is my second (and last) visit to this hotel. The same thing happened 2 months ago: I could not connect to the wifi. Had to run to the Marriott across the street to send emails. No issues there. I thought it was a fluke. Nope. Apparently, that's normal as nothing improved despite both myself and a colleague reporting the same issue. She was told to go work in the business center. (I actually tried that, but it didn't work for me). And I didn't even get as much as a follow up message from the front desk. Going to the Marriott to send emails right now ...",13-Jun-17,2
"Room was not functional. Poor counter space in the bathroom and dirty shower upon arrival. Given the $300/night price, I expected more from this hotel. I do have to mention that it is gross to wake up with half your body on the mattress because they don't have fitted sheets. ",13-Jun-17,1
"We stayed 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt, and it was very nice. We had a problem with our first room, but the Manager was helpful in giving us another room as well as a credit on our bill. I would recommend getting a Grand Club room, as you can recoup the price difference by visiting the lounge several times. The breakfast in the lounge was very good. The hotel is centrally located near Union Square and it is easy to travel to nearby sights as well as the BART train.",12-Jun-17,4
"My partner and I stayed here for five nights. The hotel has many pluses. Its location, in the center of the Union Square area, provided easy access to San Francisco--there's lots of shopping nearby and good access to public transportation. My partner's conference was at the Moscone Center, and the hotel was within walking distance of that venue (though not the closest property). The style of the hotel was in-keeping with Hyatt--clean and modern. We were in a lovely corner room with a spacious bathroom and great views of the city. The room had plenty of plugs in convenient locations. The lighting was good. The hotel provided the most complete set of toiletries I've ever seen--we even had after-sun lotion and face wash! They were a high quality brand, and I appreciated the extra touches.I am a Hyatt 'Globalist' and we were thus provided access to the Grand Club. The morning continental offering was lovely--lots of healthy options and a beautiful set-up. While the lounge was busy, it appeared right-sized; I never struggled to find a table. The evening offering in the lounge was more standard--a few light appetizers. No complaints, but nothing remarkable. I've seen better evening offerings and I've seen worse.The staff at the hotel was approachable and helpful in all instances. We arrived very early and a room wasn't yet ready. The hotel sent us a text message when it was ready, which was a nice touch. Front desk staff, bell staff, and housekeeping staff were all very welcoming.The hotel's fitness center, on the top floor, has great views! It's small, but had nice equipment and, for its size, a good selection of cardio equipment and weights. Certainly nice to not be trapped in a basement while you use the treadmill, etc.The major issue with the hotel was noise. I am not typically sensitive to noise, nor I am a particularly light sleeper. The noise at this property very negatively affected my stay and my quality of sleep. In this regard, two complaints: first, the doors of the guest rooms SLAM shut. Throughout the night, whenever someone entered or exited a room, you could hear everything...slam, slam, slam. Second, the walls are paper-thin: we could hear every conversation had by our neighbors (which, of course, means they could hear every conversation of ours), and when they returned after a late night out, there was no insulation from their rather noisy recantation of that night out (and, while I wish they had been quieter, they were not being especially disrespectful or loud--the walls are just paper thin). Similarly, in the morning, you could hear the activities of housekeepers in the hallways--talking, going in and out of rooms (tap, tap, tap...door slam), etc. For a hotel of this quality and price point (several hundred dollars a night), being constantly awaken or distributed by noise was very, very disappointing.While the style of the accommodation and helpfulness of the staff would not drive me away completely, I would have difficulty returning to this or recommending this hotel due to the noise issues.",11-Jun-17,3
On the 25th floor great views of the Financial district. Found staff to be very friendly and willing to assist if required. The cafÃ© cart set up in the lobby for breakfast snack to 11am was excellent. Bar staff helpful and nice range of bar snack menu on offer. Only complaint is the banging of the bedroom doors(but you get that in most hotels).,9-Jun-17,4
"I read a lot of negative reviews on this hotel, so I thought I would share my recent experience (7-night stay) and offer some perspective. Yes, this is San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities to live in or visit in the country, so any visitor should expect to pay more than they would almost anywhere else in the U.S. So, do I feel like I got the same 'value' as I would in a similar hotel in a less expensive city? Yes, absolutely. Check-in was a pleasant experience, and we ended up with a great room on a higher floor with a wonderful view of Union Square. We didn't experience a lot of noise from guests next to us or above us - it happened a few times, but it was nothing major. We did also hear the 'creaks' that some others have mentioned as part of the way the building was constructed, but again, it certainly didn't keep us up at night. The room was significantly larger than many other rooms in SF, particularly since we had double beds. Beds were extremely comfortable.Housekeeping was good, but I will admit, not perfect. We had to request toilet tissue one evening, which was delivered fairly promptly. However, that happened two more times during our stay. The housekeeping staff were courteous and friendly, always greeting us in the hallways. Doormen were extremely pleasant and I think I only opened 2-3 doors my entire stay. Concierge staff went out of their way to assist and provide maps and offer personal recommendations. The only time that the service was merely 'serviceable' was at check-out - that transaction was perfunctory at best.We did not use the hotel restaurant, but did use the cafÃ© near the Concierge area for breakfast one morning, which was very convenient for the day we needed quick coffee and breakfast sandwiches to fuel up for our day trip to wine country.Other than the small housekeeping issues, the only other issue I would note is that the elevators could be a little slow, but I've certainly experienced worse. Also, I'd have liked another drawer or two for our belongings, but that could just be that we overpacked!The hotel is in a fantastic location, and it was an easy walk to everything in Union Square, or over to Chinatown and down to the border of SoMa. Uber/Lyft options are plentiful. Lots of cafes, restaurants and bars within a 2-3 block radius. Cable car access within a block and other transit a 5-minute walk to Market Street.All in all, the hotel met or exceeded our expectations, and although I normally seek out smaller, boutique hotels, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",8-Jun-17,4
This was the perfect hotel for me. Central to a lot of attractions. The walk to most attractions was about a mile and a half. Good exercise. Hotel breakfast was very good. Next door to Union square and all modes of transportation are there.,8-Jun-17,5
I am terrible at reviewing anything and putting it into words. But the grand Hyatt San Francisco is way over priced for what you get. I wish we would of looked at the Marriott that was right across the street. I'll never stay at this hotel again..,6-Jun-17,1
The hotel is in a central location but for the price the rooms are average particularly the bathroom. Within walking distance or tram or short uber ride to all the major tourist attractions. The hotel staff were friendly but very busy. The hotel lifts were extreamly busy and you can wait upto 5 minutes. Would recommend this hotel though for business travellers. ,6-Jun-17,3
The hotel is expectionally clean and all staff members were friendly and kind! This is our favorite place to stay in San Francisco.This amazing experience starts at check in and will keep you smiling until check out.,6-Jun-17,5
"May 30, 2017 Dear Mr. Paul Devitt, I was a previous hotel guest (May 26-29, 2017) from the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. I would like to inform you that my family had a blast staying at your hotel. We really liked the design and the atmosphere in the hotel especially the location- near to everything. Our stay will not be completed without your respectful, courteous staff that we had encountered especially the greeter (outside the hotel). They always greet us with a smile even how cold it was outside. We really appreciate for making our stay so memorable. But on 05.23.2017 (8:49 pm â€“ TEXAS time/ 6:49 pm- CA time), I called the hotel (Front Desk) to asked her about the package/gift that my friend left me in the Front Desk on Saturday. I asked her if she can check it, but she did transfer me to the lost and found. That item is not considered lost and found, I even have a ticket # in reference to it. So, I called again and asked to be transfer to Front Desk. I spoke to her or maybe another Front Desk Associate (not sure if the same girl or another one), asked to her to checked my package again and provided the reference #. She asked me, if whatâ€™s inside the bag and I told her, I do not know since my friend, didnâ€™t say any detail about it. Then she told, the items like chips and heavy fish stuff (I am not sure), then I asked if she can send it to my place, since I am back in TX. Then she told, just stop by and pick it up, but I told her, I am back in TX. So, I asked her again, can you please send it to my place and I will pay for it, and then she answered, â€œIT WILL COST YOU A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE IT IS HEAVY,â€ù and then, I answered her, it doesnâ€™t really matter. With her statement, I felt so belittle and disrespected by her, why because I am have an accent or I am asking too much? Or maybe sheâ€™s just being racist. In the first place, I am not asking the hotel to pay for it and I told her I will pay it. She doesnâ€™t have the right to tell me those words because it is my money, in the first place and because those are gifts, which means those are important to me. I stayed to your hotel because my friendâ€™s reception (wedding) will be there. And I thought staying in a luxury and expensive hotel, will provide me a quality customer service but itâ€™s not. After the front desk, I called concierge and I spoke to Joy (not sure her name), since the front desk told me she will be coordinating with Concierge but the concierge, just transferred me without telling me, which department she will be transferring me and another with attitude. Just a courtesy, the guest should be informed to which department she/he will be transferred. These employees should know how to act properly because their representing your brand, which is Grand Hyatt. But I guess, they donâ€™t care because even their supervisor, Mr. Flores, acts the same with them. Maybe thatâ€™s why your staff acts like that because they can see it from their supervisor. I deserve a respect it doesnâ€™t matter is I am paying guest or non-paying guest. I donâ€™t deserve to be belittled by somebody. You hotel is nice and I bet you have great employees but these 3 rude employees can rotten the good ones and poison their minds. I just hope that these employees will be thankful because theyâ€™re working in a good company and I hope they will return that favor to the company and especially with the+ir guests and colleagues. By the way, even concierge (Joy, I think), sheâ€™s rude to the security employee too thatâ€™s why he called the Shift Front Desk Manger (Andrea) to inform her about the incident. I was so glad that the security associate reached out to Andrea and informed her about the situation. Andrea helped me and Robert from purchasing provided me the tracking information about the package. As a courtesy, Andrea took good care of the shipping but still those employees must learn their lesson. Thank you. Best Regards, MK",6-Jun-17,3
"We chose this hotel because of it's proximity to Union Square and the Bart. We took the Bart from the airport and got off at Powell Station as indicated on their website. Do not exit the Bart at this stop. Go one further to Montgomery Station. The Powell Station stop is full of homeless people, is filthy, and reeks of urine. Montgomery is only three blocks from the hotel and is a much better choice. The hotel was fine, but very expensive. To park a car overnight was $67. You are paying for the location. The beds were comfortable, everything was clean, but there was nothing special about it. If I were to stay in San Fran again, I would choose to stay down at Fisherman's Wharf.",5-Jun-17,3
"The staff were terrible. Room was tiny. They did not clean our room on one day. Never enough towels, coffee, glasses or pillows for 4 adults. Waited over 1 hour each time we called for items. Breakfast is good but $32 per person!!! Elevators are terribly slow! Price for the value is WAY too much. Grand Hyatt definitely let us down. ",4-Jun-17,1
"The Grand Hyatt has been renovated, but the carpeting in the rooms and upholstery are already stained and looking dirty. The rooms have motorized shades and a confusing Lutron programmed lighting switch system, but no money was spent on essentials such as insulation between walls or floors. It is a bad sign when the bathroom amenities include two pairs of 3M earplugs, which we had to use at night, because any sneezing, tv noise, phone calls from adjacent rooms can be heard clearly. Similarly, when anyone adjacent or above or below your room uses the bathroom, the noise from water running or more personal noises can be heard clearly.The decor of the rooms is very modern, but the housekeeping quality is very low. When we tried to put some of our clothes into the credenza, we were greeted by a thick layer of dust on the shelves.Amenities are quite skimpy in the rooms and we had to request shower caps and slippers. There is a very good quality water tap in the ice room on each floor for refilling bottles.",3-Jun-17,3
"Great hotel, extremely helpful staff, the service was impeccable. We had a club room, which included a hot breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon plus the usual continental offerings), a hot appetizer selection in the evening, alcoholic drinks on an honors system.Our room was very clean and up to date, the only thing i would mention is that the shower was rather narrow, it wasn't a big issue for us but might be for tight for some.",3-Jun-17,5
Great location within walking distance of everything. Had Club Access which was nice. Breakfast in the Club was outstanding. Self Parking was not difficult but still expensive which is to be expected. Only disappointing thing was relatively small health club and no pool. Great service and helpful staff.,2-Jun-17,4
"The whole staff at the Hyatt made our stay in San Francisco delightful, thanks to their high degree of professionalism and more than anything for taking care of all our needs and questions with a smile.",2-Jun-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco offers the best in location, service, views and comfort. It's location is ideal for stepping right out into the heart of the city - you're just a few footsteps away from world-class shopping, restaurants, cafes, Union Square and Chinatown. And if you need to work off the exquisite food you'll be enjoying, the Hyatt's Fitness Center has an awesome view of the San Francisco skyline - an unexpected benefit I enjoyed while burning off a few calories! Service is excellent at Hyatt - very personal and attentive. It's on my list of best hotels in San Francisco - I'll be back!",2-Jun-17,5
"The Hyatt was very clean, parking was fairly decent but very expensive. However the lot does have a 35 per day sodvial if you park yourself. It's close and the valet clued us in to the savings. The front desk was pleasant with plenty of staff to help on a holiday weekend. Bar was quiet and great for a couples get away. Wait staff attentive ",1-Jun-17,4
"I stayed at this hotel for New Year's and had a blast. This hotel is in a great location and has wonderful rooms. If you want to be central to the financial district and stones throw from several other touristy parts of San Francisco, this hotel is the best. Rooms are clean, spacious and the front desk staff are very pleasant. The only downside are that prices for rooms, food, parking, etc, are quite high.",31-May-17,4
"We stayed one night over Memorial Weekend to visit family. The hotel is in a great location as we rode in on our motorcycle and parked at the garage across the street. Very safe and secure place to leave the bike in the garage. The staff is wonderful and very accommodating. We stayed in Room 1408, which has a nice view, was extremely clean and had a nice feel to it. However, the room makes very odd creaking noises especially when guests in adjacent rooms are walking around. It was extremely annoying when it started around 7 a.m. and kept going for a good hour. It was very hard to try and ignore and get back to sleep. Note to self: no to Room 1408. Even though the room had an issue, this won't stop us from staying here again as we have always enjoyed staying at this hotel.",31-May-17,5
"Excellant location of the property, right at the steps of union square. Restaraunts, cafes, shopping all in a 5-10 min walking distance. Room sizes are small compared to most prime properties located in metro cities globally. ",30-May-17,4
We were treated like royalty and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room was immaculate and the views were amazing. The free breakfast was very good. Hot and a good variety to please any palet.,30-May-17,5
"Excellent location, superb staff and overall a very comfortable hotel for both business and personal travel. I have organized over a dozen programs at this property our recent years and have always had a positive experience.",30-May-17,5
"If you want to be part of the action in SF This is the spot for you! Modern, unfussy and meticulous ! The staff was fabulous, roomy 2full size bed room with a view on club floor was fabulous ! We interacted with so many staff members, from the bellman to the concierge, all were courteous and helpful. Great bar and restaurant, even comfortable lobby space to people watch. ",29-May-17,5
Thanks Grand Hyatt for making our anniversary a fun memorable one. Loved our room and off course the view had to seal the deal! We also got complimentary wine and chocolates with strawberry. Which was amazing!! The guest service given by the staff here was outstanding and we'll definitely be staying here again for future celebrations. ,27-May-17,5
The worst staff attitude in the whole Hyatt hotels that I ever stayed. Front door staffs aren't helpful even they see you carrying luggages. Check-in staffs are cold and always try to ask you to pay more to upgrade to a better room. ,26-May-17,1
"I stayed while on a recent business trip and was very pleased with my stay. I was lucky to be a mobile key beta tester, which worked out perfectly and allowed me to bypass the check-in process (and also not worry about whether my phone and my key ever touched). The room itself was more than adequate...yes, the carpet and the furniture felt and looked a little tired, but the room and the bathroom were more than adequate. And while the bar was a nice ""end of day"" sanctuary with a nice assortment of local wines (and bonus snack of cheese popcorn), the hotel's location made it easy to explore. There's a Starbucks directly across the street, where folks don't judge if you stop in in your pajamas. And just in case, there's also a CVS across the street. Plus, there's a couple suitable restaurants within a quick walk, and it's just a 20 min walk to the Ferry Building.I also used the gym, which totally met my needs and expectations and wasn't too crowded during the early morning hours. One additional thing that I always enjoy is that there was a water dispenser in the ice area on my floor. I really appreciate that extra kind of touch.",24-May-17,5
"San Francisco, it's one of my preferred cities in America, you never get to know if you're in USA, due to the lot of people from different Asian countries such as Japan, China, South Korea, Vietnam,Malaysia and of course Thailand I can't complain about this beautiful city, when you cross the Golden Gate Bridge, to se the Muir Woods Park, while in the city to make an stop on once the best China Town in America, their Restaurants superb on different Asian dishes displays and flavors, for me quite a very interesting bet for a real loving vacation, for this and more....I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO, excuse me I almost forget..the famous Fisherman's Wharf place for good food also, specially for Crabs, Salmon, Tuna fish and big shrimps dishes. Now to finish this fascinating explanation on my beloved City of San Francisco(SFO). Many years ago on my honeymoon journey with Pan Am, we visited the Castiglione Restaurant at Fisherman's Wharf, my suprise was to see personally and greet him, the owner of the place New York Yankees Baseball's player...JOE DIMAGGIO, who was born in California in a little town near San Francisco, called Martinez, unforgettable remembrance for ourself and a big testimony left to our three sons and five grandchildrens in Madison,Wisconsin and Orlando, Fla, oh sorry to tired to tell you these herein lived. Arigato, Touche,Grazie, Merci, Danke, Grazie, Gracias, Obrigado and ..THANK YOU my dear TRIPADVISORS friends for ever and ever.",24-May-17,5
"I enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location is perfect: close to Union Square but with the access in a quieter street. The service was good, also the food at the main restaurant. This is best Dog Friendly Hotel we had ever stayed.",24-May-17,5
"Hmmmh... the room that I stayed in looks modern and nicely remodeled. I have a nice view looking to the city line. Great location if you are here to shop or for business meetings. Within walking distance to big shopping centres and CBD. But the room layout is a bit wierd. The entance door is next to my bed so when the door is open people from the outside can see you straight away. Because the door is positioned this way, I can hear lots of noises from the isle and people slaming doors which is not helping when you're having a jetlag! Also they didn't provide vanity kit like tooth brush, shower cap! Amenities are quite standard consider the price I pay. Which I find really odd. I would've given a 4-5 stars otherwise.",24-May-17,3
"This was our first time at the Grand Hyatt. We stayed on the 32nd floor with a city view, I had requested a Bay view but when you have access to the Grand Lounge it makes the city view OK. Grand Lounge was excellent, convenient and the food and drinks were great.",24-May-17,5
"It had been 10years since we visited San Francisco. This time we were traveling with our teenage daughters. I remember that the last place we stayed the bathroom was so tiny. This time I was determined to at least have a decent sized bathroom. It was a pleasant surprise. Our room had a view of Union Square - which was an extra cost. However, it was nice to be able to wake up to the view of the Bay!! The Grand Hyatt is conveniently located to The Cheesecake Factory - one block away - a place we ate frequently!! There was also a convenient corner store which we found on our last day. This double story convenience store had an extensive pharmacy upstairs and grocery items were on the street level section. Thank you San Francisco- we will be back. Ensure you take advantage of Uber - it's a great service and we used it constantly during our stay!!",23-May-17,4
"We loved our experience at the Grand Hyatt, and would definitely recommend and return. Staff was friendly and accommodating! Shout out to Michaela! Location is perfect, easy to access all of San Francisco.",23-May-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt was the first hotel my wife and I stayed at during our 7 day California vacation, and it was a perfect choice!We were welcomed by Luigi at the Reception desk and were quickly (which was nice after a delayed flight from Boston) provided details on our room, where the amenities were located, and to top it off a nice gift. The next day we experienced great views from our room on the 22nd floor, the floor to ceiling windows were perfect for pictures. There was also a button bedside to adjust the automatic curtains up and down, since this was an East facing room. Overall we had a very good experience, my only complaint is that the water pressure in the shower could have been better.",22-May-17,4
"Great location in San Francisco - easy walking distance to Union Square as well as Chinatown and lots of bars and restaurants and shopping.3 stars as value for money is not really there - I was left unimpressed by the decor, the service and the quality of the rooms (sheets, towels, etc...). From a Hyatt brand, I was expecting more, especially considering the $200+ room rate before taxes...",22-May-17,3
"If you are planning on staying in Union Square, I highly recommend this hotel. We stayed at another chain just down the street and the rooms were tiny and dated. For a lower cost, the Hyatt was phenomenal.",22-May-17,4
"Location is top notch, good price and best service ever especially valet attendant, they're super friendly. The reason why i don't give 5 stars because of no swimming pool and the furniture was a bit outdated. ",21-May-17,4
"We stayed in room 1001, which had constant elevator noises (humming and whirring), during our 2 night stay. The toilet flushed like an airplane toilet. The concierge ""service"" was marginal at best. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.",21-May-17,2
"Booked a suite since we would be sharing space for six days and was pleasantly surprised to find two full bathrooms. Really saved on time an frustration, very comfortable suite!Property in a good location too. ",21-May-17,4
"Overall the room, location and staff were great. It's just that they have the connecting room in almost every room, and we could hear clearly what next door were saying. Our next door were a family of four I guess, very noisy. Otherwise it would have been a 100% stay! ",21-May-17,5
"Myself and my husband stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. The hotel is situated well at Union Square, close to shopping area (Macy's, big brands, ext), car rentals and banks but quit a distance from the Pier.",21-May-17,3
"We had booked 3 nights at the club floor and was trying to get suite rooms upon checked in .Was told that suite room was all sold as they are running full but ask me to try again everyday at the front desk.Realized some bites on the 2nd day during my shower as it was itchy and heated on my feet.It's kind of rashes and in patches.Took pictures and called the duty manager who sent the housekeeping manager, Sidney to check on me.I told Sidney I had some bites and asked if they were the bites of the bed bugs or other bugs in the room . She was so firmed to say that those are definitely not bed bugs bites as she has seen lots of them.I told them I had the similar ones while I was in India and was told by the local doctor that it was bed bugs bites.I then told her that I can't confine the bites on me now as I am not a certified doctor or medical staff.She then relented and mentioned that she too was not certified to determine the bites and will call in the specialist group to check on the room.Hours later, I received a call from her that the team has done a check and they certified that the room is free from bed bugs.Great to know , but how about other bugs like dust mites or etc ?I was questioned if I had spent my time outside to incur the bites ! The bites were fresh red when I woke up in the morning ! Why not question which bugs had invaded Grand Hyatt over the night and intruded to our room.Nevertheless, I had asked them to clean up the room and make sure it's clean and not infested as we changed our room next door. The room we used previously was given to our family who checked in that day .PS : picture below may be obscene to some.",20-May-17,1
Had a great experience staying at the Grand Hyatt. Highly recommend this to any one (even families). It's not far from much around the city! Definitely a must stay. Favorite thing about the hotel was the proximity to everything as well as the sleeping conditions for the room.,19-May-17,5
The Grand Hyatt felt like one of the attractions among all the actual tourist stops we made during our visit. My wife and I had two days of fun followed by two days of business (for me) and the location of the hotel made everything very accessible. Great staff and concierge; everyone was so professional and courteous. The catered food/drink during my conference was excellent. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.,18-May-17,5
"Everything about this hotel exceeds expectations. The location is perfect, service excellent, and the One Up Bar is a great late night scene! Loved it! The food in the restaurant is delicious and overall the hotel is clean and well kept ",17-May-17,5
"We visited SF with our toddler and picked the Hyatt due to its proximity to everything downtown. What I appreciated the most about our visit were the following:-We asked for a quiet room for our daughter to be able to sleep soundly. They delivered with a high, corner room-We needed a crib for her to sleep in. They gave us the crib (pack and play) PLUS baby toiletries and a blanket. What a nice and thoughtful touch.-We wanted to check in early because our flight got in early, and they couldn't accommodate that, however offered to call or text immediately once a room was available. We were able to check in just about an hour after we arrived.The room we got was clean, and modern. It really made our weekend away special.Every employee we encountered there was friendly, and helpful. There appeared to be employees just looking for people who needed help, and asking if they need help. It's this kind of service that will keep me coming back to Hyatt for personal, and work travel. We can't wait to come back.",17-May-17,5
"The hotel was very clean and the staff were all helpful and professional. we were on the 17th level, still some street noise for the light sleepers, but not much. I ate many meals in the OneUp restaurant in the hotel and the food quality and value were both great. Location was very central and walkable, I will absolutely come back next visit to SFO.",17-May-17,5
"comfortable bed, convenient Union Square location, great value. Extremely solicitous staff. International hotel guests, vibrant lobby. Extremely comfortable and relaxing. A real treat to stay here. Loved the breakfast omelet in restaurant and Starbucks coffee bar in lobby.",17-May-17,5
"I stayed here for 8 nights during a business trip and overall was happy with my stay, good location near some great shopping, spacious room (upgraded room not a standard) and standard amenities for the level hotel.The service was also very good from all interactions I had, particularly front desk staff. Room service standard was good too.The downsides were that the bar lacked any atmosphere. Only played sport on the big TV's with no music. Restaurant was not appealing at all, the little coffee take away place tucked at back corner in foyer is not well advertised at all, wish I'd known it was there 6 days earlier! Room service were just ok, pillows were bad, and the sink in the bathroom is a terrible design, water leaks and it smells. Small things but when you stay for 8 nights it gets annoying.In summary, great for a 4 night stay, maybe not as long as 8 though. ",17-May-17,3
"Everything about this property is 5 stars. Very modern rooms and everything worked well. Bathrooms are really large and finally a hotel shower where the water actually goes down the drain and stays in the shower. I appreciated the light up make up mirror in the bathroom. The sink is a modern basin that is elevated and since I am only 5'1"" I actually had to stand on my toes so that I can wash my face without the water spraying on me. Bed is very comfy as well as the pillows Concierge David Perea was extremely helpful and even gave us his card to help us get in a booked restuarant (it worked)! Hotel is in the heart of Union Square - all of the high end shopping is within walking distance and well as some restaurants. If traveling again to San Fran I would definitely stay here.",16-May-17,5
"For such a large hotel and major hotel chain, this property is HIGHLY recommended. Staff, from Registration desk to housekeeping, seemed genuinely interested in making us feel comfortable and welcome. The service and quality matched even the finer ""boutique"" hotels.",16-May-17,5
We were in San Francisco to go to the Giants game and had the opportunity to stay at the Grand Hyatt - my favorite hotel in the city! The staff bends over backward to help with any need you may have...the rooms are always perfectly appointed and incredibly comfortable.,16-May-17,5
We stayed for one night on a layover from JFK down to SYD. We booked a nicer room but could not take advantage of early check in since the room was not ready until 4PM. We didnt take advantage of the lounge since by the time we checked in we had been out in the city for the day and used the early evening to freshen up a bit. Check-in was smooth and we stored our bags which was easy also. Breakfast was good. Eggs ordered from the chef and a few items at the buffet to compliment the order. We were up early and one of the first guests to arrive and service was quick and attentive. We received a late check out as part of our globalist status which was great since we were not leaving SFO until 11:30 at night.,15-May-17,3
"After a ton of research on where to stay for our San Francisco vacation, my husband and I settled on the Grand Hyatt in Union Square and our expectations were exceeded. The location was great - in the heart of union square and not far from Fisherman's Wharf (took cable car) and Golden Gate Bridge (took uber). The hotel was very nice in and outside of our room and the staff was pleasant and helpful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel for couples and families alike! If you are able to take advantage of the breakfast provided, it is worth the money or Hyatt points!",15-May-17,5
"The San Diego Grand Hyatt is Grand!!! San Francisco, doesn't even come near to the same caliber. No swimming pool, ran down decor, including bearings on the floor when we entered, and a hand towel looking previously used. As our stay continued did we then realize they were bearings after a night out and we put our feet up to relax, and kerplop, kerplop. I wasn't about to call for someone at 10 when we were exhausted. Also the booking woman had said she would have wine up in our room upon arrival for my husband's birthday. Nope, at check in another lady asked if we wanted something and they would bring it up- Not quite the surprise I was hoping for. No bathroom fan. The heater was crazy.",15-May-17,2
"Super close to union square and the shopping district! Staying on the 19th floor, the room was quiet and spacious. Plenty of storage and desk space for all my shopping bags! Housekeeping were exceptional at cleaning up super fast! Just ran across the street to Starbucks one morning and returned 10 minutes later and the room was spotless! Concierge very helpful and check in was a breeze. Doorman always ready to open the door for you or call a cab. Recommend to anyone wanting to stay in union square!",14-May-17,5
I have been coming to this property for over 40 years. I have seen numerous iterations of design. Every one met the expections of the time. The current design is modern but with a classic feel. I've also seen managers come and go. The current team is exceptional. Mr DeVitt has carried on a great and long standing tradition. I'm sure his replacement will carry on the great tradition. The property is perfectly located. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in SF. ,13-May-17,5
"It rains a lot and super windy this Feb in San Fran, the architecture itself it too old to go though bad weather...whole nights I've been suffered from the noises cause by the wind. It's so terrible even with ear plug...The staffs are really nice, breakfast was great, hope next time when I visit the weather is better...",13-May-17,3
exceptional location close to shopping; remembered me from previous visits; early check in was appreciated after long flight; staff very accomodating re information on how to get to two different locations,12-May-17,5
"This is my second time staying at the Grand Hyatt for business. Great location, friendly staff, clean rooms. Very nice gym and great views from the top floor. Highly recommend if you're looking for a decent hotel and a nice area. ",12-May-17,4
We stayed here before but this time they out did their self. Nice remodel! The only thing I have to say that wasn't what I thought is online I had upgraded my room and did not get it. I requested 3 special things and did not get them. I did these things online before my arrival. I can say we ate a light dinner one night and had Jay as our server. He was wonderful! In the bar we had Sue.....again she was wonderful. We went back out third night to see her but she was off. She would tell us to come back and see her. Wonderful hotel and we love the location.,12-May-17,5
"We stayed here only for 1 night in January. In terms of location in San Francisco you can't beat it, you have everything on your doorstep. The Breakfast the next morning was amazing, delicious and fresh. Really enjoyed it. On the day that we left I got to the airport and remembered I left a envelope full of Foreign Exchange and cash in the safe. I was too late to go back and called the Hotel once I got to Los Angeles. They told me to call back the next day as the room was not cleaned yet. I called back and they found the money. I was flying back to Australia the next day. Between the Hotel security and the Manager they organised for the cash to be converted into a bank cheque because they couldn't post so much cash overseas. They didn't charge me a cent for the bank cheque or the postage. I had all my money back within 2 weeks. I never got to thank them but that was truly top class service my a Hotel. I will most definitely stay there again next time. ",12-May-17,5
"Perfect location for a break in the city, rooms were spotless, beds comfy and loved the coffee machine in the room . Had snacks and cocktails in the bar both were good. All the staff very friendly and helpful especially the concierge nothing is too much trouble for them helped us every day with our planned itinerary. The Bart train from the airport stops within walking distance of the hotel.",11-May-17,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt just off Union Square as part of a conference. Excellent service all around both in the guest room and as part of the conference. We were on the 36th floor for meetings, what a view! ",9-May-17,5
"very expensive rates USD 339 before taxes for a standard room, no breakfast included !!! very noisy doors that keep people awake as soon as one closes their room doors TV channels are 99% US channels, lacking international TV channels",9-May-17,1
Spent 4 nights here...floor 7 corner room--huge and very comfortable. Slept really well on good mattress with great pillows. Coffee maker used every morning..lovely lying in bed with coffee looking over Union Square. Nice breakfast-just once as a treat. Bar area comfy. BUT 1 thing I didn't get was why the top floor 36 wasn't used as a bar as the views are wonderful from there. In all a great stay.with good staff.,9-May-17,5
A good hotel in a great location close to Union Square. Large rooms with great staff. They are happy to provide those items you forget. Has a bar which serves meals as well as a restaurant. Concierge was very helpful. ,7-May-17,4
"Stayed 3 nights for a conference at the hotel. Very friendly service throughout the hotel. Room was well-appointed and immaculate. Housekeeping was very prompt and did an excellent job. Plenty of pillows, which was really nice. The bed wasn't the best I've slept on, but was still good. Conference facilities are nice. Good WiFi on my devices. Convenient location. ",7-May-17,5
"We stopped here for a one week vacation. We took a suite on the 7th and it had super views of Union Square! Opposite Macy's and not too far from Fisherman's Wharf! Clean, modern, recently renovated, great staff - great hotel.",6-May-17,5
"Loved the location, perfect place for families wanting to shop and be in th middle of action.... hop on hop off bus stop 50 steps away. Only negative was not so friendly staff at door with no greetings each time you walk in and out of hotel ",6-May-17,4
"Attending convention at hotel so stayed for convenience. Had lower floor room with view of Union Square; view was marvelous but noise was a concern (it IS a big city, after all). Room was spacious with appropriate amenities; staff was unfailing polite, courteous, professional and helpful - every recommendation about food or attractions was spot on. Tough to beat location too",6-May-17,5
"Terrific hotel in the heart of San Francisco. I have stayed at more than twenty hotels in San Francisco, but always come back to the Grand Hyatt for value, convenience and comfort. The One Up Restaurant has a fantastic Cioppino that has the right touch of ingredients. The staff is friendly and always accommodates the guest. I work a lot of hours, so when I need to go to San Francisco, it is usually on a red eye so that I can spend the entire next day in the city. I usually land around 4 a.m. at SFO and the Grand Hyatt always lets me check-in early so I can catch a couple of hours of sleep before enjoying the city.",5-May-17,5
"Very nice hotel and great location. Staff was especially attentive to me-- thank you Ira who helped me on the phone before I arrived. Rooms are clean and modern, and hotel is very well located. Overall was just a very easy experience. Thank you ",5-May-17,5
"We did an overnight stay at the Grand Hyatt after meeting friends for dinner and not wanting to make the two hour drive back home late at night. This was our second stay here and we utilized the Grand Club perk and we are so pleased we did. The complimentary appetizers served during happy hour were plentiful and they had an honor bar where you could create your own beverage. Where else in this city can you get a cosmopolitan for $4?? The breakfast served in the Club was so great, large variety of food options and the attendants were so kind. You can't beat the centralized location, will look forward to our next stay.",3-May-17,5
Recently took my wife on an overnight weekend to the city. Had a wonderful experience from checkin to checkout. Staff was attentive to every need and extremely helpful with directions. Wonderful Hyatt club view overlooking the bay. Hotel is conveniently located with wonderful restaurants within walking distance or a short taxi ride. ,3-May-17,5
Too much elevator noise and inattentive staff to a special problemâ€_staff was rude instead of trying to solve a problem. Staff was aware of problem at check in and refused to take care of a long time customer.,2-May-17,1
"This is our 2nd time in SFO for a weekend get away and stay at the Grand Hyatt. We love how close it is to Union Square. Though it was with some difficulty and work I was able to determine that the Deluxe Suite on the 33rd floor has the best view in the hotel! Floor to ceiling windows and a large entertaining area were there's a lot of counter space for food and drinks. Felt like we didn't use the rooms full potential. We highly recommend the Grand Club Room on the 32nd floor for breakfast and cocktails. Another place with floor to ceiling windows and amazing views! We used the car service for pick up at the Airport, Grand Limousine, but I wouldn't use them again. The car was very old and worn. This is the only company the hotel has a contract with which means they will bill you on your hotel charges.",2-May-17,4
A good property but somehow too expensive given the property.. good location in the heart of Union square .. a definite choice for shoppers... lot of good eating places around and very close to the fisherman's wharf too...,1-May-17,5
"First of all, the receptionist area is very cool + high tech so we don't need to wait for so long. Furthermore, the bedroom is quite spacious, while the meeting room has great views to the city and bay area. Finally, the location is very centered in Union Square San Fransisco. I enjoy my stay there.",30-Apr-17,5
"My husband stays here regularly for business and when I come out to San Francisco myself I will often stay there for work with him as well. The rooms are serviceable- it isn't hip or chicly appointed-but the mattresses are comfortable, the showers have good water pressure and they think through basics like plenty of places to plug in. It is a great choice for a business traveler. The real treat of the property is the club. It has gorgeous view of the San Francisco skyline and the bay. Plus they do a great job with breakfast and snacks (you could make a whole dinner of it). Make sure you have access! You won't regret it if only for the pictures.",30-Apr-17,4
"I'm a big fan of Hyatt hotels, love their style and you know what you're getting every time. We stayed in the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for 4 nights, one of which was our wedding night. On arrival we were upgraded to an exec room, which was a lovely way to start our stay. The room had the typical Hyatt style and with an amazing view of Union Square. As part of the upgrade we were entitled to use the exec lounge which included a beautiful breakfast each morning. The hotel team were always friendly and helped whenever we had a query. We couldn't have asked for a better stay! ",30-Apr-17,5
"Stayed at the Hyatt on our wedding week. The hotel kindly decided to upgrade us to a bigger room at a higher floor with breakfast and lounge access included. They were very attentive to our needs.The room was nice and modern and very clean! Also, one of the best mattresses I have ever slept in. Great stay! ",30-Apr-17,5
"I arrived during a power failure in the city, but a large amount of the staff was in the lobby greeting guests, passing champagne, being generally accommodating and jovial. I was lucky the key system started to work just as I arrived and I was given a key. I rode up the service elevator with an amazing property engineer who was fantastically friendly and apologetic about the problems. All in all, I was no worse for the wear, despite the terrible potential, potential that might have materialized in a hotel inept at handling difficult situations. I'm sorry I can't rate this hotel 5 stars, but the front door staff was generally disappointing. In fact, on the day of my departure, they stood around without offering to help with luggage. As I waited for an ride share service, a taxi drove pulled up and started berating us for taking Uber rather than a cab, but the staff just laughed and let the driver yell at us. I would have expected them to step up, obtain the driver's information, and ensure their guests were not verbally mauled by someone in their front drive---no such luck. They seemed to find it comical. Since I walked my dog daily, I noticed the difference between the Hyatt's door staff and the other hotels. At each hotel (except the Hyatt), the staff was friendly and generally chatted with me, often coming to greet the dog. At my own hotel, however, I got none of that treatment and, many times, was left to open the door by myself with a dog leash in one hand and packages or coffee in the other. Truly the door staff was noticeably worse than the other hotels in the area. Housekeeping was good and accommodating to my pet in the room, but not always responsive when one called. Room service food was mediocre, and service staff at the 'coffee cart' seemed a bit lost. Concierge was excellent, as was the gentleman who checked us out. The hotel has an amazing location, probably it's strongest asset. Sadly, if the atmosphere I experienced during the power failure had been consistent throughout the stay, this hotel would have been a home run. Once 'back to normal', the Grand Hyatt was disappointing. There are nicer hotels with much better service in the city. One final note: the friendliest staff I met in the hotel in my 5 day stay was the engineering staff. They greeted me each time they saw me, chatted in the elevator, and took a genuine interest in my stay. I wish I could remember the name of the engineer working the elevator on the first day--he was fantastic as well.",28-Apr-17,2
Downhill recently - Okay for biz. Old GP Program would make this hotel wonderful. However lounge is packed and kids are everywhere. WoH means upgrades are few and far between. Room smelt off and couldn't move rooms even being top level WoH Member.,28-Apr-17,3
"The hotel is in a great location in Union Square. Starbucks is across the street. Shopping all around. Chinatown just a few minutes away. Traffic is crazy. We got around on foot, the Big Bus Tour and Uber. Much better than paying for valet.",28-Apr-17,5
"Great location off Union Square, great access to Market and Mission Streets and China town. Use Muni or Uber for a trip to Golden Gate park. It IS expensive: if you're going to do it, upgrade to the highest floors where you get free food at the Grand Hyatt Lounge and free Wifi. Also, plan to spend about $30/day for parking, or arrive by Uber.",28-Apr-17,5
Great club experience great view of bay and city .service was like a great restaraunt. David was the best host I have ever had in a club of this kind the drinks are only 3 dollars and 4 for mixed which you mix on your own and only the best brands. Great champagne. Great location by union square. Rooms are remodeled on the floor were we stayed 33. Club is on 32,26-Apr-17,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for four days, two adults and one child.The hotel's location cannot be stressed enough - it is within walking distance of the main sites and the starting point for almost any tour of the city.The rooms are clean and well kept. The windows have an electric shade and have a TV, coffee kit and a closet. The bathroom is basic but maybe a little too small for its fixtures - the toilet was located in a weird position, very close to the bathtub/shower.The shower had a consistent water pressure which was not very powerful but sufficient.The staff were friendly and went out of their way to assist us with any request. Our initial choice of a twin double bed room did not work out. The view of union square was breath taking (even on 'just' the 8th floor) but construction work meant that the noise started early in the morning. We switched to a single king-size which faced due north, away from the square and on the 16th floor. View was less inspiring but much quieter.On our last day, the electricity for the entire area blacked out. The hotel services were completely disabled. The hotel staff took this in stride and took steps to assist the guests. The stairs were lined with smiling staff, thanking everybody for their patience and understanding and assisting guests. A small snacks buffet was set up and soon after one of the elevators was brought online. Cleaning service continued regardless. Well done on that.",26-Apr-17,5
"Our trip was amazing from the time we step out of our car, until we had to check out. It is nicely placed in the city and has a lot to offer right around the corner. Also note parking was easy and not too expensive. We would come back anytime!",26-Apr-17,5
"A King room was booked in advance and paid for but unavailable at check-in. Obviously this hotel practices overbooking and made a decision to give our room to another guest. So, you needed this post to be at least two hundred characters, ok. Hopefully this extra verbage will make you happy.",26-Apr-17,3
"Great hotel. They did an excellent job with the power out for seven hours. I was impressed. They were using a command station to hand check people in, giving away bottles of water and gatoraid. Our room was well cleaned. We loved the location. ",26-Apr-17,5
"This Hyatt is located in the center of life in San Francisco! exit the hotel and there is a Starbucks right across the street. Walk a few more steps and you are surrounded by shops like Lululemon, Macy's, Nike, North Face and everything else you can think of! 2 blocks away from China Town and not far of a walk from the Warf. we stayed for 2 days and parked our car in hotel parking and didn't see it again until we left because we were able to walk and not worry about driving in the traffic. amazing view from the top floor of the Hotel where you can see the bay. ",25-Apr-17,5
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt, nothing was to much trouble,room was excellent, customer service was excellent and the location was brilliant. Easy to get to and the car parking was great. Thank You.",25-Apr-17,5
"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt and were constantly surprised by their guest service standards. From the 'keep/borrow/buy' items to the super helpful concierge who very quickly organised a hire car for us, to the front desk staff who hooked us up with a town car to get to the airport - could not fault them! Great location and great bar for that all important nightcap - highly recommended.",24-Apr-17,5
"A weekend trip to the city. Great location, friendly staff and clean hotel. There was a power outage the day we arrived but the staff handled the crisis really well. I appreciate that but the downfall it took a while to get check-in. ",24-Apr-17,4
"This hotel is close to everything - BART, the cable cars, 2 starbucks on opposite corners, McDs, a cute diner, nice restaurants like Morton's, and shopping at Union Square. It's an okay Hyatt. Not sure why it's considered a ""Grand Hyatt"" though - I've stayed at several ""Grands"" and they all are much nicer and special. This one is 'just a regular' Hyatt. But, you know what you are getting, and again, the location is perfect. The rooms did seem a bit tiny though - not a lot of walking around space in them. If you're a gym rat, the gym is nice.",24-Apr-17,4
"We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt. It is in a perfect location in the bustling financial district near shopping, restaurants, trollies, and Chinatown. The staff was excellent and the concierge and room service helpful and kind. We did not feel we were just ""numbers"" amongst the many tourists that surely stay here. They all treated us very personally. The room was very clean, well-appointed and quiet. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel restaurant was also great, including our server ""Van"" who was an impeccable waiter. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in San Fran!!",24-Apr-17,5
Great location. Rooms are small. Common areas are a bit old. Bathrooms lack comfort for the price. Expensive for the quality. I have stayed in other hyatts which are not even grand hyatt with much better room and bathroom quality for less. ,23-Apr-17,3
"From check in/out to the concierge, the staff here were amazing. We requested a bay view room and were on the 24th floor. Great views, nice room. Typical hotel pillows and not enough of them. My main issue, which I did read in other reviews, is the water pressure. It's non existent. We were here as a family vacation, so getting 2 girls with long hair out of the shower was impossible. It took forever! Also, we have a boy and a girl so the pocket door was a swing and a miss. It didn't line up properly, leaving a gap into the bathroom. The other members of the family all had to stay on one side of the room while the bathroom was in use. Great for a few days in the city as it's centrally located and right on Union Square. Everything is clean and updated.",23-Apr-17,4
New management at this hotel is banking on their location and the quick turnaround of guests. If you expect your Hyatt loyalty to be recognized walk over to the Hyatt at fishermans wharf where they will recognize your status. The Grand Hyatt is by far the worst service I have ever received in the system. ,23-Apr-17,1
"This is a world-class hotel, centrally located near Union Square, with a staff that goes the extra mile. The hotel's design is phenomenal - from the lobby to the guest rooms. I've stayed at many hotels in San Francisco and the Grand Hyatt tops them all.",23-Apr-17,5
"I'd pick this hotel over Marriott or Hilton for its location if I'd like to do some shoppings after work. It's right at Union Square and the shops and restaurants there close late, comparing to the ones at Moscone Center or Embarcadero. The hotel is chic comparing to its neighbor, Westin. I like the apartment feel of the floor layout which has about 10 rooms per floor . It is a lot quieter than other big hotels. The rooms were renovated a few years back with modern decor and some bells and whistles like automatic blind, which is convenient. I like the walk in shower. Room is a bit small comparing to Hyatt Regency. The Club continuous to be small even after renovation and added some extra space. Getting a seat during breakfast time is a challenge. View is mostly city buildings with a peak of Alcatraz at a distance. I'd pick Regency for the view.Service, I don't use service but staff are generally helpful.",23-Apr-17,4
"I booked two rooms, a king executive suite and a regular king room at this hotel. When we checked in and went to our rooms, one of the rooms was a double room rather than a king room. Instead of correcting the room situation, the hotel comped us breakfast for two. This is ok, however, I don't understand why we didn't get the room we booked in the first place? Eating breakfast at the hotel really wasn't in our plan since we had an early flight. Getting a good night sleep in the king bed we booked in the first place would have been the ideal situation. An additional negative is the coffee maker in the room did not work.",23-Apr-17,2
"Located right in the middle of the happening areas of SFO, Grand Hyatt lures you with a superb location, nice breakfast spread, warm service & wonderful views from the higher floors! Enjoyed my stay here, and look forward to an encore!!",22-Apr-17,5
Hotel clean.. bed very comfortable.. staff friendly and helpful ... bay view room nice .. super sized sink gave little counter space in bathroom .... restaurant upstairs somewhat over priced ... best go out to eat ... fun experience too ,21-Apr-17,5
"I have stayed in many Hyatt hotels, from the boutique Andaz to the hi-end Park Hyatt, down the line like Hyatt Regency, Hyatt Centric. This Grand Hyatt does not really have what I expected from a Grand Hyatt.The price sure looks like it is from Grand Hyatt . Having said that, the location is really great, only half a block from Union Square, but there are so many hotels around this area, I am pretty sure for the money I am paying, I can find better deals if I do more research.",20-Apr-17,3
"We stayed in a Deluxe Room and the room was a good size and had all the amenities, except of course a kettle! There was a coffee machine however. As this is an issue in most US hotels, whenever we travel to the US we carry our travel kettle with us! On check in we upgraded to the Grand Club, situated on the 32nd floor, for USD 50 per day which included daily breakfast, all day refreshments (juices, coffee/tea and biscuits etc) and horsdevers, which we thought was good value.The location of Grand Hyatt was great for our main interest was to sightsee a bit and do a lot of shopping! It was close to Union Square shopping and most cable cars/trolley stops were close by. As we were on the 3rd floor (the hotel being fully booked due to Spring break), on the weekend the street noise (including sirens from police/paramedics) interrupted our sleep. Service including housekeeping was great. Not negative comments except maybe if the room had a kettle I would have rated it 5 stars!",20-Apr-17,5
"I booked a Bay View room at the Grand Hyatt that was supposed to be on one of the upper floors of the hotel. Initially, they tried to give me a room on a lower floor that would not have provided much of a view at all. When I questioned the man helping us he informed me that they didn't actually have any Bay View rooms available. When I fussed a little they agreed to compensate us with access to the Grand Club where we could get free breakfast, snacks and drinks (honor bar). The Grand Club was nice and all of the employees I dealt with were exceptional. The room itself was okay. I didn't care for the sliding door on the bathroom which provided only minimal privacy, especially when sharing a room with teenagers. It was clean and had a decent view of Union Square, but I expected more the price.",19-Apr-17,4
"I had only 2 nights, but I thought the room - and especially the bathroom - is quite simple (and somehow dated) for a hotel of Hyatt level. I was expecting more for the room price. The mattress was very comfortable (firm, but not hard), many pillows and the room very quiet, though. The location is also very good, near to shops and to the trolley line. I overall liked, but I was expecting more for what I have paid for.",19-Apr-17,3
"This was my second stay at this property. On my first stay, they lost my booking and had to redirect me to their sister hotel in the financial district, an overall unpleasant experience. This stay was vastly better. All of the staff we encountered were helpful, friendly and attentive. The room was clean, with good views, and well appointed. The hotel is well kept. The location, adjacent to Union Square, is excellent, with lots to do in the area. The trolley and bus stop near by, on the corner of Powell and Sutter streets. Chinatown is about a 10 minute walk (through, or over, the Stockton tunnel) and Fisherman's Wharf is about 30 minutes away by foot (walk along Stockton and then Columbus to avoid the hills). One criticism of the hotel, other than the tricky driving location nestled among one-way streets, is the layout of the lobby. The overly modern registration area, with individual pedestal stations, the odd placement of the concierge desk (located across the floor from the registration desk, hidden behind the central elevator bank), the somewhat odd location of the lounge area which seems squeezed in and doesn't provide a view of the entry, and the congestion caused by the confluence of people using the entrance, elevator bank, and the registration area makes the lobby uninviting and unpleasant to navigate and use.",18-Apr-17,4
"Great modern decor, exellent location in front of Union Square, Market, financial district and Chinatown. wonderful service! Parking too expensive. Use Uber instead of driving. Club level was excellent. Staff very customer service oriented! ",18-Apr-17,5
Great for groups. We rented a room with a suite and a room attached. 3 large bathrooms and a great living room/lounge for us to enjoy each other company. Parking was easy to find and the room service was quick and responsive.,18-Apr-17,4
"I've been to SF four times, but always in a different hotel. This time was for family vacation, so I chose this hotel based primarily on location but found that it is so much more. Every staff member we encountered was absolutely wonderful - always a kind word and politeness. We booked two adjoining rooms and they were both very clean and fantastic. The view of the city was tremendous and the location convenient to everything we wanted to do. The cable car and shopping were a short walk (5 minutes) and the self-park across the street was affordable and convenient. My wife and both teenage sons loved it and it really made our vacation that much more memorable. We're already planning a return visit and will definitely be staying here again!",18-Apr-17,5
"I've stayed at Hyatt in Denver and had a much more pleasant experience. Both Hyatt experiences were for work. When I have my choice, I choose Marriott. Hyatt just hasn't been as good. They are into appearing as they are Glam, but really I feel they are overpriced for the what they offer.",17-Apr-17,3
"I prefer and frequent Hyatt Hotels for business and casual travel. I brought my daughter to this location for our Spring Break vacation. The hotel is kept very clean however, it is very noisy all hours of the night. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you're looking for a good nights sleep. The next vacation in San Francisco, perhaps I'll try a Hilton. I would also have not brought my 16 year old daughter to this hotel. There's not an onsite store and one choice of restaurant inside the hotel. Just not a good ""family"" oriented hotel for vacationing families. Has more of a ""work or business"" vibe to me.",17-Apr-17,3
"I stayed here primarily because of the location on Union Square, so as to be close to both the Moscone Center and all the shops and restaurants in this area. The Grand Hyatt is a modern-looking hotel and this carries through to the contemporary decor of the rooms. These are a good size, well decorated in soothing tones and with comfortable bedding. My main criticism is of the poor water pressure of the shower head.Despite giving the hotel a five star rating, I decided to ask for a room change on the first night because of noise. This was partly because I hadn't realised that the cleaner had left the balcony window slightly open (I had a late check-in and was too tired to notice until next morning) but also because of building work on the street below. Asking for a room change though was easy enough - I was reassigned efficiently and without fuss. All other interaction with the hotel staff, either at the lobby or the restaurant, was also very efficient and polite. The new room proved to be better, being on a different side of the hotel, slightly larger and also with a better view given the higher floor. (If you specifically want a room with some kind of a view, you will need to go for a higher floor, given that the hotel is loacted in the heart of the Union Square area.)For this stay, my room rate included breakfast. The buffet breakfast at this hotel is one of the best that I have had, in the US at least. The fare on offer is not very extensive, but the ingredients and cooking are of the highest quality - all apart from the coffee, which in contrast is rather bland and tasteless. I did not have any other meals at the hotel, but I am sure they would also be of a good quality.So overall, a very comfortable modern hotel in a good location, with polite staff and a very nice breakfast buffet, and just a few minor minuses (in my case the poor shower pressure and the tasteless coffee).",17-Apr-17,5
"Hotel is well located next to Union Square, China Town making most areas of the city pedestrian friendly. Staff is very professional and accommodating, which is why we prefer to stay at Hyatt branded hotels.",17-Apr-17,5
"I stayed here for three nights while attending a conference in San Francisco. Up front, I need to state that I did not take advantage of most of the hotel's amenities, as I was just there to sleep. I arrived after 1a.m. for check in and I waited a short time at the desk while the staff helped another guest, but when it was my turn they were efficient and gracious. Besides key cards, the staffer offered me bottled water to take upstairs. My room was on the 23rd floor, and the view was not very remarkable to the east. I never figured out how to open the shades and had to wiggle under/behind them in order to look out, which I only did about twice. The bed was very comfortable and had about six pillows of different firmnesses. There were little reading lamps on goosenecks at each side of the bed. A tiny refrigerator in a cabinet, other appliances similarly hidden. Three random books on a shelf above the desk.The bathroom was clean and bright, but the toilet was too close to the tub, so that I had to climb over it to reach the tub faucet. The shower was one of those wands on a long flexible tube, but I would have preferred a more traditional type. The water control handle was loose the first morning and fell off in my hand on the second day. Luckily I was able to stick it back on without flooding the room. The water was always instantly hot enough. I did not care for the sink basin: a large oblong trough above the surrounding surface. It was like a baby bathtub on a table. The drain plug did not seal and it took up too much space, so my toiletries were always hidden under the edges or shoved into the corners. On the third morning, half of the light bulbs around the mirror went out.The room was very quiet and peaceful. I was across the hall from the ice machine but only heard noise from there once, and no guest traffic from the corridor, elevator lobby, or the neighboring rooms. In fact I never saw another person on the floor.I checked out early on a Tuesday morning, with no difficulty. The staff offered to call me a taxi if I needed it. I was impressed with the front door that was always staffed by a man to open it for guests coming or going. The hotel was next to a big Apple Store across the street from union square, but it felt safe. There was plenty of foot traffic near there, a CVS across from the lobby and restaurants all around. ",16-Apr-17,4
"This was my first time staying at this hotel and the location. While this was a business trip, the location of the hotel is great. There are really nice shops, the second largest Apple Store (next door) that I've seen ever and plenty of places to eat. The entire staff was professional and welcoming. The conference that I attended was so well done that I forgot that I was at a hotel. Nice job! ",16-Apr-17,5
"Loved this place! We came for Thanksgiving last year and had a blast; would definitely splurge for the Union Square view next time for the Christmas Tree lighting ceremony. Our room was not available right away, so they gave us a credit for $50. The other hiccup was that the crib we requested at check-in was not delivered until I called but this I've learned is a common problem with the hotels since no one expects a baby to go to sleep at 7pm... so we always have to call and wait.I loved the decor and comfy bed. View was nice too. Very close to everything, which was very convenient with an infant. Enjoyed their restaurant and bar as well.",14-Apr-17,5
My wife and I stayed here as part of a large group. The check in process was swift and pleasant. Our room was clean and although we didn't pay extra for a higher floor with a view the room did have view of the bay. The meeting space is nice and accommodating. We appreciated the late check out on our last day. Only complaint was with concierge. We asked her for help finding an inexpensive place for lunch and were open to any suggestions. She was clearly not interested in really helping us and only went through the motions. You expect a concierge to be over helpful and pleasant in a place that charges $300+ a night. Not the case. Still a nice place but can see why this is not top 10 in SF. ,14-Apr-17,4
"My 12 year old son and I stayed in a suite on the 33rd floor for two nights on a trip to celebrate his birthday and see a play. The views of the city are spectacular, and the central downtown location of the hotel is very convenient. The hotel provided a celebratory birthday soft drink and dessert treat for my son, which was really nice. Although we were on a high floor, we could still hear music at night from Union Square and noise from a large construction project in the area during the day. This is normal for a downtown hotel. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms were clean and modern but the furniture in the living room was dated, worn and stained. There were a few minor service issues: when we arrived in the afternoon, there were dirty dishes and garbage outside our room, which were not removed until I mentioned it to front desk staff the next day. I had asked for an early wake up call on the morning of our departure, but woke up early myself and called the hotel operator and asked her to cancel the wake up call after I found out our flight was delayed, as I wanted my son to be able to sleep a bit later. However, she did not cancel the call and he was woken up early by the phone ringing for the automated wake up call.. Overall, the rooms are spacious, and the location is great. If you are not particular about modern furniture or super-attentive service, it is a very good place to stay.",14-Apr-17,4
"We had a 3 day stay in April.Room was a double double bed room with Union Square view. Looks right across from Maceys. Room was a decent size.Beds were comfy. Bathroom was small but ok.Room clean and housekeeping good.Lobby was nice but was filled consistently with conference guests who took up a good deal of the seating and filled the lifts. Front desk staff business polite. Door staff v nice as were porters. $75 to SFO using black SUV outside if booked through hotel. Uber available ($48) but no one accepted our enquiry for an XL so went for $60 in cab. Location great for Union Square. Powell cable car stop 5 mins walk .Every eatery in SF is expensive for what you get, but there are a number within 10 mins walk. (Be prepared to pay more than you expect )Lots of hotels in about 5-10 minute walk of the square at lower cost. We expected a little more for the cost. ",13-Apr-17,4
"If you are visiting San Francisco for a couple of days than this hotel will please. It is very close to the best shopping San Fran can provide and resturants are right there. The price for Autralian visitors is a little exy especially with children. We had a room with 2 double beds on the 31st floor looking over Union square. Nice view of the water and shopping district. However, the glass door allows wind in and howls up the side of the building all night. The blind shifts against the glass, knocking it gently which can keep you up if you are a light sleeper. The wind noise and entering the room is a little much.",13-Apr-17,4
"We had a nice experience staying at the Grand Hyatt during a recent getaway weekend in the city. When I visit a town I look for two things in a hotel: a good location, and a clean, comfortable room. This hotel fit the bill. The central location right off of Union Square is ideal, and makes it easy to get anywhere in town either on foot or on public transit. The rooms look like they were renovated in the last couple of years, and are very nicely appointed. Our room was impeccably clean, which was very much appreciated. In all, it was a very nice stay.",12-Apr-17,5
"Have stayed here the last couple years for a business meeting. Everything is well done. Check-in is easy. Rooms are nice and comfortably sized. Beds are good and rooms are moderately quiet, but could hear folks having a gathering in room next to mine.Meeting rooms are spacious and nice, but in basement so unfortunately lacking any view of daylight. Food service to meetings is great. Buffet service is well done. Bar service is well done, but at big city pricing.",12-Apr-17,5
"Large, central hotel, unfortunately near by building work taking place destructed a little but a great stay. Didn't stop for breakfast as wasn't sure where this was or how it worked. Great room- view brilliant, room service also good! Great location for walking around SF, and for shopping. Friendly. Knowledgeable consierge.",12-Apr-17,4
"Our stay was wonderful. The buffet was amazing every single day. Not only was the buffet good, but so was lunch. It was an amazing stay. The location was awesome. It was near many good restaurants, stores, and near China Town( If you plan to visit it). It was a great stay and the service was outstanding. Next time we go to San Fransisco, I hope we stay at the Grand Hyatt.",11-Apr-17,5
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for four nights. The location is perfect as you can walk to the many San Francisco's fun tourist spots. The fitness room on the 35th floor has a bank of treadmills that overlook downtown to the bay - an awesome view to keep you occupied as you workout. The rooms are quiet and clean. Parking is a challenge ... you can either opt for extremely pricey hotel parking or garage parking across the street at half the price. The only negatives were the room ran hot - even when we turned the air conditioner down - and the bed was uncomforable.,11-Apr-17,4
"We had a wonderful stay with Grand Hyatt in the heart of the city. Special thanks to Arnold Setiadi of the Front Office who went out of his way to accommodate our needs. We booked a club level double room and asked for a quiet room on the highest floor. Unfortunately we were assigned a room facing the busier road (Union Square). I talked to Arnold when we were checked in and he was able to work with his manager to secure a room on the top level facing the bay for us. He even showed us the room before we committed! The room has stunning views of the bay and was very quiet! It is updated and beautiful. The club level is 32 floor and has good views of the bay as well. As other reviewers said, there were plenty of food choices. Overall, we had a wonderful stay. We will definitely come back!",10-Apr-17,5
Stayed here for a conference. The room was very clean with a great City view. The cleaning staff was prompt and did a good job everyday. The hotel also has a restaurant and bar where you can order food and drinks.,10-Apr-17,5
"We paid up for the concierge floor and a view of the bay.....absolutely worth it. They offer a large variety for breakfast.....eggs, bacon, fruits, cereals pastries, bagel with all the fixings. They also have a happy hour with do it yourself cocktails for $3 or $4, fill your glass as full as you wish. And they have a desert bar in the later evening. And our view was spectacular! We found everyone to be friendly and helpful.",10-Apr-17,5
"This was a perfect location for museums, restaurants and shopping The friendly staff made the trip special and remembered us each time we returned from an outing. Highly recommend the Grand Hyatt experience.",10-Apr-17,5
"If you are a Hyatt diamond, this is place to stay in San Fran. Quick Uber to any downtown hot spots and rooms have great views. All staff are nice and helpful, many restaurants and shopping are within walking distance. My fav part is the Grand Club room, which has great hot and cold items for breakfast and offers views of Alcatraz, Coit tower, Sales force tower, etc",9-Apr-17,5
"Amazing bay views from our room. Great that the window opened a few inches for fresh air. Bathroom was spacious and water pressure was excellent. The room interior was slightly dated, however, the lobby is gorgeous and comfortable to relax in. The staff were friendly, helpful and kind. We were made to feel very welcome. ",9-Apr-17,4
"We had a great 3 night stay at the Grand Hyatt. The bed and breakfast package is fabulous for families. The breakfast buffet was amazing and left our boys happy and well fueled for all our San Francisco adventures. It is a bit of a walk from most family activities (which are located down closer to the piers) but our kids loved exploring Chinatown and there were several great restaurants near by. Our 11 year old was impressed with how ""cool"" the hotel decor was! The wait staff at the One Up restaurant were fabulous! So friendly and helpful. All in all a great location for a family to explore San Fran!",8-Apr-17,5
"Not my first stay here, I really like this hotel. It has a great location right by union square, with easy access to most of San Frans top tourist sites. I was here with a conference and the hotel is very easy to work with and the meeting space is very nice. They have meeting/event/general purpose rooms on the top floor that has the most amazing views. The rooms are clean and comfortable. and over all very decent. Pros:amazing locationfriendly staffmodern hotelgood ballroom spacecons:a little noisy and busyWould I stay here again? absolutely. request a higher floor though. This trip they had me pretty low and it was extremely noisy. This isn't my first time here, and I would happily stay here again. I recommend this hotel for work or personal stays.",8-Apr-17,3
"This hotel is amazing!!!! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good hotel in San Francisco. The view is amazing and the location is in union square so their are lots of shopping and restaurants options within walking distance. The hotel restaurant, oneup, is very good and the service is great. The hotel has an amazing view on the top floor and in the gym. There is also a cable car stop near the hotel.",8-Apr-17,5
Great stay would recommend to all rooms great and food guy at checkout was a bit rude everyone else was very kind especially at the restaurant. The views were excellent and if you go to the top floor there is a better view.,8-Apr-17,5
"My family and I stayed here over our spring break trip to San Fransisco. The coffee bar downstairs was a delight, and the concierge was very helpful, as their map was excellent. The hotel is in a great location, and if you have a car, you have in and out privileges in the parking garage. The only negative was that because there were four of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers), it was very difficult to move about the room in the morning as they are small. There is also only one sink. ",8-Apr-17,5
"This is a very good hotel in a very good locationNo real problems that I could identify Bar is convenient Bar food reasonable but priceyLocation is good for SF MOMACan be slightly noisy at nights but this a big busy and rich city so traffic and construction is never ending, it did not keep me awake thoughAll round I'd recommend this hotel ",7-Apr-17,5
We stayed for 6 nights and although the room was comfortable it could of been a little cleaner. The service was average - not what you'd expect for a Grand Hyatt. Found the staff to be pretty inattentive. ,7-Apr-17,3
"Wonderful location, nicely appointed facility with nice views, but very thin walls. Loud conversations and toilets flushing from other rooms were very annoying and not what I expected from a Hotel of this caliber.",5-Apr-17,3
"Our experience in the Grand Club was outstanding. The wine, beer, and cocktails cost less than $5. The staff, Dave, Billy, and Jimmy were outstanding. Thanks guys! The city view was beautiful. The breakfast had hot and cold items. The evening food had both hot and cold items as well.",5-Apr-17,5
"Great location for work and play. All hotel staff i encountered were very helpful. My room was a little loud (outside noise) but expected in a big city. Suggest requesting a higher floor. One night I ordered late room service, they shared it would take about 30 minutes, to my delight it arrived in about 19 minutes!",3-Apr-17,4
"Stayed here on a business trip and didn't eat in, so can only really comment on the facilities - all of which were in new, good condition and well maintained. Overall, the hotel is in good shape and incredibly quiet given how many rooms and guests it has. I particularly liked the full size sliding glass doors that open to the narrow balconies. In a sunny ans warm San Francisco day you can open them up and sit and enjoy your coffee in your room, feeling like you're on top of the world.",2-Apr-17,4
This hotel is in a great location across the street from Union Square and a couple of blocks away from Chinatown. The subway is a few blocks away. The hotel is old but rooms are nice and somewhat noisy. They even provide earplugs in the rooms. I have stayed here 3 times and will stay again since the staff are really nice and try their best to make you feel at home.,2-Apr-17,4
"I really enjoyed staying at the Grand Hyatt. It was an excellent hotel in a great location. Modern decor, good service & very close to Union Square & shops. I don't have anything negative to say, I would recommend staying here.",1-Apr-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful hotel. All of the staff was extremely friendly, providing first-class service. The rooms were very clean and hotel was in a great location, within walking distance to shopping and dining.",31-Mar-17,5
"Excellent stay. Excellent room. Excellent services. Excellent doormen....except the concierge. Booked for an airport van shuttle for $17 with the concierge lady a day prior my 7 am departure shuttle pick up in the hotel. The lady assured me that she will be be the concierge desk by 7 am the next day. I was ready and by the hotel door by 6:50 am. No van shuttle arrived. I have to mention to doorman Michael my displeasure. He called the Van Express company and my surprise, when they said that I wasnt even in the manifest for pick up. Hyatt did not call them. So Michael, requested the next shuttle which is 7:30 am. What a clear mess up. I dont travel with many loop holes and everything should be rigid and on time. If a hotel promises great services, it should be fulfilled. That's why I chose Hyatt but not anymore after this. Marriott and Hilton will do better. The concierge lady offered $60 cash for a cab and some free breakfast coffee and items. I refused. A cab in SF is worth $80 to the airport with all the tipping and tax etc. $60 really? I was already so upset. I still commend Michael for doing a great job for making sure I get to the next shuttle. This is the cheapest way to the airport but it's the cheapest quality shuttle service this Hyatt can offer. Do not take chance with their shuttle service. With the traffic, I was able to arrive 45 mins prior boarding. Such a stressfull departure.",31-Mar-17,3
"Positive: nice view, excellent breakfast, centrally location, friendly staff, big bathroomImprovements: room was not always quite especially the night at arrival when music was played outside across the hotel",31-Mar-17,4
"Excellent service with warmth, and a heavenly suite that I did not want to leave. Location cannot be beat for access to restaurants, fine shopping and access to transportation. Restaurant and room service also excellent.",30-Mar-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is centrally located and overall, a great place to stay. I highly recommend it for its wonderful dining room, well-appointed sleeping rooms and staff members that truly go ""above and beyond"" to exceed customer expectations.",29-Mar-17,4
"Stay at the Hilton. Beds are more comfortable and staff are more accommodating as far as room preference. Requested a room with a view, got a room with a view of a building on only the 4th floor. The Hilton is a little cheaper with better qualities. ",28-Mar-17,1
Easy to check in. The new world of Hyatt is a mess. I lost access to the Grand Club (their lounge) though I've had access in the past and with lesser points ironically. The customer agent recommended I upgrade to a higher package to continue getting access to the club. The lights in the room did not work. The cordless phone did not work.,28-Mar-17,3
"The SF Grand Hyatt looks to have been recently renovated and is well located outside of Union Square in a busy part of town. The rooms are somewhat small and awkward and the finishes, while newer, are clearly retrofitted over an old framework. I think the property does its best to put its best foot forward but these older locations are tough to work around completely.Staff were courteous and pleasant and I'd stay there again for business. I wouldn't bring my family to this property as I don't think its fancy enough and the on site eating/relaxing options are mediocre.",27-Mar-17,3
The Hyatt is very conveniently located but this property is in serious need of an update. The common areas are nice and the rooms are average and a tad worn. The elevators take a lot longer than normal and the restaurant is overpriced but most hotel restaurants are. The gym has incredible views of the city and is pretty decent for a hotel gym. The staff is mostly friendly and helpful. ,27-Mar-17,3
"With excellent customer service, superb facilities and a welcoming, friendly and responsive staff, Grand Hyatt has earned repeat customers. Great food at One Up; spacious, fully-functioning fridge in room, bottled water provided on request. Beds were fresh, really comfy, cleaning staff consistently did an excellent job.",27-Mar-17,5
"We have originally booked Hyatt House Belmont for San Francisco stay but as they didn't provide us with the room we had booked, we decided to move to Grand Hyatt as the lady who dealt our booking confirmed we were going to stay at connecting room. But the rooms weren't connected and the receptionist didn't explain or apologised about it. We were very tired already so stayed but really annoyed as my daughter and her cousin were in the separate room. We were visiting US from Turkey and my sister and nephew were visiting from Japan so staying at two bedroom suite or connecting room means a lot to us. Next day they moved our room to the connecting one but I ended up changing rooms three days in a low. Not happy about that.Aside from that, location is pretty good for shopping, street car, cable car and sightseeing. Also the view from the room and the club lounge was superb. ",26-Mar-17,3
"Stayed in San Fran for 3 nights in February with a friend. Concierge was helpful and friendly offering us suggestions where to get some dinner (arrived in at 7pm). Room was of a decent size with comfortable beds and a decent bathroom. Location to Union Square was fantastic. The price compared to other hotels in the same are was great as well, I'd definitely stay again.",26-Mar-17,5
"I didn't feel welcome at the hotel when arriving there. The room was a bit shabby and the air conditioning loud and noise, I couldn't use it to sleep. The room was totally overprized - May be my expectations were too high for such a property. The disappointment even more... the bred was old and hard from the room Service. The only good thing about the hotel is the Location, but I would never come back",26-Mar-17,1
"The hotel staff here does an amazing job, from the check in staff, to the cleaning staff, they all have great customer service and do a great job. Great location(downtown) and easy to get uber to other locations in the city.",26-Mar-17,5
"We were return guests. Found location to be Very convenient, staff friendly, excellent food and club room amenities. Parking was available across the street at a reasonable rate. Will definitely return the next time we visit San Francisco!",24-Mar-17,4
"This is a beautiful, central location to stay in San Francisco. Our room had a great view of the bay and of the square. The staff was very helpful, especially the concierge, Joanna, who arranged several tours and made great recommendations for meals and how to get around the city. Our room was beautiful and immaculate. Great coffee bar in th morning. FYI - there is a charge for morning coffee and other snacks. The food in the restaurant is delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel for vacation or a business meeting. Thank you!",24-Mar-17,5
we have stayed there for the second time love the concierge floor the location is very convenient we rented a car for one day to hike in Muir woods Enterprise delivered the car to the hotel and it was super convenient,24-Mar-17,5
I was here with work attending a conference at the Moscone West centre which is about a 10 minute walk away. If you ask for a high floor the views from your room are great. Staff were very helpful and efficient.,23-Mar-17,4
"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Staff very courteous. Very central to where I needed to go. Easy, walking distance from Bart Station. Was not use to hearing sirens during the night. But that's city life. Unable to comment re: the food. Always fresh water and a refreshment in the lobby. Walking distance to the financial district. Everything was clean, well kept. Would stay again!",22-Mar-17,5
"Great location, great service and lovely room - upgraded to a king room which had a spectacular view of the city and a super comfy bed and pillows! As it was my birthday, the hotel staff treated us to a complimentary bottle of wine and strawberries, which was such a nice touch and really appreciated! Only negative would be that the bathrooms are not great, poor shower in the bath and could do with upgrading in our view and the bar was nice but lacked atmosphere and again was expensive but it's SF and Union Square, so I guess that's just normal. Would stay here again, as we were able to walk everywhere and we did - so if you are looking for a good base and somewhere comfortable to sleep, then this is a really good choice!",22-Mar-17,4
"Visited the city for a conference at the mascons center and had a pretty packed schedule. Hotel was within walking distance to great restaurants, the conference center, as well as the embarcadero.Best part was escaping up the elevator to a small bit of tranquility. Looking out the window you can see all the hustle and bustle, however it never reached inside the room.",21-Mar-17,4
"I was looking for somewhere to stay while we were in town for Hamilton musical. Although there were many options available for this particular weekend, I selected the Grand Hyatt because of it's central location and the Romance Package they offered. This particular package included champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, and breakfast either at the hotel restaurant or room service, with a late checkout of 3PM. The package came out to be a tremendous value for an excellent hotel. From check-in to check-out, we felt that we were treated like valued guests. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay here again. ",21-Mar-17,5
Room was disappointing. No Grand here. They should do a video chat with the Grand Hyatt in Orlando. Not worth the money. I have stayed at other highly rated San Francisco hotels and there is no comparison. ,21-Mar-17,2
"Was told upon check-in that our requested view of east side of hotel was granted and that we would be on the ""quiet side"" of the hotel. We got a room on the opposite side of what we requested and there was jack-hammering in the street below our room. Bed topper had small holes in it that allowed feathers to escape and I had tiny feathers in my hair when I woke up the next day. I had to use the earplugs provided by the hotel to even attempt sleep due to the jack-hammering and bag pipe playing in union square. And we were on the 33rd floor and could still hear the noise on the so-called ""quiet side"" of the hotel as we were told by our check-in person. We stay here many times during the year but did not feel appreciated at all this stay.",21-Mar-17,3
"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, we reserved a top view room. Great time spent here, room was comfortable and service was good. They did take a while to get our room ready about an hour or so. The hotel is pretty central, lots of shops near by.",21-Mar-17,4
"Easy to get checked in> Parking lot across street, charged to hotel, before getting checked in so easy! Great view. World Class Shopping, Dining, China Town , Harbor walking distance from hotel. Staff quick, smart, intuitive, Highly recommend. Has a gym that looks out over the bridge- makes for astounding workout-it is on 35th floor. View from top floor incredible!",21-Mar-17,5
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Grand Hyatt in Union Square during St. Patrick's weekend, which we didn't even know about. From where we were dropped off by the taxi, the hotel seems nowhere to be found due to lack of signage showing ""Grand Hyatt"". Mind you, the hotel is located in a very busy intersection so you can get easily get distracted. I recommend branding the hotel from the main entrance point of view, too. However, I noticed OneUp in the main entrance. As we walk in, we were helped and welcomed by 2 gentlemen, whom I unfortunately forgot to recognize. We waited for maybe 5 or so minutes until helped by the front desk. Our front desk was Michaela and she was very delightful and professional in her demeanor. No dull moment! The room was pretty fancy, to say the least! The only downside is that, there were cobwebs underneath the bathroom sink, a stain in our bed and another permanent red stain on the automatic curtain. The first night was superb, but the night after that, the noise from the next door neighbor was annoying (considering we marked ""quiet room"" as our request when we made the online reservation). We called front desk (Michaela picked up) and was offered to be moved, since we have a lot of luggage, she just sent a security which greatly helped to quiet down the neighbors next to us who were loud and obnoxious. Overall, the experience was amazing! It seemed like a short stay, but definitely memorable and positive. I wouldn't mind staying in this hotel and I will definitely recommend this facility to my friends and others!!! :)",21-Mar-17,5
"This hotel is right next to the Union Square, the new Apple store and in walking distance of the Moscone Convention Center (5-6min walk). Also Market Street is just down 2 blocks. Really great location.Rooms are modern and newly renovated. Staff is very friendly and helpful.The gym is a bit basic and a pool is missing. If you look for a 5-Star experience you need to move to the Hyatt Regency a bit further down town.",19-Mar-17,4
"We stayed at quite a few Hyatt poperties back in the 90s then went to Sofitel, Intercontinental, Westin & Marriott. We decided to stay at the Park Hyatt Dubai and Hyatt Regency London - the best stays ever - both pretty amazing!We decided to use the accrued points for a stay at the Grand Hyatt SF - no comparision to the other hotels. No soul, no personality, the room was on the 24th floor and very minimalistic and dusty. When we got the bill under the door it also included another bill for the room next door - when I brough ti to reception - no apology - gave the impression this is a common occurence! Thanks goodness it was free!We are going back to Intercontinental San Francisco - much higher class hotel in SF!",18-Mar-17,3
"Right on Union Square and next to the new apple store you find this huge hotel. If you book ""Grand Club"" you will enjoy the most marvellous view of San Francisco during your free breakfast at the Club. The hotel is what you have to expect from the Hyatt chain of hotels. You pay for excellence regarding service and that is what you get. We most enjoyed being able to discover the city by foot. We found 65 USD rather steep to have your car parked over night, but that seems to be the price you have to pay for sleeping downtown.",18-Mar-17,4
"Good location near all transport, shopping etc. Clean rooms with good views, just noisey from inconsiderate neighbours and doors banging throughout the corridor. There are plenty of restaurants and places to eat, the tram is a three minute walk and the hop on hop off buses are behind the hotel at union square.",17-Mar-17,3
"My family and I stayed her for 4 nights during our spring break. We upgraded to a VIP suite and club which was well worth it! We had a huge room with large sitting area and perfect view! Our room was quiet and clean! Our favorite part of our whole trip was the Club breakfast, snacks, appetizers, and drinks. Wow, the service from the staff (especially Ben and Dave) was top notch. No wait at elevators and centrally located. Highly recommend!",17-Mar-17,5
"Grand Hyatt is clean, great views, friends staff. Sometimes you can hear other patrons in the hallway or even above you but for the most part it's relatively quiet. I stay here for work and the lounge is a wonderful feature (although their coffee is anything but desirable, especially in SF).",17-Mar-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt hotel is located in Union Square. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are fabulous, large and comfortable. For a small extra charge when available, it is worth upgrading to one of the top floors as the views are spectacular. Breakfast has an excellent selection of fresh food.",15-Mar-17,5
"Booked a standard room at hyatt.com and went for an upgrade to exec/suiteCheckin: Easy. Checkin at 3pmCheckout: Standard, OkRoom: Huge room incll. separate living room and second bathroom. 29th floor, view a bit boring. Bed was fine, should be ok for good sleeping. AC fine. Furniture a bit worn. Room was super noisy due to elevator. Not possible to sleep without ear plugs.Location: Easy to walk from/to BART.Overall: Doormen perfect. Checkin/out ok, Hotel seems to be overrated, but you get what you pay for. Seems that the price difference to St. Regis or Ritz Carlton is well founded. Not sure if I will come back.",14-Mar-17,3
"I stayed there for 4 nights for my business trip. I rushed to the airport after check-out, and then realized I forgot my leather jacket in the closet. After sending inquiry, it turned out my jacket was not found and I found out the similar case had happened here. For reference,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d80999-r311668329-Grand_Hyatt_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.htmlI don't want to claim it's stolen but I can hardly think of other possibilities because I am so sure I hanged it in the closet but forgot to pack it in my suicase. My room was tucked away at the end of a hallway, the same as the case above. Maybe this kind of rooms should be avoided. Guests should be careful while staying here and check all your belongings before check-out because you'll be less likely to get them back, even though this is a high-end hotel.",14-Mar-17,2
I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Best of all for me was the location set back one block from Union Square. The staff was friendly and the lobby was clean. I felt the rooms were a little small and I'm not a huge fan of shower curtains but but we enjoyed our stay here and I would definitely stay again based on location and price.,14-Mar-17,4
"Friendly staff upon check in and check out, very clean and great location. Walking distance to great shopping and restaurants. The cable car stop is across the street, so the transportation is easy. I would stay here again and recommend this hotel.",14-Mar-17,5
Hyatt's select testing of their Mobile Entry service allowed me to designate my arrival/check-in time so I could head straight to my room and use my iPhone to unlock the door. Centrally located with clean and comfy rooms; hard to stay elsewhere.,14-Mar-17,5
Noisy corridors with slamming doorsLate in the night..... two nights in a row.Rooms are clean and spacious withall the amenities expected of this type of hotel. Close to all the shopping and minutes from Fisherman's Wharf.A good choice with a pleasant staff,13-Mar-17,3
"We booked the Club level room and it was well worth it, great view and nice to have breakfast included.Perfect home base for visit to SF. Close enough to walk to many locations but you will need cabs too.",13-Mar-17,5
"I attended an unrelated conference at Hyatt SFO--but I also am in the hospitality business. I found service to be excellent, staff friendly and eager to help. Concierge services made wonderful suggestions. Room was very nice and had a great view. I had a 5 star experience in the city.",13-Mar-17,5
"I had a great trip, the location is really ideal! Our room was clean and comfortable and we had a great view. The concierge helped set us up with a great tour to Muir Woods, she was very nice and helpful so it was a pleasure working with her. She even gave us advice on restaurants and take away in the area. Overall the stay at the hotel was great, my only complaint would be that the toilet paper was of very poor quality and for 4 star at those prices you would expect all the amenities to be 4 star but that is just a little thing. ",13-Mar-17,5
"I don't often stay at Hyatt properties, and quite rarely at their higher-end ones. But this was the hotel for a conference I was attending, so it was chosen for me by my company. From check-in, to dining, to check-out, the experience here was fantastic. Check-in personnel accommodated my wacky room preferences, and while the breakfast in the restaurant on-property (OneUP) was a little spendy, it was delicious and professionally served. My guest room was simply superb. The layout was nice, the space well designed and open, the bed comfortable, the environment quiet. Even the bathroom was pleasant, with lots of room, and nice amenities. I really liked the modern design of the room, and in fact, of the entire property. Since I was here for a conference, I can even confirm that the meeting spaces were quite nice. My only criticism of them is that they are below-ground, so you need to come upstairs to get some sunlight, but it's not like there are windows in most above-ground convention spaces, so a bit of an unfair comment.In any case, a very pleasant stay in a very pleasant hotel, and one I'd not hesitate to recommend.",10-Mar-17,5
"Although the hotel is reasonably priced, the food is far more expensive than it should be. On the other hand, San Francisco restaurants are little better. The hotel is situated in a great part of the city, the staff is very welcoming, and the hotel is modern and beautiful.",8-Mar-17,5
"Very helpful and friendly staff, comfortable beds, clean and quiet. beautiful view of the city from my room that I enjoyed while just having a coffee and enjoying the view in the comfortable chair and foot rest next to the glass Sliders in my room",8-Mar-17,5
"I have stayed here many times, for both business and vacation, and I love everything about this hotel. Sometimes the price of rooms prohibits a stay, but I always try to figure out a way. The convincing things are the friendly staff, the clean, uncluttered dÃ©cor, good food, and the perfect location for shopping, walking, transportation, and all the energy of downtown.",8-Mar-17,5
My wife and I enjoyed a weekend getaway at the Grand Hyatt SF. The hotel is conveniently located on Stockton off Market just north of Union Square. The hotel was updated a few years ago and has a warm modern theme throughout. We chose a 2 Room/ 2 Bathroom Mini-Suite on the 26th Floor. The room was extremely comfortable and the views were spectacular. The Grand Hyatt SF is our San Francisco hotel of choice !!,7-Mar-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt is well located near Union Square, the shopping district.Our room was clean and spacious and the bed very comfortable.Good water pressure in the shower.Great service from the staff, especially the door staff.",5-Mar-17,4
"The Grand Hyatt is located in Union Square and is very close to a ton of stores, BART, and Chinatown. My favorite part about this location is Boba Guys is right down the street! Rooms are surprisingly pretty big. I stayed at another hotel just a block away from the Grand Hyatt almost 2 years ago and it was much smaller. I didn't realize that most of the rooms are connected until I talked to one of the front desk agents. While he reassured me there was no way that the guest in the next room would have access to my room, he graciously moved me to a non-connecting room. I have a tendency to forget a lot of things when I pack, so it was nice that I was able to request for some amenities and that a hotel staff could deliver it to my room within 10-20 minutes. A little pricey, but I do recommend staying here, especially if you're a solo traveler who is looking to stay in a safe area.",4-Mar-17,4
"Generally a nice place to stay. The location is very convenient to everything. My room was just fine. Still, I didn't feel like I received Hyatt typical room set up for frequent guest as in others. Restaurant service and food excellent ",4-Mar-17,4
"We enjoyed the location, pretty easy drive from the airport (at non rush hour times for us). We found many great locations to shop and dine easily within walking distance. Valet is expensive anywhere of course.Staff was great, breakfast was very good, open kitchen, better than average buffet, even for a Hyatt.One tip, pay the little bit extra and get the Executive Suite, its a really nice room, even for just one or two people.I have stayed here twice within the last month, once alone, once with my family of 4, both times it was terrific. It will be our new go-to place for San Fran visits!",4-Mar-17,5
Stayed here for the last night hoorah prior to getting married. Staff was very welcoming and helping. The room was perfect they even had a treat wait for us when we checked in to our room. Will stay again. ,4-Mar-17,5
"This hotel did everything right from start to finish! We were given the opportunity to upgrade our view, and it was worth every penny. We were on the 29th floor and had a Bay View that extended all the way out to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. Near Pier 39 was Coit Tower. To our right was a close-up of the Pyramid Building. The cable cars were conveniently close by. We called room service and told them what we wanted since we didn't see a menu, and the meal was so good that we had it three days in a row! Outstanding service, comfortable bed - highly recommended!",2-Mar-17,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in mid-February 2017. The hotel was very clean, the staff very helpful and attentive.My room was ready when I arrived at noon and had everything I needed. We drank in the bar and had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant. All experiences were good. The food was good, the wait staff were quick, and the price was reasonable.",2-Mar-17,5
"The quite Luxurious hotel is centrally located in Union Square. It is very close to all major Downtown Shops, Cable Cars great Pubs and Bars and Great Food.The Room has the Automatic Blinds from bed.stayed for 2 days in June 2016. pretty good Hotel to stay.",2-Mar-17,5
"We picked the Grand Hyatt for the location...close to Union Square and walking distance to everything (shopping, dining, Ferry Market Building etc) Our stay was short as we were in the Bay area to primarily for a Sonoma wine tour (more about that in another review) The room was modern, bathroom was clean and the we were lucky enough to have a fantastic view of Union Square. The coffee bar in the lobby was very convenient - it's open early and they serve Starbucks. There are some food options - fruit, bagels (there's a toaster) breakfast sandwiches. There is also a Starbucks right across the street. A big thanks to the friendly bellmen...we had a lot of luggage (most of it wine) and they were so helpful and very efficient getting us loaded and unloaded. The only downside was the thin walls in the hotel room. You can hear everything...and I mean everything. It might be due to the fact that we were an end hallway room but at least the loud guests beside us departed the next day after our arrival. It didn't ruin our stay and luckily we had earplugs. ",1-Mar-17,4
Easy check in. Very polite and accommodating staff. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast selection is good at the hotel Restaurant.. Close to all Downtown highlight spots.Was able to get to the hotel using Public Transport from the Airport. Close to cable cars and bus once at the Hotel.,1-Mar-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt SF is a comfortable hotel located a block north of Union Square and surrounded by a ton of shops. The week I stayed here, the rate was unjustifiably expensive due to low availability at all hotels in the area but the hotel is worth a stay if you find a decent rate. The service in the lobby was friendly and mostly efficient. The gym was adequate with a fair number of machines and free weights. My room had a stellar view and was mostly up to date with a comfy bed. My only complaint with the room was the low water pressure. I thoroughly enjoyed the club lounge which was never crowded and at mealtimes had a great variety of options - one of the better club lounges as far as Grand Hyatts go. The breakfast is excellent and featured bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, cereal, bagels, etc. The evening featured one hot dish such as gnocchi along with cheese, cookies, and more. I found this the best amenity of the hotel. A great place to sit and enjoy the view towards the bay.",27-Feb-17,4
Had room 3217. Killer view of SF. Automated blinds/lights from bed. Check in folks were super nice. so-so part of town. Good food in bar. Great roll-in shower. I would go back if I had meetings around there,27-Feb-17,4
"Trying to be a 5 star hotel but is lacking a few things to make it one of the top notch hotels in SF. Location - 5Right in the middle of downtown SF, most everything you need is in walking distance. If not it's a short cab ride to the wharf. Comfort - 3Noise from the hallway seeps into the room too clearly. Bed and sheets are nice but comforter is a little weathered. Misc - 3Bar and restaurant is fair but a little small. Club lounge is nice and selection of free drinks are plentiful. Not really the hotels fault but smell of weed was so prominent in my room most of the time I was there",26-Feb-17,3
The hotel was excellent. It is centrally located and convenient for business. I had my family traveling with me and we were able to be accommodated as well. Overall I have stayed at this hotel a few times and always found it easy to find and a great place to stay,26-Feb-17,5
Their computers don't work and you will have a terrible hassle checking out. they will tell you your credit card doesn't work and then after a half hour will say it was their computer not working. It is reasonably located near the Moscone Center but stay somewhere else for good service.,25-Feb-17,1
"I would have given the Grand Hyatt a much better rating but, unfortunately, the night I spent there was quite stormy. In bed I kept hearing a crackling noise coming from the ceiling that made it impossible to go to sleep. I finally called the front desk and they advised me that this was part of the building's earthquake protection and what I was hearing was the building swaying in the wind. Obviously protecting against an earthquake is critical but there has to be a better way. I have stayed San Francisco on windy nights in the past in buildings that did not make noise. I asked other guests if they heard the same thing and everyone replied the same way: ""yes and I did not sleep at all"".Besides that, the hotel was fine except the fitness center was far too small to accommodate the guest numbers in the morning.",25-Feb-17,2
"We arrived shortly after 1pm. There was a problem with the computer system so it took a bit longer to check us in. However, Ron at the front desk was really nice, and another lady came to help us with the check-in. They know that it's for my partner's birthday, and Ron gave us drink coupons and free food, and upgraded us to a bay view room! The view is amazing, and the room is very spacious and clean. So far we're really enjoying our stay, and glad that we chose to stay here. Thank you. ",25-Feb-17,5
"Of the various San Francisco hotels in which I have stayed (including one two blocks away), this is my least favorite. It started with our having a difficult time navigating the practically non-existent valet parking area. The hotel is in a heavily congested area at the intersection of two really busy one-way streets, with absolutely no off-street loading and unloading area. Inexplicably, the hotel's main entrance/valet area isn't even marked -- we drove by it the first time not realizing it is the hotel's main entrance, and had to navigate through several blocks of heavily congested traffic all over again to circle all the way back around and try again. After finally getting the car squared away, the reception area was nice enough, but in an effort to be modern looking, it also was a bit disorganized. There was no formal queue as such, and people kept cutting in what should have been the line. The room itself was a disappointment. I have stayed in a number of Grand Hyatts around the country and typically find them to be a significant cut above the standard Hyatt or Hyatt Regency, but did not get that impression upon entering this room. It was small, the ceiling relatively low, and the furnishings felt anything but upscale. The bathroom likewise was on the small side and seemed more like a standard mid-range hotel rather than a Grand Hyatt. The bathroom also did not feel as clean as it should have, with numerous rust stains and other stains in various places. The walls of the guest room were incredibly thin and anything but soundproof. I could hear nearly everything happening in the adjacent room, and assume they could do likewise. I wouldn't even call my wife from the room because I did not feel like I had any privacy. This is downtown San Francisco and rooms can be on the small side, but I have stayed in peer hotels in the immediate vicinity that felt much more luxurious and comfortable. For what I paid, I was disappointed, and likely would not stay here again.",25-Feb-17,3
"On February 06, we checked into the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, on Stockton St., just above Union Sq. for my wifeâ€™s business meetings in the China Basin area.This was our second stay at the Grand Hyatt, after they had a major refurbishment, and the first was also in February, but a year earlier.The curb area, in front of the hotel was very full and active, but our driver managed to squeeze in, and the bellman was immediately on the spot, to retrieve our luggage. Check-in was very efficient (I still cannot get used to the large table in the lobby, with the reservation agentsâ€™ computers, but the look is very clean, and all seems to be smooth). As we are Hyatt Platinum members, we were upgraded to the 33rd floor. While our room, 3323 had good views, the weather precluded viewing much.The room was fairly spacious, and the dÃ©cor, while modernist, was attractive. This room was very similar to the one that we had on the 25th floor, in 2016. There is a sitting area, then separate bathroom with a glass-door closet in the connecting hallway. While an individual room, the layout makes it seem as though itâ€™s a suite. The King bed was very comfortable, and my wife appreciated the walk-in shower. The bathroom had a frosted glass â€œbarn door,â€ù which some might not like, but being off of the little hallway, did not present a problem. The room featured a desk, with adequate charging outlets for our devices, and a flat-screen TV.Being Platinum members got us into the very nice Lounge.The hotel is very conveniently located, being one half block from Union Square. It is located in a fairly flat area, so no major hills to negotiate. On our previous stay, there was a great deal of construction on both Stockton, and the Apple Store, next door. Even with a west-facing room, on the 25th floor, noise from the construction could be heard. That is all now history, and all was quiet in this room. Unfortunately, the exterior of the building was being cleaned, so there were scaffold units, and plastic sheeting over many surfaces, but these were only visual issues, and not one sound was heard from any work.As always, the entire staff was excellent, and made us feel very welcome. We enjoyed the stay, and will return.",24-Feb-17,4
We had a great 4 night stay at the Grand Hyatt. Our room was very nice! I am a clean freak and I search a room VERY thouroughly before I set my bags down. The room was exceptionally clean and met my unrealistic expectations. The linens on the bed were stain free and the towels actually did not scratch my skin. My husband and I went and hand drinks in the restaurant one evening and the bartenders were great!!,24-Feb-17,5
"Our check was so fast, all of the front desk people were very friendly and made the check in process extremely fast. One of the ladies saw we had children and sent us up some cookies and milk for them - that was so nice. We were on the 19th floor and had a great view of the city. Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable. All the bellmen were very nice during our stay and the concierges were amazing with their recommendations. I wish the 36th floor bar wasn't closed. We did sneak up there and look around at the amazing views, but it would be nice if there were a restaurant or bar up there. This hotel is in walking distance of many fine stores and restaurants. I would definitely come back.",23-Feb-17,5
I was attending a conference and my wife decided to join me. I was lucky enough to get a room here as all the other hotels were sold out and/or had extremely high rates that my employer would not reimburse me for. Somehow I lucked up and got this hotel at a decent rate and they did not disappoint. Everything from the staff to the location to the room itself fit our needs.,23-Feb-17,4
"We weren't quite sure how the hotel was going to be for us since we were traveling with an infant but it turned out to be great. The housekeeping staff made are room more than infant friendly. They provided us with all of our needs just like were we're at home. If traveling with kids just let them know ahead of time and they will make the stay easier. Located across from a Starbucks which never had a wait, next to a McDonalds if you need an easy quick bite to eat and across from a CVS if you need anything else that you may have forgot at home. Overall a great stay. ",22-Feb-17,4
"The walls were paper thin. It sounded like the people next to us and the ice machine accross the hall were in the room with us. We wound up requesting a new room after the people next to us kept us up all night. They were not especially loud, just talking all night long and we could hear every word. The matress was uncomfortable. The shower had weak water pressure that often loss the hot water. I'm also pretty sure i saw two homeless people sleeping on the sofa in the lobby",22-Feb-17,1
"The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco has been nicely updated, to what is already a prime location next to Union Square shopping district in San Francisco. Walking distance from a variety of shops and restaurants and nearby transportation options across the city.",22-Feb-17,4
"About five days prior to arrival, I received a kind email from the great experience manager of the Grand Hyatt (Andrew Kim), anticipating our arrival and asking if there was anything we needed in advance. In my response, I mentioned that we would be arriving at 12:30 pm from a long flight from the East Coast and if he could note a request for early check in for our two adjoining rooms if possible, and to provide a list of GF restaurants in the area. Within 24 hours, I received a response from Mr Kim telling me he would do his best to accommodate our early check in and a second email from Anne Sullivan, a concierge at the hotel, with GF restaurant suggestions. Very impressive start -- and we had not yet arrived. From the moment my family arrived, we were greeted warmly by the valet, bellhops and front desk. Steve checked us in and was incredibly nice. Our rooms were in fact ready for us ahead of scheduled check in time. And when Steve learned that we had a birthday celebration, the hotel sent wine and strawberries with chocolate sauce to our room. Our rooms were tastefully appointed, clean and well lit with super comfortable beds. The hotel lobby had a warm beautiful design and modern decor with fireplaces and tvs. It's location was ideal to many tourist attractions and great shopping (to which we did not avail ourselves). The concierges were helpful with restaurant suggestions and driving instructions. I would definitely return to this hotel, largely because of the exceptional service we received during our two night stay. My only one complaint was the steep overnight parking fee. ",22-Feb-17,5
The hotel wasn't at the standard level of service and value. Even though the hotel was renovated recently but the quality of materials used to renovate was cheap. Very expensive for nothing. No value for money. Not recommended. ,20-Feb-17,2
"This was my first time in San Francisco and when travelling, Hyatt properties are one of the properties I try to stay. This Hyatt property is a great oasis while in San Francisco, first and foremost is the location. The hotel is right downtown and therefore near the shopping areas. This is particularly convenient on days when it rains. In addition, you are close to the cable cars to Fishermans Wharf, Market Street, short cab ride to Castro, and Chinatown is a 10 minute walk. It doesn't matter how great the location is if there isn't an exquisite staff to man the property. Every employee that I encountered at this hotel was wonderful but I need to call out the manager of the guest lounge on the 32nd floor. This gentleman is an asset, he is charming, well knowledge and knows customer service. The lounge was overflowing on weekend I was here but he gave individualized attention to everyone. In addition the lounge is well appointed and comfortable. The evening cocktails and hordeuvres was almost like a meal, the continental breakfast was more of a full breakfast. If you need to get a workout in while here then the Gym will not disappoint you, though small it is jam filled with all the equipment one needs, including a Smith Machine. If running is on your schedule then the hills here will really give you a workout and running along the wharf will visually stimulate you as well. All in all this is a great property for the price.",20-Feb-17,4
"Stayed here for 1 week in November with Family. I booked the 1 bedroom suite with adjoining room, turning it into a 2 bedroom suite with 3 bathrooms. The suite had lots of space, well appointed and had beautiful view of the city. Really enjoyed our welcome amenity in the suite of Cheese Board and Craft Beers. Used the Grand Club lounge daily. It has good spread of food for breakfast and afternoon snacks. The views from the Grand Club are also amazing, overlooking the harbor. Enjoyed the location, right at union square which made for easy travel around the city.",20-Feb-17,4
"Everything you want - great service, fantastic views, great location and great food.I was checked in by a charming local gentleman who gave us an fantastic room with a view overlooking union square.The room was faultless.I lost my charger on the way to the hotel, a quick call to concierge and one was delivered to my room to borrow.Great location, you can walk to all the different districts of the Bay Area, or a short taxi ride can get you there in no time.",20-Feb-17,5
"We stayed on the 27th floor and we Loved the view! We got the Romance Package so it came with the champagne and chocolate strawberries. Breakfast and also late check out was very much needed. Everything was beautiful. Check in was fast, staff were very friendly. Ordered my boyfriends birthday cheesecake a little before the restaurant closed but they were kind enough to bring it fast with a candle and matches. Breakfast was yummy. We ordered the mission st breakfast burrito and the corned beef hash. We're coming back for sure and I'd definitely recommend Grand Hyatt to anyone who asks. ",20-Feb-17,5
"I highly recommend staying at this Hyatt location for several reasons. The staff, rooms, food and cleanliness were all outstanding. Better than the norm and we really enjoyed our stay in San Francisco.",20-Feb-17,5
"Had a lovely one night stay in a VIP suite overlooking Union Square. The Grand Club lounge had a really nice spread for breakfast and the most/best drink choices I've experienced in a hotel executive lounge. Food quality was high and selection was more than enough. The view from the lounge was pretty impressive as well. The location is very central downtown SF surrounded by shopping. The Nike store diagonally across the street had some nice, exclusive items and there's high end, shopping all around from Paul Smith to Rimowa to Neiman Marcus. Went to a wonderful seafood restaurant nearby called Farallon which was recommended by the concierge. Delicious, locally inspired and sourced food.",20-Feb-17,5
The hotel overall needs to be updated. The price to value was poor and one should look at other options within San Francisco before committing to a reservation. When checking in try to not get a corner room; ask for something that has a view towards the water. The location is good and convenient to most attractions.,19-Feb-17,3
"This hotel was a wonderful surprise with well appointed rooms and outstanding service. When we mentioned that we were there to celebrate our daughter's birthday, they sent cupcakes to our room! Request a high floor room, and you'll get an expansive view of the city and Bay. The location is excellent, right on the Cable Car line. The only thing I'd mention is if you get a bed with two rooms, the beds are only full size, so it's squishy for two folks to share one. If you're tall, ask for a room with a king or queen.",18-Feb-17,5
Came up for Chinese New Year parade. This hotel has the best location since the parade goes right by the hotel The staff is terrific. Really enjoyed our stay. The hotel needs some updating I have stayed here before and will return. The other positive about the location are the proximity to Union Square and shopping. The is a Starbucks right across the street.,17-Feb-17,4
"Ok place to stay if they have a special room rate offer. Clean rooms no complaints & good service as well. Only complaint is that bath room was dated and not really 4 star. Bathrooms are older with tub and shower curtain like you would find in a budget motel. Sink in bathroom was a ""post modern"" attempt at ""design"" Water splashed and it was a nuisance. No luxury in the bath . I would stay here again but only if the rates were a good offer. Great location on Union Square is the main attraction. Ok, but a not a ""special"" experience.",16-Feb-17,3
"The food is not great, and very overpriced, the prices of things, at least when I was there, were labeled incorrectly leaving me with a $30 bill for salad and water, not okay. My room was dirty. I moved rooms twice and both were extremely noisy. It was not worth the nightly expense.",16-Feb-17,2
"Fantastic location for a SF getaway. Staff was attentive and made the visit very enjoyable. We had a suite and it was very comfortable for a group of four. Room was very clean, spacious and quiet. We were at hotel during Chinese New Year parade and even with all the craziness surrounding the hotel, it was great. The hotels close proximity to Union Square was perfect. We came for East Bay and took BART in to city. Getting off at Powell street station it was a short walk to Hyatt.",15-Feb-17,5
Check in was seamless and very accommodating. Rooms were clean and updated. Perfect for couples and families. We were there for Chinese New Year. Would highly recommend and will definetly stay there again. ,14-Feb-17,5
"The hotel crew, the room, everything was great. I went for a business trip and It was amazing. The only concern I had was because I stayed close to the Staff Room and I had problems with the noise, but I didn't complain about that so I don't know if they would have moved to another room. The location is the best, way better thn Hilton for example. It's right close to Union Square, in the same sidewalk as Apple store and walking distance to other stores and Westfield mall.",14-Feb-17,5
"For a union square property, this place manages to create an oasis within the city. From the check in through the checkout process they have nearly perfected the hospitality. The club room was well equipped as was the club lounge. The staff was very attentive and the atmosphere was great. The only two things that I feel the hotel could do better was not to charge a meagerly $3 for a glass of wine in the club room. No other hotel that I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world charges for the wine in the club lounge. Seating in the lounge was a problem because of the number of people. Again, something the hotel should look into. But the property has been updated and it is fresh.",13-Feb-17,5
"We found the staff attentive and efficient. Enjoyed breakfast and dinner in the OneUp dining room. Very convenient location in Union Square. There was always someone available to get a cab, provide umbrellas, get a car for the airport. ",13-Feb-17,5
"I would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt Union Square again. Very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. We used our points to upgrade to the club rooms. The lounge was small but decent. Rooms well sized and pleasant, location good, staff helpful.",13-Feb-17,5
"This hotel met all requirements and expectations. The room was a good size with a window the whole size of the wall so it was bright with a great view over the city (we were on 25th floor). Everything you'd expect in a 4 star city hotel was there. The location of this hotel was excellent. It is right beside an apple shop and the other side of that is Union Square where you get city tour buses, etc. Macy's is just across the square and there are restaurants within a few minutes walk in any direction. There is a breakfast shop each morning in the lobby where you can get coffee, fruit, croissants etc. The concierge is most helpful. Check-in is easy and efficient. The only downside we experienced were the doormen who are fairly inefficient and careless ( at best!)",13-Feb-17,3
"Enjoyed long weekend at Grand Hyatt. We used Diamond Upgrade to the Deluxe Suite which was like an apartment with over 900 sq feet. Views were spectacular with Knob Hill and Alcatraz in site. Living room comes with sofa, wine bar, and personal Apple computer. Bedroom was comfortable with automatic shades in both rooms. Bathroom was large with shower, dual sinks and great toiletries.Gym as functional with great views. It was quite popular around 7-8. Treadmills, elliptical, bikes free weights, a few machines are all available. The club level offers wide variety of menu items for both breakfast and happy hour. Alcohol is on honor system but at reduced cost. Wine was 3.00 each but in my opinion beer/wine should be free. Location is great within 1 block of Union Square and 3 blocks to Market Street. Staff are friendly, check in was fast and rooms comfortable. I would consider Hyatt again for my next visit.",12-Feb-17,5
"A great hotel at a great rate. Perfect Union Square location. Room is fresh and clean and has great views. Bed are firm but very comfortable, quality linens and both soft and firm pillow choices. The green tea and cucumber toiletries were pleasant start each morning. Front desk was amazing. Literally saying yes to very request. As a bonus, the Chinese New Years parade went literally around the hotel. I could watch some from the room, some from the street, some from the bar. And another bonus, the hotel share a great communal area with the Apple Store. And free wifi!",12-Feb-17,4
"I can't say enough about this hotel, it was fantastic! The staff were incredibly friendly- so approachable and eager to help- the room had an excellent view and the building itself is centrally located so pretty much everything is within walking distance. I would recommend this hotel to all.",10-Feb-17,5
The ambiance is lovely. The service and rooms are great. The location is excellent. The food is expensive and with all the extra taxes and charges exploring options outside the hotel makes sense. The business lounge is very nice but the food choices could be better. I have stayed at this chain overseas which are better in terms of the food.,10-Feb-17,4
"This is a great hotel, which I'm very happy to recommend. The location is superb being right on Union Square so very close to shopping and an easy walk to the financial district. The rooms are modern and clean but still with a sense of warmth and style - really like foyer too with the fire places, couches and leather chairs. I had a view room on the 30th floor with water and Bay Bridge glimpses. The rooms are a decent size with good desk space for working and the gym on the 35th floor has excellent views. I couldn't fault the service from the front desk, doormen and bell staff who were all very polite and helpful. I did experience some of the creaking that others have mentioned from the building swaying in the wind but that and the rain didn't dampen my experience.",9-Feb-17,5
"Superb location, nice rooms but best of all was the incredibly friendliness and can do attitude of staff. Superb! Also being a Gold member gave access to the Lounge that was well equipped with once again very friendly staff.",8-Feb-17,5
This is my 5th stay in San Fran at this time of year but first stay at the Hyatt. The room has creaked constantly all night as the building has been built to sway in the wind. Every joist in the room squeaks. ALL NIGHT Front desk won't move me to quieter room as they say all rooms are noisy. I've got to tolerate another 3 nights of this and front desk have only offered me ear plugs. I'll go back to the Hilton next time. At least you get a good nights sleep. ,7-Feb-17,1
"I had VIP suite on the 34th floor with amazing views of the city! The staff was very welcoming and very accommodating. Definitely worth every penny I paid. Only disclaimer is the parking ($45 a night) is contracted to a parking garage, and not connected to the hotel, made luggage logistics a little tricky. But I would still come back!",7-Feb-17,5
"Why stay anywhere else? Best combination of value, comfort and superb service. We stayed here as an overnight enroute from Cincinnati to Hawaii.we had special needs due to some medical requirements and the staff were exemplary in assisting us. ",6-Feb-17,5
The hotel was comfortable and the staff friendly and the location great. If you want tranquility then you're never going to find this downtown so aim for a room above the 20th floor to get the best compromise. The view from the viewing room on the 36 floor is impressive.,6-Feb-17,4
"I was really impressed with the size of the room for San Francisco given the price. Plenty of bathroom, closet, and work space. Lots of outlets on the desk and near the bed. Soundproofing was good even with a connecting door. Northern view from the 15th floor was pretty good, and I'm sure would be spectacular from the 25th and up. The doormen and bellstaff were courteous and helpful in providing information. I'm not crazy about the union square area, but if you are, this location couldn't be beat. it was still very easy to walk to financial district as well as the 2 very close BART stations. Never had to wait for an elevator. Never had to wait long on the phone to get to an operator. Great experience and I do reccomend!",6-Feb-17,5
"Good location, but building functionality need to be upgraded. Room sound insulation- a major problem, Bathroom sink allow splashing all over vanity counter, Elevator waiting time slow, Grand club small for the hotel. Lower level meeting room traffic interfere's with hotel room guests.",6-Feb-17,3
"I have again and again stayed at Grand Hyatt in San Francisco and I never get tired of that perfect located hotel. Always a friendly welcome and even it is a hotel with many rooms, you still feel a cozy atmosphere. The rooms are very, very nice and I think all have a great view. Even if I try, I canÂ´t find things I want to be better. If you want to spend a little bit more, purchase access to the Lounge on the 32nd floor - it is worth it. Lea",5-Feb-17,5
"To be honest I've been unimpressed with most hotels in S.F. and I've stayed in quite a few. My expectations of the Grand Hyatt were modest, after all the Hyatt Regency failed to impress me a few years ago, so I expected the same or less from the Grand Hyatt. The truth was the property impressed from the first moment - literally - the doormen made you feel welcome upon arrival, a feeling that continued to check in and to the room. The room itself was average size, what I liked though was that the hotel while tall has a very small footprint, so no long hallways. All rooms are 20 steps from the elevator core. Back to the room, as said, average size but obviously decorated recently with some very nice touches. Bathroom was larger than usual and very nicely decorated in marble and tile. Nice, very nice. WiFi was only so so but the wired network was reasonably fast for actual work.Breakfast everyday was at the very small One Up which served a very nice buffet though the price was an eye watering $25 pp. Not sure I'd say it was worth all that. But that's a nit. The hotel is a block off of Union Square, a great location. This will be my go to hotel in San Francisco for the future not only would I go back, but I look forward to doing so.The hotel does not have parking, but there is a large public garage diagonal from the hotel. Valet parking is available, but I'd rather do it myself and save the difference for breakfast.",5-Feb-17,5
"Nice hotel, but the Hyatt is terrible value. Just short of $500 per night with taxes for a four night stay. Taxes are about 20%. Much better values closer to Moscone Center and less expensive. Room prices really changed with a reservation change so beware.",5-Feb-17,2
"This is our second time staying here, with the first time being right after their renovation in 2015 I believe. As a Diamond member staying during a weekend when the hotel had lots of available rooms, I was disappointed that I had to request upgrade to a room with Union Square room (instead of just a room on a high floor). Nevertheless, the view is breathtaking, and the room is very comfortable. It is very befitting a Grand Hyatt although far from the best Grand Hyatt I've seen.Front Desk arrangement is a bit difficult to navigate as there is not a separate desk for Diamond/Platinum members so I had to wait in the line a bit to be checked in. The mobile check-in app offered for my stay did not work at all. I think this property has quite a bit of room for improvement if it wants to be a go-to hotel for folks.All in all, the stay was good enough, but not quite excellent.",4-Feb-17,4
"I was at the Grand Hyatt for a whole business week.The Hotel is of high standard and the rooms at higher levels have a nice view over the bay.Very central and walking distance from the city highlights (SFMOMA, shopping centers, restaurants).",4-Feb-17,5
Amazing hotel right next to Union Square. My room was big especially for San Fran standards. The bathroom was nice and modern looking. The staff put plenty of towels which was awesome. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were nice and firm. The service was outstanding. Everyone was so nice and helpful. There is complimentary bottle water at all times!! The best part of this hotel was the amazing gym on the 35th floor. The gym looked out to the bay. Absolutely beautiful views to keep you motivated while working out. Thank you for the amazing stay and I will only look to stay here when I come back.,3-Feb-17,5
"Front desk staff was arrogant, unhelpful and rude. Room value for the price was deplorable. Overpriced and cheap on amenities. Maid didn't make up the room until late afternoon. We have removed Hyatt Hotels from our corporate list of approved hotels.",3-Feb-17,1
"This is a well situated hotel, a few blocks from the main tourist/travel/conference (Moscone). However due to construction, it is also not very quiet and not easy to get to. The rooms are excellent, but foyer area is crowded.",2-Feb-17,5
"We stayed for 4 nights with my family. Room was a disaster and i had to rent the second room since we were 4 and could not fit the room. They forgot to take the laundry once, in the second we reminded reception around 10.00 with the demand of getting the same day. Instead of doing his best, the guy started to teach me that i had to give it at 9.00 to get it back the same day. I reminded him that nobody came to room until 10.00 etc etc. room service never refreshed the sanitary products until being asked (again through reception since they are very difficult to be reached). Reception guy is always trying to teach instead of solving forgetting that i am a diamond member having stayed in many hyatts (and others) worldwide since last 30 years. And so on, and so on. Very snub staff, having no idea about hotel business. They should definitely be sent for orientation to see how other hyatts work, especially in asia.",1-Feb-17,1
"The location is great, not doubt about that. However there was a few issues which bother me.The bathroom didn't have a door!, only a sliding window and without a lock. I was sharing the room with a co-worker and I didn't get privacy I needed. This turned my stay very uncomfortable.They also charged me for On-Demand movies which I didn't watch.I don't recommend this hotel, you may find something better for a lower price. I have already found better places for less money and in more expensive locations.",1-Feb-17,2
"Last stop on our whirlwind honeymoon and we had just arrived from Hong Kong tired and grumpy. But Spencer at reception was able to get us in and out and was so very helpful. He also made us feel welcome and special with amenities he provided us. The lounge on the 32nd floor is great too, the breakfast spread is one of the better ones offered at an executive lounge. The only criticism I have of the property is that the rooms are right on top of each other and the wall are paper thin. We were able to hear our neighbors get up at 430 the next morning, blowdry their hair, and listen to their breakfast plans. Earplugs are a must. I would have given it a 3 star review, but the fact that the staff more than make up for it, I can't. That's what you want to see at a dated property, staff that more than makes up for it.",1-Feb-17,4
"Good on all levels, rooms, amenities, gym, restaurants, location all goodMore in mid town than I would have preferred ( wanted something nearer touristy bit) but then I didn't book it...so fault mine!Would I recommend...? yes for sure - it just depends on what you want location-wise.CL ",1-Feb-17,5
"This hotel met all of our expectations for our family vacation. It was convenient to the BART (three blocks), the cable cars (4 blocks to the turnaround?) and the MUNI (1 block) as well as a few restaurants and lots of shopping. Stay on a high floor if possible. The views are stunning.We also chose to have breakfast and access to the club/lounge on the 32nd floor. This was well worth the price as it also gave us access to a place to cool our heels outside of the room when we weren't running from place to place. They also have snacks, dessert, and an honor bar every night. Worth the $ for sure. Staff was super courteous and check in and out were efficient and easy experiences.",1-Feb-17,5
"The location is awesome. Great for business or pleasure. Lots of shopping and conveniences, including a Starbucks and 24-hr CVS on the adjacent corners. Hotel rooms are modern and upgraded and the lobby was welcoming. The conference center accommodations were also above average. ",31-Jan-17,5
"I give Grand Hyatt Hotel on 345 Stockton Street 5 stars. Wonderful in house dining and room service dining as well. The room was quite, clean, with all amenities and a great view. If anything was needed the items were delivered. The concierge was very helpful with our requests for museums and special points of interest. Our little group decided on the Walt Disney Family Museum at the Presidio by the Golden Gate Bridge very interesting a wonderful site full of history. I will definitely delve into the many options to explore on the next trip. I recommend as a great place to stay in the middle of Union Square a block behind the main entrance on Powell Street we discovered the best little place of Breakfast and also for fine dining; The Sears family restaurant. The Grand Hyatt is the place to stay we will be back.",31-Jan-17,5
"We arrived at the hotel after a 14 night cruise to Hawaii we booked this hotel as part of my wifes 70 th birthday treat, but having read the reviews we were looking forward to the stay, we were given a room on the fifth floor with fantastic views of air vents.Went to breakfast the next morning to be greeted by a very surly lady who struggled to speak to us, we had the hot buffet that was cold and not very good .it cost 52 dollars, the waiter bought the bill back because we hadnt put a tip on it.We went to mcdonalds next door for 12 dollars. We found the room cold as the heating didnt work,an engineer came and took the ceiling panels down to fix it.This hotel was on my wifes bucket list as her maiden name was Hyatt and she wanted to sign her name.So we were disappointed after complaining the hotel cancelled our breakfast bill and offered us points off our next stay in a hyatt hotel. But we will wait and see.",31-Jan-17,3
"Overall all staff in every Dept was very attentive and very nice. Friendly and appear to enjoy to comfort the guest. The grand club was a last minute offer. I just wished I could of controlled myself w the fresh baked good, cakes,etc ",30-Jan-17,5
Needed a place to stay in SF downtown... Grand Hyatt was reasonably priced through trivago.Service was outstanding which you would or should expect. Gave a free room upgrade when asked upon checkin. They stated they provide this upgrade when they are able. So always ask.Room was spacious well appointed especially the convenient and plentiful outlets etc. room had a great view... EtcWill definitely go back with the right deal!,30-Jan-17,5
"The room was clean and attractive. It was decorated in a minimalist style, and offered a relaxing place to unwind. The views from the room were beautiful, overlooking Union Square with looks all the way out to the harbor. Within walking distance to many attractions and to public transportation.",30-Jan-17,5
"Excellent hotel! I was in town for a conference and the Grand Hyatt was one of my first impressions of the city and, it was a GOOD one. My guest room was clean and the staff was super pleasant. The next time I'm in San Francisco I'll definitely being staying at the Grany Hyatt! =)",30-Jan-17,5
"My husband and I travel a fair amount. We struggled with whether to purchase our nights through one of the many boutique hotels available or a familiar name brand like hyatt. I'm glad we chose hyatt. I was very pleased with the overall customer service (reception, concierge). Our room bathroom was very nice. It had a wonderful little vanity that was great for hair and makeup. The view of the city and shopping from the 27th floor was awesome. Sleep quality was great (linens and pillows were perfect). Ask the concierge for food suggestions. They won't lead you astray. Also, the little breakfast they set up in the lobby was great for grab and go items and opens at 5:30. ",29-Jan-17,5
"Solid hotel with very comfortable guest rooms and outstanding customer service. Good central location. Didn't have time to take advantaage of the hotel's other features, but the bed was super comfortable and slept well!",29-Jan-17,5
"Using points we opted for the Club level and the benefits. Rooms are on the top three levels with a very nice Club Room and staff. We enjoyed the views, food in late after noon, honor bar, evening desserts and breakfast bar. Room was excellent, rather new, well appointed and maintained. Easy parking across street. ",28-Jan-17,5
"If you are in SFO for a limited time, I definitely recommend staying by Union Square. It is centrally located and walking distance to most tourist sites. The Hotel is right by Union Square, which is a very busy area, high end restaurants and shops. Request for a room on the higher level which are recently upgraded and have a good city/bay view too.",27-Jan-17,4
"I've always loved this hotel! The design and the feeling they give really gets me exited about travel! :D so after years of visiting this hotel and dreaming of staying one day, I Finally did! :D its a very clean hotel, and of course the design is very inspiring and wonderful! I gotta say, if you are a tourist and you traveled long and far to come to this wonderful city of San Francisco, Grand Hyatt SF is one of the best to stay! And a great place just to sit back and relax! (And everything else is taken care for you :) )",26-Jan-17,5
"Having stayed at the hotel for 8 nights with the family 2 children aged 11 and 8, Iâ€™ll be honest I wasnâ€™t that impressed.Firstly the day we checked in at around 3.30 my wife asked if there was a chance of an upgrade as we were staying for 8 nights and we were told the hotel was fully booked and no rooms available except one other with a rubbish view. Then as we went to our room, the previous guest was in there and had locked it only to use the bathroom. Again, annoying as staff should have blocked his key card from 12pm, the room was made up so clearly he had access all day. Until security checked it we stayed in the room. The room is average for 4 people with not a lot of space for luggage etc. We were however left some fruit and cupcakes when we got back from dinner which Iâ€™m assuming was due to the invasion of our room by the previous guest. The hotel lobby area was decorated beautifully.Considering we checked in on 26th December, I would have thought the hotel would have been in the Christmas spirit and offered guests staying for a long period some sort of gift or something little for the children, but nothing. The hotel was busy for the first few days of our stay due to the local football team staying there, but after a few days Iâ€™m sure many rooms were available and with the amount we paid a real shame we werenâ€™t offered a better room on a higher floor With so many other hotels in SF I would not recommend this one. To be honest having stayed with the Hyatt group in the past, Iâ€™m not sure I will be rushing back to a Hyatt hotel.In terms of cleanliness, the rooms were made up every day, but there was never any dusting done, it was just beds made and clean towels.Biggest plus is location to Union square.",26-Jan-17,3
The hotel is situated beautifully in the City and is close to everything. The room was very well appointed and the bed was amazingly plush and comfortable. My only complaint was not enough lighting over the desk,25-Jan-17,5
had a great time. We went to SF on a whim to go shopping teenage daughter and mom. Hotel is in perfect location. We had a nice dinner around the corner and night cap for mom at one up. Highly recommend ,23-Jan-17,5
"Stayed two nights in the Grand Hyatt; outstanding service by the doormen and valet. The valet is expensive, as is parking anywhere in SF - but they really worked hard to take care of my needs. The room is a little small, but very nice. The only problem may have been that it was so called those days, that my bathroom against the outside wall was freezing when I took a shower. The bar on the second floor is full of life, and live music - the bartender was great. I would stay here again on my next business trip - looking forward to it.",23-Jan-17,5
good hotel in great location. The parking is much too expensive. Hotel is clean an is what I expected I do not want to write any more information This is the reason that I don't review more with trip advisor,23-Jan-17,5
"Room service very expensive! Hotel parking overnight, very expensive! No coffee pots in the room which forced us to order room service which was outrageous. No pricing on the menu so was very surprised!",23-Jan-17,3
"Checked into the Grand Hyatt for the first time ever. I have been to SF many times but have never visited this hotel. I had a convention inside the hotel and therefore made the hotel my jumping off point. Great location, amazing staff and the room and the rooms view were amazing! Next time I am back in the city I can see making this hotel my first look.",23-Jan-17,5
"I flew in to san Francisco and stayed at the Hyatt in Union Square. Epic stay. Classy, upscale, and very professional. The one up restaraunt and lounge was awesome. The grandinner club was very handy for a quick breakfast before sight seeing. View was spectacular. Awesome stay ",22-Jan-17,5
We recently had a critical corporate meeting planned at Grand Hyatt San Francisco. We had over 175 attendees staying over 5 days. Hyatt team did a perfect job. Their meeting planning team (Particularly Regina Drake) is the best I have ever met.,21-Jan-17,5
"The room itself was great...well the second one was. The first one the heater was broken and made very loud noises. Clean and comfortable...Lucas at the One Up restaurant they have onsite...fantastic. Simply above and beyond in service. As for the front desk? They authorized my card for over $3000 for a $1000 stay. When asked why that was, they offered no explanation. Just said it was a glitch and ""shouldn't have happened."" No apology, no compensation. They tied up $3000 of my money, and nothing. I understand that these things can happen, but seriously? No apology or any sort of compensation? After I checked out, another $500 was authorized to my card. What? The charges are still pending. I am assured they will all fall off....but in the mean time, $3500 of my money is on hold. Be VERY careful of this. I have NEVER had this happen to me before and I travel ALL the time. Did I mention my money is still pending? I even spoke to the manager, who eventually apologized....but that's about it. ",20-Jan-17,3
"Stayed 2 nights and this hotel is in a great location, to get out and about in San Francisco. It is within easy reach of Union Square, with great shopping, dining, Chinatown and the Wharf. The rooms are spacious and very comfy and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Wish we had stayed longer as SF is a great place for site seeing and when I return I will have no hesitation to stay at this hotel again.",20-Jan-17,5
Rooms are on the smaller size but clean. Everyone nice and helpful. Breakfast buffet was really tasty and good value if you don't want to leave hotel. It rained during our trip and doormen gave us an umbrella before we headed out. CVS right across the street. Easy to get around Union square and Chinatown. Concierge helped with directions to Oakland using BART so we missed traffic and was in time for Warriors game. Definitely will return. ,19-Jan-17,5
Went for an overnight trip with my mother and daughter. The hotel was clean and in a fantastic location. Across the street from Union Square in San Francisco and all of the stores are within walking distance. Upon arrival the staff was very friendly and gracious.,19-Jan-17,5
"Most horrible staff attitude ever and severe lack amenities. Despite ordering before check-in, basic amenities like toothbrush and slippers are not provided. When request from staff, they were unwilling to provided and impatient to finish listening to the list of items. In the end, not all were provided. Water has to be requested. There isn't any water provided in rooms. Well, unless you are in the best suites?Information provided by the concierge on tours was also wrong. However, if you just want a nice bed to crash and convenient location, go ahead and stay here.",17-Jan-17,1
"The Grand Hyatt SF is in a great location just off Union Square. The rooms are modern and spacious. Views are outstanding, especially upper floors facing the Square and the Bay. The Mezzanine Bar was cozy. Service was excellent starting with Anthony at the reception/check in area. The only drawback is the cost for valet. Over $150 for 2 nights, but I guess that is SF. We would definitely stay here again. ",17-Jan-17,4
"If you're going to SFO for a few days of applied tourism, you'll know there's a bewildering number of accommodation options. Rather than go for the low-rise eclectic options down near wharves, we opted for the Grand Hilton near Union Square.This is a nice hotel, as you would expect. The distinguishing features I would mention are a take-away coffee and breakfast bar in the lobby (quicker and cheaper than the breakfast buffet), and housekeeping staff which we found to be very attentive and thoughtful.Location is great. $7 Uber ride (when no traffic) from the wharf district, and one block from Union Square and all the retail activity.There's certainly plenty of homeless around Union Square, but we generally didn't find them aggressive.From the 27th floor we could hear muted traffic noise, but certainly not enough to cause any sleep problems. Great view of the bay disappearing and reappearing through the fog.",17-Jan-17,5
Grand Hyatt at Union Square is always a good hotel in San Francisco with its modern spacious rooms. I have stayed here with family also and it's ideally located for both business and family travellers. The OneUp restro - coffee shop is very versatile with its menu. Pro Tip - Request a room with Coit Tower View,17-Jan-17,5
"Stayed here for business.The hotel is located in the city and very close to big outlets like Macy's and other shopping venues. Malls and restaurants are within walking distance.The hotel is spacious and feels old school with doormen flagging taxis. Loved it,The rooms are well appointed if a little drab. Comfortable enough though with great views.Breakfasts are great with menu and buffet options. They serve the best bacon ever!Room service was good and prompt. I really recommend their pizzas, i was pleasantly surprised.Right next to the Apple store and i think this is a great hotel for both business and vacation!Highly recommended",16-Jan-17,4
"This property is centrally located in the heart of SF. It is great location to take day trips to see all the SF area has to offer. This is especially true over the holidays. it provides great access to public transportation and cable cars, and it is short walk to Chinatown and many other SF treats.",13-Jan-17,4
"The Hyatt San Francisco is a typical Hyatt hotel (overpriced for the value). The rooms were standard- nice and kept pretty clean. The location is clutch- right in the middle of union square. However, the check-in process was LONG. First in line, I waited for about 15-20 minutes before anyone even asked if I was being helped. There was one person doing the check-in and the line behind me started building up. After a long flight across the country and a taxi cab from the airport I was finally at the hotel and all I wanted to do was get to my room and relax. On top of that, didnâ€™t seem like any of the staffers really cared about the line either. Other than the poor check-in service, no real complaints (or praises). Overall, it isnâ€™t a bad choice but I think there are equally nice much less expensive hotels in the area that I would suggest going for.",12-Jan-17,3
"Again the SF Grand Hyatt proves its one of my favorite hotels. Recently had to be in The City for a dinner and did not want to travel back home afterwards. Hotel was decorated for Christmas - looked fantastic. Loyalty works both ways and thats why I have stayed with Hyatt so long. As a life time diamond member - I am always treated nicely but not all the staff knows your status. How you are treated by those that don't know is important - and I can say that the staff is great! From the moment you drive up to departure. I would encourage folks to consider the SF Grand Hyatt if you have not stayed there before. Great location, great rooms and great service.",11-Jan-17,5
"Hotel is in a good spot for shopping and catching trams (trolleys) right by Union Square (behind Apple store) however it is not cheap and it is very impersonal. Aside from check in and out i did not have a single staff member speak to or acknowledge me in 5 days. The 'doormen' dont even open the doors or help with your bags. The bar is small and usually busy. Rooms are a good size and beds comfy enough. The soundproofing is not good enough if u have a room with interconnecting door, we did with a young family next door. Had to listen to crying and screaming from kids every night and cartoons on their TV the rest of the time. ",11-Jan-17,3
Stayed here for the first time and it was nice. The roooms are clean and the staff was nice. Vanessa at the concierge desk was very helpful with suggestions on where to dine and what to do. Our first night there she suggested Fino for dinner which is an Italian place next to the saint andrews hotel. It is within walking distance and had amazing Italian food. I would definitely stay here again. ,10-Jan-17,5
"We arrived at this hotel after a long day travelling. The doorman took our bags from the taxi driver and pushed them into the foyer, no offer to take them to our rooms. We were a family of four, ( 2 adult children) requiring a king room and a twin. We booked and paid months in advance. We were told no twin rooms were available, we would get two kings. They offered a rollaway bed! I argued that my 25 year old son would not be sleeping in a rollaway, no success, they didn't care less. We discovered that the hotel was full of college footballers who of course had all the twin rooms, who cares about tourists who promote your city or hotel! It went on, trying to get a drink or some food, a nightmare, 1 and a half hour wait for room service, only option was to go to the bar and eat whatever was available there. Sat down, ignored by staff, bar man too busy talking to another couple to bother with us, finally grabbed a waitress and ordered food. Next day went back to front desk to try to change rooms, after much arguing and a call to our travel agent, managed to get a twin room and an apology in the form of a bottle of wine and cheese platter. But too late to change our mind, every staff member in that hotel was rude, we saw doormen push in front of guests to get in the lifts first, and another bash suitcases against the wall to get into the lift. The only person who showed any friendliness was the doorman as we left, perhaps glad that another tourist was leaving? Only good thing about this hotel......the bottle of lovely Californian wine.",10-Jan-17,2
"We stayed at the hotel for a romantic weekend in Union Square, SF. The location is perfectly situated for all sorts of activities. Upon arrival, we were met with very professional and courteous front desk staff. The room was very fresh and contemporary with a great view. Can't wait to go back and stay longer!",10-Jan-17,5
"Modern updated rooms. Convenient to Union Square shopping and restaurants. Friendly staff at the front door and at Check-In. Have stayed at Hyatt Union Square many times, always a pleasant experience.",10-Jan-17,5
In the heart of San Francisco within walking distance of shopping and eating. Lobby has three charming living room with fireplaces; especially nice since it was raining all weekend. Suggest staying in the upper rooms to take advantage of the fabulous views.,9-Jan-17,5
We loved our New Years stay at the Hyatt. Our room overlooked Union Square which was AMAZING! Christmas trees and ice skating rink. We could hear the buskers from our room which was lovely. We opted to self park at the Sutter/Stockton Garage which is diagonally opposite the hotel. The hotel actually uses this car park for valet. It worked out much cheaper to do it by yourself and not through the hotel. Over the weekend we actually got street parking which was much cheaper on Sat and free on Sunday. There is a McD's at the bottom of the hotel which is good for a cheap breakfast for the kids.,9-Jan-17,5
Stayed for 3 nights. The staff was excellent. This hotel is located close to Union Square and walking distance to great shops restaurants and more. Transportation readily accessible for farther distances. Buffett breakfast was good with a wide variety of foods. Room was comfortable but you could hear street noise which is typical for San Francisco.,9-Jan-17,4
"Nicely located in the downtown SF. Stayed there for four nights. The check-in was quick. The room, bathroom all of that is great and clean. It has a real nice look everywhere. The only thing I didn't like was that there were no quick eating options, especially at odd hours during the day. They have room service but I didn't find much interesting there. There is a Starbucks right across and I ended up going there a lot. That said, there are several restaurants nearby for a take out.There is one odd incidence that I do want to write about. When I checked out, a hotel person at the front door asked me if I wanted a car provided by them and it would cost me the same as a cab. I took that. What they did not tell me was that the car driver had no way to accept credit cards. So I had to run around at SFO to find an ATM. The driver was a nice guy and there was no issue with the cab service but this was an annoying experience.",8-Jan-17,4
"Room was very nice, staff very accommodating. Restaurant and bar was a little small but food was excellent. Walking distance to Union Square and fine dining. Lots of shopping and sight seeing within walking distance.",8-Jan-17,5
"I stayed here for a few nights around new year with family and friends.The location is perfect, right in the middle of all the tourist action. The hotel is well maintained and in good order (better than the Westin St Francis, where I previously stayed). The rooms are small but very comfortable.What sets this place apart is the hotel staff. They are extremely helpful and responsive, and will do their best to keep you happy. The free wifi is a bit of a nuisance, dropping out often and having to log in again. But it's quite fast enough for most needs .The food in the restaurant is of high quality. There is also a nice bar on the mezzanine, with bar snacks and sometimes live music. Lovely.I will definitely be going back.",8-Jan-17,4
"We just came back from staying at the Grand Hyatt for 4 nights over New Year's. It was the end of our family's trip up the coast of CA. We had been to SF before but had not stayed here. It was a great stay. Beautiful views of Union Square from our rooms on the 29th floor. Spacious rooms, comfortable beds, plenty of space for our stuff. Only small complaint would be the loud screeching noise the toilet made when flushed! Oh and one thing the Hyatt should mention to its guests when they are in the city on a Tuesday at Noon: there is a loud emergency signal (sounds like an air raid) they blast in the City as an emergency test. Freaked us out! Sounded like we were being invaded! I called to the front desk and all she said was it was something outside the hotel. This should really be explained in advance to guests. Other than that, a wonderful stay at this hotel, would definitely come back!",7-Jan-17,5
"We had a enjoyable stay (for 11 nights) in Grand Hyatt Union Square. Our flight touched down at 8pm and we reached the hotel around 10pm. Having flown half a globe (18 hrs flight), we were really tired. Fortunately, the check-in was very efficient. It took us less than 5 mins. The check in staff was courteous and friendly.The hotel is located right smack in Union Square, and it's an easy walk to the Ferry Building, China Town and the Financial district. There are lots of food options around. Pharmacy (CVS) and Walgreen are just steps away. There are plenty of shopping places (incl. Macy's, Bloomingdale, Nordstorm etc.), plenty of luxury brands too.Our room was spacious, clean and bright. I love the king size bed, it is one of the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on. There are sufficient pillows and power socket in the room, and the complimentary wifi worked well. There was also a coffee machine in the room, which coffee drinkers will definitely appreciate. However, there was no kettle provided.The housekeeping staffs have done a good job. Our room was cleaned everyday by noon.We ordered in-room dining once. The food tasted extremely good. Do note that room service is subjected to a whopping 22% service charge on top of the prevailing government tax and delivery charge. There are some minor issues which I wish could be improved upon:1) The absence of many basic amenities (which are commonly provided by hotels) such as comb, tooth paste and tooth brush, shower cap, kettle etc. You need to call to get them sent to you. 2) The hair dryer was noisy and weak. I think it should be upgraded to better ones. 3) The drawer of our bedside table (both sides) were very hard to pull out. The side tables are also very shaky. 4) Everyday we need to request for bottled water from the reception. Why not get the housekeeping to replenish the bottled water (like many other hotels do)?Overall, Grand Hyatt Union Square is a good hotel. I will stay here again.",7-Jan-17,4
Currently staying at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. A very impressive hotel in a fantastic location. A fantastic room overlooking Macy's in union square. The hotel is very well presented and extremely clean. Great architecture and design that is very pleasing on the eye. All staff are very helpful and the food available for breakfast is top notch. A great gym is available 24/7 on the 35th floor giving fantastic views. Treat yourself to a great hotel.,5-Jan-17,5
"This is an overdue review. We stayed Club Level and had a room with hardwood floors. If you greatly dislike dingy hotel carpet, you will really appreciate this! The views are awesome and the rooms are very nice and spacious. It is a very solid SF hotel in a good location. There was a small amount of city noise and wind noise from the windows. Again, not a deal breaker but also not as soundproofed as other properties. Did not bother my husband at all, but it may bother an extremely light sleeper. ",5-Jan-17,4
"Good location and very good quality rooms. Not as upscale as you would think. Nothing really negative to say except we had a drain issue in our room and our friends had a A/C issue in theres. Our issue was fixed quickly but our friends issues wasn't. They were comp'd a bit to make up for it. We've stayed at other hotels in the area and will move on to other ones next year. Not a bad experience, its just that we've had better at other locations. Our kids preferred the smaller rooms we've had in the past in exchange for ambiance and extras.",5-Jan-17,3
"Enjoyed a few nights at this hotel the week before Thanksgiving. I am so glad I upgraded my room to a Bay View as when the fog clears in the morning there is a gorgeous view that you can enjoy on the comfy sofa, by the floor to ceiling window! Not to forget the remote controlled window blind that you can open from your bed!This hotel is very modern and trendy and it's in a great location in SF! You are literally steps away from Union Square and opposite a huge shopping mall. The service at the hotel was very good, and all of the hotel staff were very friendly, from the front desk and concierge to the evening restaurant and I would definitely stay here again because of the location. I have already recommended this hotel to friends and colleagues who are travelling to SF in 2017.",5-Jan-17,5
"Incredible location, and terrific service all across the board. People were very helpful and friendly. Right next to Union Square, with great shopping, dining and the trolley experience if you want that. Very easy to get down to the Wharf, where you can use as a base for SF tours, etc. Also went to GS Warrriors game and quick trip home, and before that did coastal tour, Stanford and Silicon Valley.",4-Jan-17,5
"We have a daughter who lives near Napa. So we fly in and out of Oakland frequently throughout the year. The flight form Hawaii lands in Oakland late at night. We stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to visiting our daughter. I noted that you may make arrangements, for a fee, to have the town car pick you us. So, that was what we did. Concierge Liz Baca helped us. She was the bomb!!! Our driver met us at the baggage claim and it was a grand stay from that point on. We are gold passport members and always try to utilize the club floors. This hotel is located right on Union Square, next to the Apple store. Great for SF shopping and dining. Room was recently renovated. And Liz Baca helped us so much. We also had the town car return us to Oakland airport and we picked up our rental car and went on our Napa journey. BTW, the cost for parking at this hotel runs about $75 per day. So that is why we opted for town car pick-up and drop off. We taxied the rest of the stay. We hope the hotel manager will acknowledge Liz Baca. She is very friendly, efficient and has great follow- through. She really made our stay over the top.",4-Jan-17,4
"I have long been coming to the Grand Hyatt San Francisco in Union Square. There is probably not a better and more central location in the City. While the move towards a more modern hotel in recent years does the property a disservice, the staff more than makes up for this lowering of physical quality. Most of the staff has been there a long time and they are perhaps the most customer centric group you could ever find in a major hotel chain property. Every request is met with a 'can do' attitude and get's done. From an early check in to a last minute request for a king room on a high floor - no problem. Great insulation from outside sounds, good beds and large bathrooms all are positive features of this hotel. The Club Lounge is large and active and services an excellent variety of food and drink. Beer and wine for $3.00, cocktails for $4.00, all come with a wonderful 32nd floor view of the entire City. The restaurant is good and service great. The only downside, from my point of view, is that they have taken away the ambiance of the property, from the larger rooms with beautiful art to the modern lobby that has lost its marble (literally). They have made more rooms with connecting doors which increases internal noise and replaced carpet with wooden floors which also increases internal noise. Helpful security will quiet down loud neighbors, but the noise from floors above can be a problem. Overall, one of the best hotels in San Francisco!",4-Jan-17,5
"Love the location- by union square (lots of shopping, skating rink ( for the holidays) ) , the atrium was interesting, nicely updated rooms. We were upgraded to a suite and it had such a lovely view! Just perfect for our little getaway !",4-Jan-17,4
"This is an excellent hotel. I have stayed here at least 10 times in the last few years and I only stay here. No complaints whatsoever. Hotel property is excellent, staff is friendly. If you are in San Francisco and want an excellent place to stay, the Grand Hyatt is that place. The Grand Club is a great choice of room if you want the best of the best.",3-Jan-17,5
"Excellent service; excellent location for exploring SAn Francisco (Union square, Moma, wharves, etc. within walking). I checked in early and they found me a room as well as fulfilled some ""pre-trip"" requests of flowers in the room. ",3-Jan-17,5
My only complaint was the sleep quality. I found the bed horrible uncomfortable. To the point I woke up every morning in pain. The hotel was gorgeous. The staff was wonderful. Every member was friendly and extremely helpful. ,3-Jan-17,4
The Grand Hyatt was an excellent hotel. Room was clean and service was perfect. The location was perfect for getting around to all the hot spots in the city. I would stay there again for sure and would recommend it to my friends.,2-Jan-17,5
"Stayed here in November 2016 for business.I arrived at the hotel around mid-day and was checked in quickly by a very friendly associate.The room was on a high floor and had a good view north, towards the Transamerica Pyramid and 555 California. The hotel looks like it has been renovated, as the rooms were much nicer, lighter and well appointed than I remember from an earlier visit. The bed was comfy with nice pillows...I slept well, despite the jet lag. There were also a lot of power plug points, which is always helpful. The bathroom was also new-ish and worked fine. I spoke to the check in person about the hotel looking refurbished but she didn't know...maybe it was a few years back.The main positive of the hotel is obviously the location on Union Square, however towards the quieter side. I was able to walk to all my meetings in SOMA and also the Financial District. For tourists, the Embarcadero and China Town are also nearby. I chatted with the concierge about some dinner reservations and also help with some other chores and she was very helpful. The doormen and the bell staff were also very courteous and helpful.I did not eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on that. Overall, I enjoyed my stay here. I would visit again.",2-Jan-17,4

"Stayed here for two nights on holidays. The location really can't be beat, and views from the room were unreal! Everything is walking distance. Free upgrade to a club room as they recognized Diamond status. Would stay here again.",1-Jan-17,5
What a beautiful hotel. Loved the lobby area as well as the guest room. The views on the top floors are beautiful. The restaurant is very good. There is nothing negative one can think of about this hotel - the staff is terrific. They make you feel you have come home to family. I would stay there in a heart beat.,1-Jan-17,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco offered me an exceptional vacation experience. Staying on the 26th floor, I had incredible views of the city. The staff was accommodating, polite and respectful of my wishes. I highly recommend the Grand Club Room/Restaurant. The hotel is located just steps from incredible shopping and restaurants. No need for a cab if you're shopping downtown.",31-Dec-16,5
"We enjoyed our stay during the Foster Farms bowl game week. Everyone was very helpful and friendly, rooms were comfortable, parking, though expensive, was convenient for coming and going, and there are many choices for eating and shopping close by.",31-Dec-16,4
"The Grand Hyatt is in an excellent location, really close for shopping, lots to see and do around the area. We had an excellent room, which was large and had good storage. Beds were lovely and really really comfortable. Loved the block-out blinds. Wonderful view over Union Square with the ice skating rink and Christmas tree. Great staff who were very attentive. Great breakfast selection in the restaurant and with good service.",31-Dec-16,5
"Look it isn't the newest hotel, but it has a lot going for it. First and foremost, the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Next location is easy walking distance to a lot of sights or a cable car. Rooms comfortable and roomy.",30-Dec-16,4
Picked this hotel for a birthday weekend for my son. Great location. Great jump off for shopping. Ice skating in Union Square right around the corner. Cable car station down the street. Nice clean rooms . Great helpful staff. ,30-Dec-16,4
"Good hotel and great location. A couple of annoying items. First is the parking is outrageous, $45 for self park and $67 for valet. I realize this is San Francisco, but the public garage across the street is $18. If you have to park recommend the Sutter street garage. Also the bar situation could be improved. They closed the great bar on the top of the hotel, very disappointing. The new bar is ok, live music is a nice touch but they were trying to shut it down at 11:30 on a Thursday night with 20 people in there. They kept making the lights brighter which was silly. Seems like if there are paying customers I'm the bar they should leave it open.",29-Dec-16,4
"In line with the quality of the Grand Hyatt line in this hotel chain, it is clean, new, and comfortable. Comfortable and warm seating area in the lobby. Rooms are clean and no-nonsense. Hyatt club lounge has spectacular views of the city. Nice place to hang out and rest. It gets crowded quickly during breakfast, so getting a table may be a challenge. Convenient location off of Union Square. Lots of foot traffic in the lobby area.",29-Dec-16,4
The hotel was nice. The restaurant and bar employees were inattentive to the point of rudeness. The employees in those areas are working directly against the efforts of the chain to improve customer relations.,29-Dec-16,4
"Efficient check in after a long 20 hr flight. Location made it easy to access shopping, cable car, buses and Union Square amenities. It is surrounded by a number of different restaurants which cater for a range of tastes. We felt very safe in this area but I wouldn't walk too far in the wrong direction. The room was very clean and updated. It had a very noisy air conditioner and once reported was immediately fixed. As we were out, the maintenance person left a note notifying us and also a cute tin of mints.(nice touch) There is a 'Grab n Go' section on the ground floor that had a great range of options for breakfast which is handy for 6pm tour pick ups. Visited the restaurant for dinner and the service and food was very good.",28-Dec-16,4
Went to this hotel with great expectation after staying in the Gran Hyatt in Jakarta. Was terrible. Noise insulation between floors and between rooms was appalling. Wifi didn't work and when it did it was slow. It took 2 days to connect our devices. The lifts took up 15 minutes to arrive at your floor. I travel a lot and this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in a long time. On the up side the location is good and most of the staff are great.,27-Dec-16,1
Great views of the city and bay from our room! Excellent bed and bedding! We had a comfortable and enjoyable stay!! Next time we'll spring for the club level like our friends did. The breakfast there looked awesome! ,27-Dec-16,5
"I'm generally a big fan of Grand Hyatt hotels--you can usually assume the rooms will be comfortably well-appointed and top tier. We checked in yesterday to the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, and I can already say my husband and I are very disappointed. The room lacks a basic dresser to hold our clothes--we are left to try and fit a week's worth of clothing in our two nightstands with very shallow drawers and a few drawers in the closet that are also about the depth you need for socks, not clothing. So we are left to leave our clothes in our suitcases. Again, not what I would expect at a Grand Hyatt. Secondly, we've only been here two days and the elevators have been severely delayed. There was some kind of mishap last night were the elevators were either not working at all or were extremely delayed so we had to take the fire stairs down to not miss our dinner reservation. The bathroom is tight and tiny--there are two tiny hooks for bath towels and that is it. I'm honestly shocked that this hotel has such great reviews on Trip Advisor--the hotel is fine, but it's not at the level of a typical Grand Hyatt. I would not stay here again.",27-Dec-16,2
We have been staying in Grand Hyatt SF for many years and have never been disappointed. This is by far the best place to stay in Union square. Staff is super friendly and caring. I usually don't eat in the hotel restaurants as there are so many other choices in SF. I will highly recommend Grand Hyatt.,27-Dec-16,5
Situated right next to Union square .. great service and attention to detail .. we had a room on the 30th floor .. food was great and the happy hour was a great opportunity to meet and greet .. recommended ,27-Dec-16,4
we went for the Oakland vs. Colts game and we're from Indianapolis. Yet Raiders fans. Being in San Francisco wearing Raiders gear I thought we might get harassed a bit even if just in good humor. Well that didnt happen. Everyone was very cordial.,26-Dec-16,5
"This is a good Grand Hyatt conveniently located in Union Square in the heart of the city by the bay. The hotel is nice, contemporary and well designed. It's been recently renovated and the rooms are modern and clean. I had a jr suite with incredible views of downtown San Francisco and the Transamerica building. It's not cheap, but you get a lot for the money. The service is good though the check-in process seems a little too casual. Service is efficient and pleasant but not what I would consider five star. The coffee makers need an upgrade. Water pressure in bathrooms is not good though I imagine they are trying to save water. I definitely can recommend this hotel, just don't anticipate a five star experience.",26-Dec-16,4
Great value for perfect location. Lovely hotel and attentive staff. Workout room was a bonus. We look forward to making this an annual trip. Thanks to the entire staff for a lovely home away from home. ,25-Dec-16,5
"This was one of the nicest and most luxurious for the money of any hotels I've stayed in during the past tens years. Not only was my room beautifully appointed with elegant, simple modern design, but the bed linens were so soft and comfortable, I was tempted to just stay in bed all day. The mattress was perfect, too, worthy of Goldilocks. The room was light and airy in daylight and extremely well lighted at night, thanks to well placed (and attractive) lamps that illuminated all areas in a way that that is rare for hotel rooms. It's a room where one could actually see to read while sitting in a comfortable chair! Everything was well appointed, including the vanity area and the spacious bathroom. I was impressed when the coffee tray I ordered arrived exactly at the requested time and even the coffee cup was beautifully designed. Based on this experience, I will never stay anywhere else in San Francisco. ",25-Dec-16,5
Stayed here on the 23rd of Christmas just so we could spend the day in the city on Christmas eve.Pros: 1. The hotel is in a very convenient location. CVS pharmacy across the street. 1 block from union square. Tons of shopping and restaurants.2. The rooms were a good size. Everything was modern and clean. Bed was fairly comfortable.3. OneUp bar and restaurant was hip and trendy. Decent food and drinks.4. Service was friendly and free WiFi is always a good thing.Cons:1. We stayed on the 14th floor and we could hear everything on the street. I requested to not face the major streets (which they accommodated) yet there was still quite a bit of noise at night.2. Parking was horrendous. $60 for valet (in/out). $45 for self park (in/out - 1/2 block away). Wish we knew better and parked at union square (which is around $30 a night (no in/outs). And we also found out that the parking lot for the Grand Hyatt self park would have been $10 cheaper if we didn't tell them we were actually staying at the Grand Hyatt. :/3. The a/c was temperamental which unfortunately caused me some sleep.4. And i know this might not matter to most people but I felt like this hotel lacked some christmas spirit in its decorations. I wanted to go to a place where everything was lit and really christmasy. This has the bare minimum.Overall a decent option if you are carless and don't care much about the noise at night.,25-Dec-16,3
"The gracious and helpful staff at the Grand Hyatt created a warm atmosphere and a classic, boutique-hotel feel. We were greeted with smiles from check-in thru departure and at every point in between. The hotel was immaculately maintained. It also needs to be high-lighted that the Grand is in a perfect location to take in the shopping, dining, sight-seeing and entertainment that SF has to offer. We will be back!",25-Dec-16,5
"The staff were friendly and helpful. I was able to check in early before my meeting and the quality of the from was great. Everything was nice and clean. The location was perfect. Able to walk to the waterfront, ice skate in Union square and walk to the state building for my meeting! Loved being able to get out and move after a long flight.",24-Dec-16,5
 Got dust is everywhere I was coughing all four days. the next-door was very loud and I have complained multiple times and nothing happened. And I complained they told me that they have to follow the procedure and first was to send security and then a manager. but nothing really happened,24-Dec-16,3
"The moment we arrived at the hotel, we had an altercation with the valet. The check-in was not a traditional check in area. It felt like an airport. The main lobby was confusing. The room was small and I didn't like that the bathroom had a sliding glass door instead of a real door. The location was great. ",24-Dec-16,3
"Stayed for 4 nights in a suite. Great value just before the holidays. Nice suite with good size rooms. Great views over the city from the 29th floor. Efficient reception staff and helpful concierge. Great location near Union Square, good base for exploring SF.",24-Dec-16,4
"One of the best hotels I have ever visited. The service is excellent, the rooms are spotless, and the location is perfect. I go there once a year, and I have never been disappointed. Try this: Call room service to ask for anything--toothpaste, water, etc.--you'll see that it takes less than five minutes to get it delivered to your room. :-)",24-Dec-16,5
"This 950 sq. ft. suite was outstanding. This was a special occasion and we enjoyed it very much. GREAT VIEWS FROM THE 30TH FLOOR. The food in the Grand Club Lounge and the service was excellent. Special thanks to Corinna Wenks, Director of Rooms.",23-Dec-16,5
"Second stay here. This time with family ! Everything was great but the wifi did not work which was a huge let down given that kids wanted to watch a movie in the evening. Upon complaining we were told that tech support would get back but never did.Five stars for everything else - room service, breakfast, housekeeping, room quality and overall service !",23-Dec-16,4
This is our family tradition. We have been doing it for the last six years. The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco is the perfect location. Service was very good and the staff was very friendly and courteous. We had a great view of the city from our room.,22-Dec-16,5
"As locals in the area, we decided to camp at the Grand Hyatt to avoid a drive back to the valley after a Valentine's dinner date. It's a good hotel, clean, professional and has great drinks. It's a typical high end hotel in the USA and while its good, it's nothing compared to the hotels in Asia. I'd recommend staying here if you're on work or just want a night or two to experience the city over a weekend. Location is great and very central to Union Square so access to bars, restaurants and other food related stuff in SF is very easy.",21-Dec-16,4
"Pros: great central location in Union Square. Excellent staff: courteous, professional from housekeeping to receptionists. Very nice rooms. Cons: Grand Club food quality could be better. Hallway noise too audible through doors. Would go back but not worth paying for Grand Club privileges since better food for breakfast & snacks can be found. However, it was convenient to slip in & out for coffee, tea, water, etc.",20-Dec-16,4
"A thoroughly disappointing stay. I have stayed at several Grand Hyatt hotels and this one certainly does not befit the ""Grand Hyatt"" branding at all. Room size is small and finishing is ""Ikea"" quality. The safe cabinet door was almost falling apart. Bathroom shower knob to switch from overhead shower to handheld did not function. Hot water in the bath was intermittent - sometimes it was way hot and then way cold. Carpet looks worn and wallpaper was peeling. Rooms need better sound proofing - i could hear the lifts wheezing by the whole night.Hotel lobby and reception looks like a budget hotel. The breakfast buffet spread was average only. Service by the staff at the cafe was good and its location is really great - right next to the Union Square with many shopping and restaurant options and centre of activity.The hotel management should seriously look into upgrading the rooms and lobby. I was booked for 5 nights with my family but checked out on the 2nd night.",20-Dec-16,1
"Excellent hotel with lovely ambiance. Perfect location just off Union Square is easy walking distance to restaurants, shops, theatres. Rooms are clean, spacious, modern with a comfortable bed and large bathroom. All staff I encountered were helpful and friendly. The OneUp Restaurant served an excellent breakfast. This was my first stay at this hotel, but I will definitely stay here again. ",19-Dec-16,5
Wireless is terrible. Not enough storage space for one week of clothes in the room. Room safe did not work. No robes unless you ask. Fridge did not cool. Other hotels in the area provide a much better experience. ,19-Dec-16,3
"Check-in was easy; room had all the necessary amenities; never a problem with elevators; great location convenient to shops, restaurants, trolley, etc. Was in town for a conference and the walk to Moscone Center and the BART station on Powell is easy.",19-Dec-16,5
"We enjoy the Grand Hyatt for its location to Union Square and shopping and at Christmas time, the holiday lights and decorations. There is ice skating in the square and easy cable car access. And you must experience Sears Famous Food. Their Swedish pancakes are delicious!",19-Dec-16,5
Had a lovely stay with a nice big comfortable bed. The room is clean with good amenities. The concierge is very helpful in giving direction. The gym is basic but using the lift lobby as a mat work area is a little awkward especially when a large group of people got off when I was working out. Love the convenience of the location where most of the attractions are easily reached by walking.,19-Dec-16,5
"Nice location in the heart of Union Square, walking distance from restaurants and major designer stores. The Grand Hyatt was nice and service was very good. Only negative, we opt to use their mobile key process for check-in, but couldn't get the door open the first time, our Bell person had to open the door for us.",18-Dec-16,4
"For the annual December weekend getaway, my husband and I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt to try something new. I had booked a Union Square view room and we had to wait a bit for it to be ready since we checked in at 10 AM and check in is at 3 PM, but I expected that. We shopped and dined in Union Square but decided to check back at the hotel at 3 PM since we still hadn't received a call saying it was ready. Well, the room was ready but when we walked into it, all we saw was a brick wall. Turns out we'd been put on the 7th floor facing Sutter street which is clearly not Union Square.I was pretty annoyed that I had to go back downstairs with all my luggage to correct this mistake. I worked with another employee at check in who seemed pretty shocked at where we had been placed but from the history my parent's have with staying at this place and having trouble getting the correct room, I wasn't surprised. However, he quickly corrected the error and placed us on the 17th floor with a fantastic view of Union Square and two free drink coupons for OneUp, the restaurant in the hotel. This was perfect because we had dinner reservations there later that night.My husband and I really enjoyed eating at OneUp for breakfast and dinner, the hotel's proximity to Union Square, and the views, but I think we'll try out another hotel next time we're in the city. Aside from the room mix up, it was hard to pull up to the hotel since the street it sits on is very busy. My husband and I also had a hard time getting comfortable in the room with the funky thermostat. It was ice cold when we got in the room even though the temp said 70 and we had to blast it up to 81 to get any warmth. However, forget about sleeping with the heater/air conditioner on unless you can sleep through the loud ticking sound. There were positives and negatives to the place but not enough positives to win me back for next time.",18-Dec-16,4
"Great Experience! Lovely ambiance, Close to what I needed. Staff are great and friendly, and they are also helpful. I think it is one of the best experiences in SFO. The elevators were bit sticky at times but overall experience in the hotel was great. I think the overall rating should be good to very good.",18-Dec-16,4
"We stayed overnight because of business in the early morning. Holidays were in full force and were treated to ice show from our window overlooking union square. Walk to designer shops, Macy's, etc, not to mention the all-important Starbuck's to start the morning with the appropriate dose of caffeine. A nice lounge with good tapas style fair was a plus.",17-Dec-16,5
"Although the location is convenient, the overall experience was a letdown. The hotel decor looked cheap and the staff were a ragtag bunch. The room was clean but had no fan in the bathroom and a lumpy comforter; the beds were not particularly comfortable. Amenities were extremely limited for a hotel in this price range, as was the quality of the furniture and fixtures. The sink, however, was a good size. The nicest aspect was the workout room.",15-Dec-16,3
"This is a nice hotel in a great location, I'm not sure how they got the label of the Grand Hyatt. I was under the impression that Hyatt saved those for some of their top level properties. This was more like a very nice Hyatt Regency with cheap bed sheets from an old Holiday Inn or something. Also if you're planning on going as an elite Hyatt member don't expect much, the club room is filled at all time with anyone and everyone with an email address. The food is pretty good however if you are up for fighting the crowds.",15-Dec-16,3
"The Grand Hyatt is an excellent place to stay in San Francisco Excellent Hotel, Great Staff and nice rooms. The Grand Hyatt is close to Union Square were you have great shopping. Close to Cable Car stops, which you have to do if visiting San Francisco. Additional it is close to many great restaurants.",15-Dec-16,5
This was the worst ever. We shall never again visit Grand Hyatt This wa supposed to be the best ever for my daughter and myself prior to her wedding. I requested a special surprise;it did not happen. I was so upset.,14-Dec-16,1
"I take my family to two or three giants games, to do xmas shopping and usually one other SF trip each year and we always stay at the Grand Hyatt. The rooms are super clean, spacious and modern. All sides have a great view of either Union Square the Bay or the City. The best part is the location. North Beach Italian or China Town for lunch and then out on the town for dinner in the Union Square area. One tip, parking at the public garage across the",14-Dec-16,5
"This was our second stay at this hotel. Basically, we liked this hotel a lot. As many people said its location is fantastic and the staff are friendly. However, a few things could be improved: 1) the available WIFI in our room (@Hyatt_wifi) was unacceptably slow; 2) the capacity of OneUp Restaurant is just too small for the hotel of this size; consequently, we had to wait for our breakfast; 3) some room furniture was not well maintained; e.g., the surface of the backless sofa in front of the closet was not clean, and couldn't wipe out some spots; the closet door was too tight to open/close easily, etc.I hope that at least 1) and 3) will be fixed soon so that we can come back again with greater comfort. Thanks!",14-Dec-16,4
"This hotel is located perfectly just off Union Square. Within walking distance to Golden Gate Theater, Shopping, and the Ferry Building. View was of Coit Tower with Alcatraz obstructed. The best part of the stay was the 32nd floor Lounge. The staff was amazing and the food quite good. Different choices all day.",14-Dec-16,4
"Great location near Union Square, friendly and efficient staff, fun atmosphere, lively and good restaurant, clean spacious rooms - I couldn't have had a better stay! I travel to SAN Francisco often and never stayed at the Grand Hyatt thinking a big hotel would be impersonal but boy was I wrong. I will definitely be back!! Thanks for a great and restful stay!",11-Dec-16,5
"The location is very good, near the Union Square retail area and entertainment. Room was clean and staff helpful. The Grand Club with its daily breakfast and evening snacks was a great optional feature. The only downside was the internet connection which was VERY slow. Difficult to get any work done online.",11-Dec-16,4
We stayed overnight and had a great stay. Perfect location right next to Union Square and all of the shops. Easy walk to Chinatown. Hotel was clean and staff was very friendly. Bed was very comfortable and I had a great night's sleep. We will return.,11-Dec-16,5
Pros- union square location. No carpet in rooms makes for a cleaner room. Housekeeping was very good.Cons- gym is marginally acceptable. Enough aerobic machines but stretching area is in the elevator area and there are not enough weight machines.They also have an amazing view from the 36th floor but the lounge is in the 2nd floor- too bad they don't switch that.,9-Dec-16,4
"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt a number of times over the past 20 years (it is one of the two or three convention hotels I tend to stay at when my meetings are in SF). The staff is always incredibly helpful and friendly.The hotel went through a thorough renovation about 3-4 years ago, and although the lobby is not my particular style (one of those styles that tries to merge modern with cozy) it is pretty relaxing and the fireplaces look nice. I am not a big fan of the looks of the open style of registration area (various computer stations placed around open pods, with computer cords everywhere) but if it works for them I have no problem.The rooms also are very nice with electric shades that can be controlled from the main door area or from the bedside. Also, individual gooseneck reading lights by the bed are a nice touch as are very accessible electric plugs both by the bedside and by the desk. The TVs are all nice flat screens with connections via HDMA and video for business people wanting to check out their presentations. And one touch I really appreciate (found less and less in the ""upscale"" hotels) is the in-room refrigerator rather than a in-room bar fridge. There are so many wonderful places to eat in SF, and it is really nice to have a place to store your own beverages or leftovers from the great restaurants for the next day's lunch (or any of the city's great chocolatesâ€_.).It also has a nice 24 hour health facility with treadmills, elipticals, wights, etc. When I went to it at night there was almost nobody else there, and they had headphones available for anyone who didn't bring their own (although the TV selections on the treadmill were limited, and a strange collection outside the broadcast networks).Although I have never used it, they also seem to now have a very extensive room service menu. I have never been to the restaurants the hotel currently has, or the lovely breakfast snack bar available in the morning. Several years ago I went to the upper bar area which has a great view.The staff is always great, and the bed and pillows wonderfully comfy. Definitely a great and relaxing place to stay!",8-Dec-16,5
"This hotel is right off Union Square, so if this the the area you want to be in it couldn't be more convenient. And if you've stayed at a Hyatt hotel before you can expect a certain standard of quality and service. This hotel met most of them. We had a king room on the 29th floor, looking west with a city view, just slightly marred by the top of the Drake hotel across the street (I was told at check in this was already an upgrade from the ""hotel next door"" view on lower floors). Room is modern and stylish in design, with light colored wood furniture, grey carpeting, not large but with adequate space to move around, chair and ottoman by the floor length window, and all the other basics you'd expect: safe, fridge, coffee maker, large LCD TV etc. The bed is the most comfortable we've had on this trip, like a firm futon. Very quiet, the fridge didn't make any noise, didn't hear any neighbors, nor the ice maker across the hall (there's a drinking water dispenser there too which was a nice environmental touch). Bathroom has a large white oval shaped sink, shower has good water pressure. Wifi is fast enough.One thing I was surprised by was the lack of a swimming pool at this hotel, I was under the impression that all Grand Hyatt hotels have one, so that was a disappointment. Although the gym on the top floor is fair sized and has panoramic views. Another was that I made this booking through the Chase LHR program with extra benefits including a continental breakfast. That proved to be a huge source of confusion. It seemed no one at the hotel has any clue as to what that is. We were eventually directed to the ""coffee corner"" at one end of the lobby where there is a kind of food stand selling coffee, pastries etc, but the staff there still had no idea what we could get for this ""continental breakfast"", like, just coffee and pastry? Fruit? I mean, it's not a new program and I couldn't possibly be the first person using it, and how difficult could it be to standardize what's included in a continental breakfast? In the end, everything was charged to our room, and had to be straightened out at check out. So service wise, there is definitely room for improvement here.",8-Dec-16,4
"It's been long overdue but I am writing this review because if as a traveler you are not sure where to stay in San Francisco this hotel should be at the top of your list. The Hyatt is next to Union Square and near great restaurants and shopping if that's something you wish to do. Chinatown is a few blocks away and all the tourist attractions are also nearby. I was pleased with my stay at the hotel since the room were spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Request a room with a view to Union Square, it's worth it. ",8-Dec-16,4
"Great location and fantastic view of Union Square with the Macy's Christmas tree, Christmas lights and skating rink. Last minute booking was managed very promptly and efficiently. We were offered and upgrade which cost only a small amount extra- so worth the view. ",7-Dec-16,4
"Best hotel - quality service from staff and located in a convenient area. The Apple Store is next door, Starbucks across the street and Macy's and Westfield shopping area is a couple blocks away. Friendly staff who gave great eating places advice. Housekeepers are great - room was cleaned in a timely manner. ",7-Dec-16,5
Loved this hotel! Very modern clean and beautiful. Stayed here for two days with my boyfriend for a weekend in the city and glad we decided to stay here. Our view from our room over looked union square which is such a nice view during the holiday season! ,7-Dec-16,5
"Fabulous location, beautifully appointed/renovated. Great bar and the staff was lovely! Very much enjoyed a really relaxing stay....Loved every aspect of this hotel and our stay there. I can't wait to go back!!",7-Dec-16,5
"The best thing about this hotel is the location. Really close to Union Square and in the center of the city.The inside just felt a little old and not in a good way. They tried to update a lot of the surfaces with modern finishes. The floor plan is pretty small so I think most rooms were near one of the 6 elevators and I heard the noise of it going up and down all night.I've stayed at other hotels in San Fran that were better, and would only consider coming back here again if the price was significantly lower or I needed some Hyatt points.",6-Dec-16,4
The location is the best thing. And then the staff are friendly and helpful. The view from the top floors was awesome. Best for business and family vacation. I wish they include a children playroom and possibly a pool on the top floor for guests.,6-Dec-16,5
"Our family of four stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square for four nights this December , this is my overall impression and review. The location is the best in The City, Union Square is the heart of The City and is close to stores, parks, shopping and many restaurants. Since its the holiday season they had a skating rink in the center of the square whcih my 9 year old enjoyed immensely. Checkin was easy and quick, we upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the 20th floor, with a city view. The suite was a king bedroom and a separate sitting room, with two full baths. The common areas are elegant, with a sitting area with a fireplace. Street access is convenient .The service is superb, no complaints .The suite itself , and I can only comment on this one , had some oddball furniture, like this too big double circle coffee table in the center of the front room. Since we had two children, one a 2 year old we needed a crib so this table with the crib inside made the room seem smallish.I'm in the tile business, so the criticism is due to my own perspective. The floors were laminate, not my choice for a suite in a top notch hotel. They had a few large throw rugs which I found weird and kitschy. The bathrooms were large, with these giant sinks, you could wash a baby in and we did! The bathtub was large, the floors a 12 x24 porcelain, which was fine. I like marble and in an expensive hotel this is what I expect. The king bed was very comfortable but the pillows weren't down, so didn't like this.The thermostat was a bit tricky, to get heat you had to turn it up to 85 then heat kicked in then you could adjust the temp. The bathroom in the bedroom was also large with these unique maroon red glass counter tops and another huge sink.The shower was large, but had 6x6 porcelain on the shower floor, which in my business is a no no, too slippery.But overall ok.They had these electric blinds that came down to shut out all light at night which I liked.Overall a very good hotel in a terrific location with very good service.Recommend it to anyone.",6-Dec-16,4
Planned a last minute trip to SF with the family and booked our room here! It was a lovely hotel with an awesome staff. Our room had a great view of the mountains as well. Not to mention Each Morning was a different complimentary breakfast!,5-Dec-16,5
"Easy, mobile check-in. Had room on high floor but never had to wait for an elevator and never made more than one or two stops going up or down. Beautiful views. Room was spacious and very modern. Staff were friendly. Only drawback was restaurant which served only OK food. Very convienent to all SF attractions.Would definitely stay here again but eat elsewhere.",5-Dec-16,5
"I stay at this hotel frequently and it never disappoints. My room had a nice view of the city and was clean with modern amenities. The hotel is literally on Union Square so convenient to shopping and restaurants. The club level is very nice with a stunning view, but frequently crowded. Check in was easy and online check out was available. I decided to stay in one evening and the Concierge was very helpful in recommending a restaurant that delivered.",4-Dec-16,5
"My family of three spent five nights here just prior to Thanksgiving. We had an executive suite with two bathrooms, and at checkin we opted to add on the Club lounge for an additional $50 per night. Our teen daughter said it was the best hotel we've ever stayed at.Our room was around the corner from the elevator. While I could hear the elevator, at first I thought it was wind outside. It was more white noise than annoying or intrusive. We had an issue with the toilet running all night, and called the front desk first thing in the morning. Maintenance came up within minutes and fixed it, as we never had another issue with it during our stay. The room was really dark due to the automatic shades, and the temperature stayed what you set it at. It was wonderful! We loved having lounge access. I know the week before Thanksgiving isn't a really high occupancy period, but the only time we had problems finding seating was if we went 15-20 minutes before breakfast was over. At 7:30 or 8 am, you had your choice of seats, including by the windows with the gorgeous views. You could see Alcatraz Island, Coit Tower, etc. Each day for breakfast there were scrambled eggs and omelette toppings such as ham, bacon, tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, green onions. Some days there were bacon and sausage. There were always whole and cut fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, pastries, bagels with cream cheese, smoked salmon, red onion, capers, etc. We loved the machine that would make various espresso drinks. You could take bottled juices and water to go.Employees were wonderful, and the hotel was incredibly convenient if you have shopping on your agenda. Lots of restaurants within walking distance, and very convenient to public transportation as well. There were always multiple Lyft drivers within 1 minute of the hotel if we felt like going somewhere without waiting for a cable car or bus. We would definitely stay there again.",3-Dec-16,5
Hotel is in a great location near union square and tons of restaurant. The rooms are smaller than most hotels I guess due to location. Went there with family but staff wasn't as friendly for Grant Hyatt..checked in but wasn't even recognize or thanked as a platinum member. I let it go not worth the hassle since they didn't even care (I've stayed in the past on business and was treated better). Not sure if I would come back to stay here again. Parking at the hotel via Valet is very expensive at $67...park across the street at half price.,2-Dec-16,3
Perfectly located among the shopping district and a quick Uber ride to the Piers. Amenities are nice with a very good restaurant and bar area on the second floor. Work out area has terrific views. Everything in SF is expensive but there were some things that I even thought were exorbitant. $40-50 a day to park and $3 for a 6 oz soda were among some of the over the top costs. Rooms were decent sized and beds were comfortable. All in all a very good visit.,2-Dec-16,4
"It's tough to get a room and at a good price due to the quality level and location. But if you can, it's great. The staff is courteous & friendly. The location in Union Square can't be beat. During the holidays if you can score a union square view, it's so lovely to watch the ice skaters and the lights. The room is ok. Basic. Nice firm bed but overall could use a touch of tlc. My bathroom door didn't close all the way(sliding) and the shelf in the empty mini fridge was off its hinge. Super basic amenities cuz I suppose as a cost cutting move you have to call down for anything extra to be delivered. Kind of takes the quality down a notch but the send the stuff up pretty quickly. Overall a solid hotel, just probably not worth the $400 or $500 it sometimes charges!",1-Dec-16,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt to celebrate our 10th anniversary. We booked a Bay View room which was only slightly more expensive than a regular room. It was TOTALLY worth the few extra dollars. The view was fantastic. The room was very comfortable and clean. The location is great and within walking distance to TONS of restaurants. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back.",1-Dec-16,5
"This is a great hotel in a perfect location. We stayed here to kick off the holidays. The Union Square view is awesome. The hotel is updated, clean and within walking distance to restaurants and shops. We will definitely be back next year.",1-Dec-16,5
"Great service, room quality, cleanliness, and location! Much of the shopping and Union square within walking distance. Room was clean and well-maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful whenever we needed assistance. Normally I don't think I'd be able to afford a room here, but they were having a holiday prepaid discount and it was definitely worth it!",1-Dec-16,5
Grand Hyatt at Union Square is the most convenient hotel one could ask for.It's a functional hotel with no frills but every thing is available around the corner. It is a paradise for shopping as it is surrounded by shops including high end ones.The rooms are clean and the staff polite and helpful.It's value for money!,30-Nov-16,5
I love this hotel - have stayed here several times. Never really see the staff but know they are all taking care of anything i need. Super clean - great views - simple and elegant accommodations. The location is perfect. Only regret is that they turned the top floor bar/restaurant into a banquet room for meetings....kind of a bummer - but seems to be more lucrative and the way most too-top venues are going in SF. Love the GH!,30-Nov-16,5
Excellent location great service close to shopping and fine dining. Staff interaction was wonderful with directions. Parking was pricey need to work with your Diamond Members and others clients regarding this matter. Taxes is everywhere on the bill...whoa!!,30-Nov-16,5
"Try to get one of the rooms overlooking Union Square and Macy's store front. Like #2520 which is at corner, or higher. Well worth it during the holidays when ice skaters are out in force and the square is decked out. ",30-Nov-16,5
"Union Square was my choice of location in SF and I generally like newer hotels, Grand Hyatt was a great choice for me this time.With apparent renovation, the lobby was very welcoming with fire places and super tall ceiling. I sat at the lobby sofa area many times sipping my coffee bought from the coffee cart right there. It was sure a wonderful way to spend time in cold early mornings reading book/newspapers next to real fire place. Free apples at the lobby too...Front desk service was average, no surprise with any hotel in North America. Room was decent size and ours had a ""in your face"" Union Square view. Bathroom was clean, new but not enough towel racks as a short coming with many other Hyatt hotels I have stayed. We had to be creative to find places to hang our wet towels. Beds were super comfortable.Had a nice time at the bar lounge with live music and friendly waitresses.Breakfast buffet was not spectacular but then again, there were many good choice eateries and quick bites on Union Square so it was no problem for us. I give this hotel high rating for facility updates, well designed public space and price rather reasonable. Overall, a good Grand Hyatt experience again.",29-Nov-16,4
"This is one of the best hotels. Love the friendly staff, and the great service all employees have provided for me and my family. Very helpful in finding place to eat and things to do. Great great great.",29-Nov-16,5
Had a very pleasurable 4-night stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. Room overlooked Union Square which gave a great view of the Macy's Christmas Tree Lighting Celebration. The Executive Suite Room offered a luxurious stay. The neighborhood is pricey and there are more affordable options for great food in SF but we found the Hotel's restaurant and bar worth the convenience of location after long days of walking around.,29-Nov-16,5
Took my wife to San Francisco for her birthday. From the time we got out of the car we were greeted with exceptional care from the bell men to the front desk. Sent up a complementary bottle of wine and cheese with the best view of the bay. Walking distance to many attractions/land marks. Would definitely stay here again.,29-Nov-16,5
"Our vacation was such an unforgettable experience. Everyone from reservation to all the staff at Grand Hyatt are extremely friendly and helpful. Salute to the Front Desk Mgr. who made our stay extremely unforgettable. The location of the hotel is just a hop away with all the big shops, ice skating rink for the holiday and the lighting of the Christmas tree. These are just a few your family will talk about for many days after their vacation but most of all is our stay at the Hyatt is just something you would dream to come back soon.",29-Nov-16,5
"i rarely have any complaints with this great union square hotel. last time i stayed though, i did complain about members of the staff ignoring the dont bother door sign and just entering the room. it was a busy thanksgiving weekend and maybe they mistook it for a room that was checked out. but it happened twice so i complaind and wanted to talk to the manager who never responded to my request. i even left a message when we checked out. i just hope that those are not bad apples from their wonderful staff who are randomly ""checking out"" occupied rooms, its black friday and rooms are full of shopping bags. i wanted them to be aware of it but unfortunately no one is ever available to address this problem. otherwise, its a great hotel, and i would probably stay there in the future but now more observant",28-Nov-16,4
"I almost did not choose this hotel because there were some mixed reviews, mainly concern about the noise of the traffic. We were on the 23rd floor and we heard no outside noise whatsoever. The rooms are very clean, the staff makes you feel as though you are at a 5 star hotel. The location could not have been better. It is right in the middle of Union Square close to Chinatown, shops, restraunts. I loved our trip and I am so happy we picked this hotel.",28-Nov-16,5
"The hotel is located in a prime, pleasant area of the Union square, and the bay and union square views are breathtaking. We've stayed at the Hyatt quite a few times, and magic is still there.Small tip: union square king room is considerably more comfortable compare to the double.",28-Nov-16,5
"We had an excellent weekend getaway, catching a show, dinner and a romantic stay at the Grand. The staff was exceptional and went out of their way to take care of us. Enjoyed room service for breakfast and a late check out. The staff really took great care of us.",27-Nov-16,4
"The Grand Hyatt is an excellent choice for anyone visiting San Francisco. The location is right in the middle of all the places you would want to visit. Its close to shopping and dozens of restaurants. The hotel itself is very clean and modern. Our room looked up to date and was clean, spacious, and comfortable. A decent sizes flat panel TV and a small refrigerator (not a minibar) were nice touches. The hotel is taller than the buildings around it so you are almost ensured a great view. The only minor criticism I can come up with is the bathroom door. The door is a fancy looking gizmo that rolls sideways on a track. It looks modern and cool but when its closed, it leaves open gaps on both sides and thus prevents complete privacy. Overall, we were very happy with our stay.",27-Nov-16,4
"Grand hyatt San Francisco it one the best hotel in San Francisco, location staff VERY good friendly good location, Grand hyatt foods need upgrade, ideally best place in town. Rooms are large new. Enough space than grand hyatt than in many hyatt. ",27-Nov-16,5
"The Hyatt Grand is truly one of my favorite hotels, always beautiful & clean, fantastic upper floor suites with sweeping city scape views, and the Union Square area. Macy's is right down the street & ice rink with shopping all around setup for Holiday experience- great place to stay for Union Square festivities! The one Up hotel restaurant has an excellent lunch!",26-Nov-16,5
"Booked the wrong date but they were so gracious and got us into a room over Thanksgiving week. Got an upgraded room and early check-in. Great experience, amazing service all around. Hyatt loyalist from now on.",25-Nov-16,5
"Hotel staff were very welcoming and calm. The hotel was very business like and professional. The tour desk staff were helpful. Rooms were of a very high standard. We had a bay view room, which was great but we could not see the bay until around 11am in the morning due to the mist and by 3pm the miss came back.Other guests were considerate and kept noise to the minimum.The breakfast buffet service was efficient and managed well in the small space. The bar and restaurants were also great. Food was good all round and the staff were friendly, helpful and good at their jobs.This hotel is close to Union Square and in the best location for the shopping, Less than a 5 min walk to Market Street for the shopping centre and Powell Street for the cable car rides. and getting the hop on hop off tour buses.We would definitely go back.",25-Nov-16,5
"All aspects of our stay were very positive. We were well taken care of by the staff and thoroughly enjoyed our week-end. The view from our room was spectacular. We had access to the club room where the food and snacks were great. The location of the hotel is very convenient to to shopping, buses, and taxi service.",25-Nov-16,5
"Great value , close to everything. Great holiday decoration in the hotel. Gym with great view.They sent handy man to check the AC immediately. He was courteous and professional. Our room had fantastic bay view",25-Nov-16,1
"Loved staying at the Grand Hyatt; everything is so convenient and within walking distance. Food is excellent, rooms are very comfortable and we had a balcony room so that the door could be opened. Love the fresh air in San Francisco!",24-Nov-16,5
"Valet was great. They took care of unloading everything and placing on my room. Check in was a breeze. Beautiful view of Union Square. Everything is close by. Concierge went above and beyond. Check out was simple. Great staff, great housekeeping. Had slippers and robes in waiting for us in our room. ",24-Nov-16,5
"This hotel, while nothing to get too excited about is a very comfortable hotel that is conveniently located right off Union Square in San Francisco. It is very large and has large well appointed rooms that have everything that a business traveller would need. It doesn't have anything particularly charming about it as its pretty standard issue for a chain hotel, but it absolutely does the trick and is fairly well priced given how expensive San Francisco is.",23-Nov-16,3
"I enjoyed my stay. clean room, absolutely no bedbugs and great service! will stay again and recommend to others. the only drawback was some noise at night, but I suppose that is only to be expected at such a central location. i am a light sleeper and was still able to get good sleep even with some noise. service was very attentive and the room was kept very clean and stacked with every-day needs. the food in the oneup was great and so was the chef and staff! great value and quality food. me and my daughter had a great time. the concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful.",23-Nov-16,5
"We loved our room, the location of the hotel and the friendliness of everyone. It was beautifully appointed and so comfortably contemporary. We felt like true guests rather than having rented a room for a night.",23-Nov-16,5
Convenient downtown location across from Union Square...friendly service...rooms on the small side with small bathrooms. Hotel rooms are starting to show signs of wear...club lounge has lively views and service is wonderful....breakfast is quitefilling and Ben is most helpful and hospitable. Parking very expensive. Would stay here again if the need arises,23-Nov-16,4
"We found the Grand Hyatt to be very modern, clean, and comfortable. We stayed on the Club Level which provides a lounge where breakfast, evening hors d'oevres, desserts, and cocktails are served. However, I would not recommend paying the extra price to stay on the Club Level at the Grand Hyatt. Sadly, the food offered in the lounge was mediocre at best. There are very few options to choose from and the food is either cold, tasteless, or both. We have enjoyed the club level at the Hyatt both in Maui and Hyatt Regency on the Embarcadero in San Francisco and had a very different experience. Both of these offered delicious food with a wider variety to choose from. ",22-Nov-16,4
"We had a perfect stay.Our room was clean, cozy,comfy and very well decorated. View was great.Excellent location.. Just a block away from union square and easy walk to cable car, financial district,etc.. Liked their buffet breakfast.. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful..All in all, Grand Hyatt San Francisco was amazing and is highly recommendable",21-Nov-16,4
"I was in room 3203 with grand club access. Firstly, the room was great. The view from up there was amazing, and great to see the sunset. There was no noise from the lifts, or from outside as some people in other rooms had complained about but occasionally we could hear trolleys of drinks being taken to the grand club room. It didn't bother us but it might wake light sleepers. The shower was good but no bath, which would have been nice.I'd paid extra for a grand club room and when I read some reviews on here wondered if I'd made a mistake... I don't think I did. The breakfast was good, soft drinks, tea/ coffee and cookies during the day were welcome and while the evening food wasn't a main meal, it was tasty and on one evening after a large late lunch it did provide enough food to keep me going until the morning. The staff were very friendly and professional. In particular, Wayne at check-in. I hope we do bump into him at a Depeche Mode concert in the summer! ",16-Nov-16,5
Excellent hotel. All aspects of our stay were addressed. The concierge was very knowledgeable of the sights and how to get around the city. Staff was efficient and on top of things. Definitely recommend this hotel.,15-Nov-16,5
"Excellent location. Nice hotel with lots to do all around. Rooms seemed updated and nicely decorated. So easy to walk around Union Square, Financial District, Chinatown, Moscone Center, South of Market, etc. Great food all around and easy to get quick supplies from Walgreens and CVS on every corner -- and Starbucks too!",15-Nov-16,5
5 star experience all around. Allowed us to check in at 11 am. Good sized room 429. Really beautiful water view. And a view of an ice skating rink. Nice bathroom with vanity and sink separate from the shower toilet. Hair dryer available. Asked for a toothbrush and razor and got really awesome products complimentary. They will also let you borrow a curling iron if you forget yours. The best!,14-Nov-16,5
"Our entire experience was a 10! Everyone was amazing! The gal who checked us in new it was a special occasion (my 50th bday and trip with my mom) - so she gave us access to the Grand room which made our day every morning! Our room wasnâ€™t ready when we checked in after 3:00, so they gave us access to the Grand room (32nd floor) until our room was ready. We were going to miss our dinner reservations, so the manager came to us and said they will move our luggage to a temporary room that we can get ready for dinner in so that we could make our reservations, and they would move our luggage to our permanent room once it is ready. They took care of us beyond our expectations. The concierge even put cupcakes on my bed when we arrived in our room on my birthday with a hand created birthday card -- so beyond our expectations and VERY sweet!!! I will always stay at the Hyatt brand -- you blew me away! WELL DONE everyone!",13-Nov-16,5
"Rooms are modern and clean. Had requested some items via E-Concierge ahead of my stay, which were not delivered when I arrived. Requested them again the next day and they were promptly delivered. Requests made through the regular reservation system did go through. Hotel is centrally located. Starbucks is right across the street - great option for an affordable breakfast. Coffee maker was available in the room and was much appreciated. Check in and check out took no time at all.",12-Nov-16,5
On the 27th floor with spectacular views.The 32nd floor Grand Club is a great way eat well for not too much money.The location is close to everything and the staff very helpful.Highly recommended - would stay again.,12-Nov-16,5
Stayed for four nights. Great central location near Union Square. The room was clean but dated... gym on the top floor is very small and extremely busy in the mornings. Breakfast options are very limited due to the small restaurant on the ground floor - you have to wait 20 minutes for a table!! Better option is the Starbucks across the street.,12-Nov-16,3
The hotel has a very odd configuration putting almost all rooms adjacent to one of their elevators. Earplugs come along with the room because the noise from the elevators can be heard clearly in the rooms. Wouldn't stay here again.,9-Nov-16,3
"Very nice hotel. More a feeling of a boutique hotel than a big chain hotel. Friendly staff, especially front door staff. Concierge was also very helpful. Her recommendations about a restaurant in Chinatown was wonderful. ",8-Nov-16,4
Convenient location for walking through the city. And the front door staff was very helpful both in giving directions and in telling us whether we could really walk because of hills that were between the hotel and the site,8-Nov-16,4
"I had the opporunity of stayng 3 nights at the hotel. The location couldn't be better, one block from the Union Square and near to all major shops and nice restaurants, with easy access to the main attractions. The rooms are very nice. Beds are super comfortable, TV has a huge variety of channels, nice bathroom and decent closet space. Some desapointments for a hotel that is supposed to be a 5 stars hotel: Ammenities are from an unknown brand and are pretty much standard; an empty minibar in a room guaranteed by a credit card (looks pretty cheap for a hotel like this). About the service, I had a feeling of nothing than standard service, from check-in to concierge. No one was really much engaged to offer a great experience or a different approach. Used the concierge once for a restaurant. Was expecting for a concierge that knows what's the talk of the town, and found just a guy that was aware of the restaurants nearby. Had a good choice, but wasn't close to exceed any of our expectations. Just felt like I was in a huge hotel with nice rooms. One exception must be made: Steve, the associate in charge of mail/expedition was FANTASTIC, understood our needs and offered solutions, just like we would expect from the other areas.Bottom line, I could come back to this hotel, managing to have fewer expectations.",8-Nov-16,4
Stayed at Grand Hyatt for a conference. Convenient location to many shops and restaurants as well as to public transportation. Rooms are average size and well-appointed. Front Desk staff were not especially friendly. Servers in the banquet were excellent. Banquet meals were exceptional. ,8-Nov-16,4
"This looks like a very nice hotel, but the rooms are ill-equipped for business travelers. Only two inconvenient power outlets in the room for charging devices, and staff unable to figure out how to process sharing a room among two credit cards. In a hotel of this nature, those mistakes just shouldn't happen.",8-Nov-16,3
"Walked into the hotel after arriving from the Airport, took the BART ($8.95) and was immediately helped by an associate and quickly got up to my room. Very well appointed and loved the electric shades, especially in the Morning! The bathroom was very up to date, the only negative was the size of the Vessel sink. It was really too big for the counter and did not allow much space on either side for toiletries. Shower was good and towels were a comfortable size. Everything was very clean and bed was very comfortable. Many TV stations to choose from.",8-Nov-16,5
Great location for my needs. Clean and comfortable. Food was good however not many choices in hotel. Very close to multiple eating and drinking options though. Wish they had a hot tub to soak my aching feet after walking all day.,8-Nov-16,4
"Our room was clean and comfortable. The view was exceptional. Our room was on the 28th floor over looking the bay. Elizabeth at the concierge was friendly, knowledgeable, and took care of us. Overall stay was great. Perfect location, close to everything.",8-Nov-16,5
Not satisfied with customer service...room could use some TLC. Location was great and the doormen was very courtesy. I can't say the registration staff were not frieindly but she did not follow through.,8-Nov-16,3
"This hotel was perfect. I researched many hotels before selecting this one for our stay. It is in a great location, close to everything. Everyone was very friendly except for the hostess in the Grand Club. She questioned how I got in there and looked at me like I did not belong. Sorry I just finished working out and went to grab something to take to my room. We stayed in the executive suite and it was worth every penny. We had plenty of room to spread out. We had dinner reservations somewhere else but decided to order room service here for dinner since the room and view were amazing.",8-Nov-16,5
"Grand Hyatt San Francisco is amazing and highly recommendable. Always enjoying my stays there as the hotel is next to Union Square, close to city centre and its easy to arrange transport with Uber and other providers. It is highly recommendable to stay there.",8-Nov-16,5
"The hotel is fantastically located moments from Union Square. The building is hard to miss towering as it does thirty plus floors high. The rooms are more than comfortable though perhaps a little bland for my taste. The f&b venues are good and the service in these outlets was excellent. What let's the hotel down though is the total lack of service from doormen and the general vibe of the lobby. The awful red queue sign with a you're next notification and an arrow at the front desk is more reminiscent of a social security office rather than a supposedly upscale five star hotel. The doormen are monumentally unfriendly. Not once did they offer to help with luggage, call a taxi or open a car door. I'm actually curious what they are there for? It certainly seems not to help the guests. It was a perfectly acceptable hotel. A good standard but nothing exceptional and certainly not up to the standard I have come to expect from a Grand Hyatt. ",7-Nov-16,3
"Well appointed rooms, very helpful staff, terrific location (just off Union Square); easy and free Wifi connection; comfortable bed; good bathroom amenities. What else does one need??? Check-in process was made very easy by friendly staff.Fully stocked Starbucks immediately across the street (important for those travelers like me who need easy access to the NY Times!).",7-Nov-16,5
"The service and accommodations at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco live up to one's expectations. From the Door Men (and there seemed to be more than one helping open doors, welcoming you, etc.) to desk clerks, staff was pleasant and very professional. The location cannot be better for shopping, strolling, museum going, etc. I've stayed at least 5 times in the last 20 years, and the quality never wavers.",7-Nov-16,5
Great location! Great value compared to many of the other high end hotels in the area made choosing the Grand Hyatt a no-brainer. The hotel restraunt/lounge is very convenient but be ready to pay for this convenience. ,6-Nov-16,5
Awesome stay and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous in every interaction. Quick check in process with a great welcoming committee. The concierge staff was very helpful in letting you know the highlights of the city and getting you from point A to point B. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,5-Nov-16,5
Grand Hyatt Union square fell short of the Hyatt name I expected. Hotel has great location but outdated and not very clean.Bathroom sink was cracked lighting around mirror was stained. Cabinet where towels are placed was stained. Shower had very poor pressure. Room had piles of dust hanging on the walls. I not a clean room freak but this stuff just stood out. It was a anniversary trip and didn't feel so special in this room.,4-Nov-16,2
Great for tourist and business traveler. Very close to union square and chinatown. This hotel is always very crowd and all the staff seems really busy. But room is big and very clean. will recommend to friends and family.,4-Nov-16,4
"I got to the hotel late after a long day of working and flying, used the electronic room key (iPhone) so skipped the check-in area, and went straight to my room where I walked in the door and thought ""THIS is why I love staying at Hyatt."" Spacious, well-appointed rooms with a great view of the city. I didn't have much interactions with the hotel staff, but when I did they were always helpful and friendly. And the location is ideal. Definitely my first choice for San Francisco.",3-Nov-16,5
"Highlights: Great central location, friendly staff! Room for improvement: rooms need to be updated, the carpet in my room has multiple stains. Standard amenities should be provided in the room not upon request - that's just tacky. The breakfast selection, quality and presentation needs the most attention. My omelette was over cooked and slapped on a plate with potatoes. I've had better at a Dennys. I expect more from Hyatt. Definitely a far cry from the luxurious Hyatt hotels I've had the pleasure of frequenting in Asia. ",2-Nov-16,3
Excellent location and interiors. The club lounge is also well stocked with great views. Only downside is the gym - it's really too small for such a big hotel and it gets very crowded in the mornings.,2-Nov-16,5
"We had a reservation at the Grand Hyatt and received an email from them suggesting online check in which we did. When we arrived we still had to go to the registration desk, our room was not ready, no comparable rooms were available and the staff agreed that registering on line was a waste of time. Only after we insisted on seeing a manager did they even pretend to want to be helpful. There are many good hotels in San Francisco. This is not one of them. ",2-Nov-16,2
We stayed here during Fleet Week. Reserve any room with bay view. Higher floors are better for views of the bay. Staff very friendly. You can walk to most places but ride share with Uber or Lyft is good also. I would not pay extra for breakfast. Too many places to enjoy outside the hotel. Pinecrest Diner is just a few blocks from hotel. Chinatown is just around the corner.,2-Nov-16,5
"Exceptionally well designed room. Great view, ability to open window for ventilation. Newly renovated and very well done. Service was always excellent in every area of the hotel. Love Hyatt, this is my new favorite in SF.",2-Nov-16,5
Everything went extremely well. Great location. Entire staff was top notch. Great accommodations. Courteous and instant resolution to any questions or issues. It was especially nice having a free water fountain on the floor and Starbucks in the lobby. Concierge was especially helpful and very knowledgeable. Great car valet service. Worth the money. I especially want to thank the lost and found dept. I left my car keys and medication in the safe. I called the hotel and they immediately identified the lost items and they were delivered to my home the next day. This hotel is top notch and they really have their act together. Best customer service I have ever seen. I will definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt next time in SF,2-Nov-16,5
"A friend and I stayed at this hotel as we visited friends and toured Napa. It is located in the heart of the city so that getting around is easy. It's beautiful, contemporary, friendly with meticulously efficient staff, and offers outstanding concierge services. The evening and night views of the skyline are breathtaking. There was not a view of the water as it's downtown. Easy to walk to Bart, shops and activities. I'd stay there again without a doubt. ",2-Nov-16,5
"This hotel is very large and so crowded, check in process was quick and simple (they have a bowl of Ghirardelli chocolates). The room I got was noisy from somewhere so I ask to move and they moved me to a different room on the same floor which was much better. The room is spacey with a great bath, very large bed.The location is exceptional right next to union square, its best if what you desire is shopping, just hope out and in to leave your bags.They billed me by mistake for a breakfast I didn't order but refunded immediately when I called the Hyatt service. There is a parking garage just opposite the hotel, which I used for the weekend.As other people stated there is a small gap between the door to the room and the floor so you can hear when someone is passing by, for me it didn't cause any trouble",31-Oct-16,4
"Great location hotel with fabulous views. Even though it has been refurbished it felt a little dated compared to other Grand Hyatt's although that's a minor issue. The staff were friendly and very helpful. As we arrived late after a long drive we dined in the restaurant in the hotel that turned out to be excellent. The waitress was very knowledgeable and suggested some good dishes - it was also good value in a very expensive city. The one let-down was an empty mini-bar in the room that gave the impression of a rather ""low rent"" approach in an otherwise top quahlity hotel.",30-Oct-16,4
"I would've preferred to stay at a Hilton, where I have status, but a conference I was attending was at this hotel so I stayed here.The hotel is less than a block from Union Square, which has various options for shopping and eating, but there were some questionable people lingering in the square and following people around and that didn't exactly make me feel comfortable. The hotel itself is very nice and has modern decor. I had a room on the 11th floor that was large and comfortable and had two double beds. My preference is a king bed, but the hotel was sold out so I had no alternative. The double bed was too small, but it was comfortable and the pillows and linens were nice. The room had a large flat screen TV, a large work desk, a small safe, a mini fridge, and I especially liked the window shades that could be raised or lowered at the push of a button. The bathroom was modern and clean with fluffy towels and June Jacobs brand toiletries. The sink was pretty cool, but it took up too much of the counter space. Overall, the room was nice, but I have two complaints. First, there weren't enough power outlets around the room. There were 2 outlets on the side of the nightstand, but I couldn't easily find them from the other bed as they weren't visible. It would be more convenient if the plugs were on top of the night stand, as they would be more easily accessible. Second, I could hear the motors from the elevator all night long, and my room wasn't even directly against the elevator shaft. I could also hear loud/drunk guests late at night, which isn't the hotel's fault, but also a testament to how thin the walls/doors are.Surprisingly, the WiFi was complimentary and it was speedy, so that was nice.I had breakfast in the room one morning and it was overpriced and mediocre.Overall this was a nice hotel, but it was just too expensive for me. I realize hotels in San Francisco are on the pricier side, but for what they charge here, I'd rather stay in a Hilton.",29-Oct-16,4
"My family and I have just spent two nights at this recently refurbished Hyatt property.The location is perfect for a business or pleasure trip to San Francisco, with great shopping and public transport all within easy reach. The rooms are pleasantly furnished and we were lucky to be assigned at room on the 30th floor, which provided fantastic views over Union Square and the San Francisco skyline. Major construction work are ongoing at Union Square, but these did not disrupt our stay in anyway.Hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge was one of the best teams we have experienced and it is worth paying a little extra for the limousine service on your return to the airport.",29-Oct-16,5
"We stayed as part of a vacation for our 20th wedding anniversary. At check-in, we were pleasantly surprised to be assigned a room on the 20th floor and provided a choice of wine and apps to be delivered. This is the type of over and above service we appreciate in a hotel! The room was quiet and comfortable. Parking rates were outrageous, but likely ot out of the realm of normal for San Francisco. Next time we would skip the car and just Uber.",28-Oct-16,5
"As a Diamond member my wife and I have stayed at a lot of Hyatt's. This was hands down, by far the worst. I've had a few experiences where the check in staff at other Hyatt hotels fail to recognize my membership level and I have to remind them in order to get the benefits. However, I have never had a Hyatt try and demote me from Diamond to Platinum and that is exactly what they did here. Check in staff was extremely rude and didn't believe that I was Diamond and didn't want to offer the benefits. After I pulled up my account on the app to show them they very rudely said ""you booked the stay when you were Platinum status"". Nope, wrong again and that could have easily been checked if they were willing to click about 3 keys on the keyboard to see that I have been Diamond for a year now. When I asked about the standard Diamond upgrade they claimed they were completely full and had no other rooms. Wrong again, they had other rooms and I later demanded to move after finding they put us in an ADA room with a very awkward bathroom. Rooms are old, small, and poorly insulated. House keeping took 3 hours to bring us a new fridge after telling them ours wasn't working. Club lounge is about one fourth the size it should be. After our stay the assistant front office manager, Jonathan Hsieh, sent me a pathetic fake apology through email about the Diamond mix up. He claimed that he ""tried"" to call my room while I was there. Once before I had an issue at a Hyatt and the Manager called me immediately on my cell phone and after our conversation not only was the issue resolved but I planned 2 more trips there because I was so pleased with the managers customer service. This Hyatt on the other hand is a joke and the staff is a joke. Afterwards we stayed at another Hyatt nearby and they joked that the Grand Hyatt San Francisco has the worst employee turnover out of all Hyatt's because the managers are horrible. BEWARE, STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!",28-Oct-16,1
"Stayed at hotel for four nights on business. My hearing site was around the corner at the Sir Francis Drake, a 5 minute walk. I used the valet service for my car which was excellent. Easy assistance from bell man to move multiple pieces of luggage on arrival and departure. Bathroom and closet were small but adequate for my solo needs.",27-Oct-16,4
"This hotel has been really updated and upgraded nicely. Clean modern feel, nice reception and sitting area, nice ambience. Well done Hyatt! Situated by Union Square and the new apple store its a great location. Only one minor complain, stayed in a lower floor facing the main street and it was surprisingly noisy outside even well into the night.",27-Oct-16,4
"My experience at Grand Hyatt San Francisco was the worst of all other places we stayed this two week. The room at Hyatt was extremely dusty and had to have room service come clean it at check-in. Next day room was dusty again, not sure what was the issue but I think air filter needed to changed. At the checking asked if the room was spaces for our 21mon son and was told to use lobby for him to play around. :( Furthermore, the there was no Duvet cover on the blankets, instead it has two sheets between blankets, which was extremely uncomfortable. We were also extremely disappointed to find out Hyatt didn't have NFL Network Channel. Overall, this was our first experience at Hyatt and I have and had better experience at Hilton and Marriott",27-Oct-16,2
Only thing to say about this hotel is the beds! Holy moly I've never been so comfortable! We did room service one of the nights just so we could crawl straight into that bed! Amazing place and a cool place to stay but the beds are the best I've ever experienced! ,26-Oct-16,4
Large room with comfortable beds. Easy and quick check-in. Breakfast buffet VERY expensive. There is a Starbucks that opens directly across street from hotel and it opens very early. Location is great for catching the train - just outside of front door.Don't ask Concierge for dinner options as they will direct you to very pricey tourist spots. Just walk around and you will plenty of reasonable and quite good options.,26-Oct-16,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt in October. It was a great experience. The hotel is located at union square which makes it very convenient. Union Square is a great shopping area. We were close to Chinatown, only a block away from the cable cars and street cars which helped us get around San Francisco very easily. Only spent a few days in the city but I got to see and do so much in that time. The Concierge was extremely helpful. They assisted us with renting a car twice. The car was delivered to the hotel and was effortless. The concierge was very knowledgeable with the public transportation.saved us time getting to the sites we wanted to see. My room was very nice. The bed was very comfortable, bathroom a nice size and clean. There is a mini fridge and safe- both very small. There was a normal 1875 watt hair dryer which was awesome. Water pressure in shower wasn't the greatest but that's me just being picky. I would definitely use this hotel again. Things I did while in San Francisco- Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, Pier 39 sea lions, Ghirardelli Square, Chinatown, Alamo Square (under construction) to see the Painted Ladies, mosaic steps (great view of the city), Lombard street, Chrissy field (great view of Golden Gate Bridge), Ferry Market. We also spent a day going to Monterey - went to aquarium, drove the 17 mile ride and went to Carmel beach. Another day we went to Muir Woods, Sausalito and Napa Valley. California is amazingly beautiful. It was a great trip. ",25-Oct-16,5
"We spent a long weekend in San Francisco and this hotel was great. Steps away from Union Square, walking distance to the MoMA, and nice walk to the other high lights.Liked the common spaces, decor is very original and funky.",24-Oct-16,4
Great location. Room was modern and updated. Just spent 2 nights prior to a cruise. Easy walk to trolley stops and many restaurants. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was a little pricey but good.,24-Oct-16,5
Great location. Hotel room on high floor with view of Union Square. Amenities in the room have been well thought out. Bed very comfortable.Appreciated very much that we could open the window even though we were on 20th floor as we don't like air-conditioning.I would choose this hotel again as my preferred stay in SanFranciso,24-Oct-16,5
"If you're looking for an excellent location, modern vibe, and very friendly customer service, this is a great selection. I've stayed at other area hotels, including Union Station, though first time here. I'lol be back.",24-Oct-16,4
"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. The rooms are comfortable, with impressive views (see pictures). Quiet if on upper floors. Breakfast is a bit expensive for the quality, and service is slow (so plan some extra time). The one thing I would like to see improved is the gym: It is larger than in most hotels, but then the hotel is larger as well, which means you end up waiting to access weight training machines and dumbbells, which is annoying at this price point",23-Oct-16,5
"First time staying at the Grand Hyatt SF. I was impressed with the overall quality of this hotel, friendliness of the staff and central location. I was well looked after for the duration of my stay and would certainly come back again.",21-Oct-16,4
"Staff was okay, not overly friendly, but certainly not rude. We've stayed at multiple hyatt hotels/resorts and are accustomed to friendlier service. Would definitely recommend this hotel overall. Great value, nice rooms, and amazing location",20-Oct-16,4
We attended a family wedding at the Grand Hyatt and we decided to stay since we lived an hour and a half away. And it was nice knowing we were able to have a few drinks and not drive home :) The location is awesome!,20-Oct-16,4
We stayed here for 2 nights recently.....driving there we thought the area may be dodgy but turns out is in a very nice area...only one block from union square. Check in was very fast and professional and plenty of staff on hand to help at door or at concierge. One surprise was they gave us a nice bottle of wine and dessert once they knew we were celebrating an event! Be sure to check out the Cheesecake Factory which is on top floor of macey's and offers great value food and excellent terrace views of union square and the city surrounds...,19-Oct-16,5
Very nice hotel! Was there for a day interviewing with a company in the Bay Area. Loved my experience. Room with view was great! City view was great. Hotel room seemed to be very well set up and organized. ,19-Oct-16,5
"Me and my girlfriend spent 2 nights at this central hotel in Union Square DT San Francisco. The staff was super friendly, the hotel itself is beautiful, and it is in a great location for all your tourist adventures!",18-Oct-16,5
"Great location in Union Square. The mobile check-in and entry is outstanding! We were also notified when our room was ready. No need to stop at the front desk for check-in. The employees still greeted us at the front door and at the reception area. The hotel and rooms were clean, the bathrooms were a nice size. The sink in the bathroom was an elongated oval which seemed odd, but not a stopper. There were no coffee machines nor refrigerators in the room. That didn't bother me because I don't drink room coffee anyways. There is a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel's front door which was extremely convenient. The fitness center had nice equipment. Each time we went, which was 7 am, it was packed and people were waiting to use equipment. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. ",18-Oct-16,4
"This hotel became my favorite hotel. While I am a huge fan of the Hyatt Huntington Beach and is hard to beat for location, the Grand Hyatt in SF had the best service I've ever received at a hotel. Hands down. All weekend long they blew my mind - every hotel employee I dealt with was literally perfect. It's in the heart of San Francisco and close to everything. The room was great. The food was great. Beautiful view. It was an amazing weekend all around.",17-Oct-16,5
Great location and good service. Club floor very nice for breakfast and snacks. Yes there is noise even on the 34th floor and the construction in the area was overwhelming at times but overall a nice stay.,17-Oct-16,4
"I hesitated on staying here but bit the bullet regarding price and it was worth every penny. Service was great, room was spacious and very nicely appointed. The restaurant One Up was also good--very attentive, good selection of wine, and very tasty food. Great location as well. You cant go wrong staying here.",17-Oct-16,5
"Great Hotel in an awesome location, close to shopping, dinning and an easy cable car ride to the wharf. Our room was clean, quiet with an excellent view of the city. A bit expensive but overall on par with other hotels in the area.",17-Oct-16,5
"Excellent experience and perfect location. We were in town for a conference (at another hotel) and thankfully were able to finish our visit to San Francisco in this hotel. Much better option!! Better location, better service, wonderful in-room food service, and better overall experience.",16-Oct-16,5
Grand Hyatt in heart of SF near Union Square. Hosted wedding party. Very professional and friendly staff. Hosted dinner 14 people in hotel restaurant. Great food. Two friendly servers. Very modern nice rooms. Quiet. Great room service. Free newspaper at floor elevator. Wonderful location to walk in SF. ,16-Oct-16,5
The good:The hotel is beautiful and the room is very nice but i am platinum and used points to upgrade to a club level room. we were given room 3324. Avoid the 24 line at all cost unless you enjoy elevator noice all night ( luckily we travel with earplugs and a noice app) also the shower is the narrowest I am ever been in. The next morning when we called about some other issues we were offered another room but we had already unpacked and we are leaving tomorrow. However I did get some points as an concession to our issues. However you would think platinum and diamond would get the better rooms not the worst line in the hotel. Also there is no way to upgrade to high speed internet as there is no choice. At Check in they warned me that this might be an issue. On the plus side as I said earlier they were willing to move us and the club itself is very nice. ,15-Oct-16,4
"Stayed for business, its a very good location and you can walk downtown anywhere, while the hotel staff was very accommodating. The rooms are a good size, very comfortable - we had absolutely No problem!",15-Oct-16,4
"We stayed in this hotel on my first trip to San Francisco with my husband. It was extremely conveniently located in Union Square, walking distance to lots of great restaurants, bars, and shopping, and just a block from the gates into Chinatown. Uber in San Francisco is fantastic, for just a few bucks you can get anywhere in town. We stayed on the 17th floor and it was very quiet and had lovely views of the city buildings.",14-Oct-16,5
"The entire staff from the bellmen, reception, doormen, concierge and housekeeping could not have been better. It was clear they recognized that they were in the hospitality business. Reception checked us in 2 plus hours early with no issue and helpfully explained the main services available.The bellmen were fast, pleasant and provided local info and referred us to the concierge for additional info.The doormen were helpful getting taxi's and even getting us a black car for the same price as a taxi.The staff at the concierge not only were very knowledgeable about events but were able to get us discounts and also provide info about specialty stores we were looking for.Housekeeping provided us with special requested items and provide room cleaning on request off schedule.All services were provided in a most helpful manor. As I stated in my headline. Everything was special.",14-Oct-16,5
"Nice hotel in downtown. Nice lobby, good food and friendly staff. Clean rooms. Would stay here again and would recommend to friends. Mid range in price but San Fran is expensive. Close to some great restraunts and the business district.",14-Oct-16,4
"This is an updated top of the line Hyatt hotel with stellar management. Everything functioned well throughout the hotel. I experienced their stellar Regency Club with its well earned reputation for excellence. My room was well fitted out, clean, and modern. I will stay again!",13-Oct-16,5
"An beautiful hotel in a wonderful location. The front desk staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable of the local area. The rooms are gorgeous, and we were upgraded to a high floor room with a breathtaking view of San Francisco. The only thing keeping me from giving this hotel 5 stars is the restaurant and bar staff. We tried to go for dinner the first night, the bar was empty yet it took nearly 25 minutes before we were served, so we wound up leaving after drinks only. The following day for breakfast, again the servers were very agnostic and clearly wanted you to use the buffet so they wouldn't have to deal with you. And the last night we tried one more time for dinner, and the service was better than previously, but still just ok.Between the great location, gorgeous clean rooms (oh and super friendly housekeepers, I forgot to mention!) and great front desk staff, I would definitely recommend this hotel, but stay away from the restaurant!",13-Oct-16,4
"This hotel provides all you need for a stay in the centre of San Francisco, the room was spotless and well maintained as you'd expect from a big brand hotel chain. Service was good and whilst I didn't have lunch or dinner at the hotel, I can recommend most things on the breakfast menu. A good home from home when working on business for a week when all you need is things to work as they should without incident.",12-Oct-16,4
"Nice hotel right in the heart of Union Square. Easy access to dining, shopping, bus lines and trolley lines. Priced reasonably compared to other nearby hotels. Nice health club facility on top floor. Views not as great as advertised.",12-Oct-16,4
"My stay at SF grand Hyatt has always been awesome the staff is great, and I have enjoyed my stay each time. The check in was easy, when I had to request items as I forgot they were promptThe grand room service and food was great too",11-Oct-16,5
Beautiful hotel in a great location! Top notch customer service as well! For a hotel that is in a very busy area our room on the 8th floor was extreme quiet. We were here for a 2 day post cruise stay. ,11-Oct-16,5
"Stayed back in June for 2 weeks. Rooms were pretty good, however AC was noisy which kept me awake a bit. Room service was great and F&B hospitality was brilliant. Housekeeping did let down by not changing the sheets, and I had to remind them. I had billing issues at check-out, which got resolved swiftly when I had to show them the printed document. At the time of booking I had issues registering to the gold passport program, and it has been a disaster trying to get anyone to help me, till now its not been sorted and I have simply given up dealing with their call centre. This has impacted the overall experience of my trip and next time I have decided to stay at Westin, next door.",10-Oct-16,3
"When we arrived, Alex Benavide checked us in. Alex was very friendly and helpful. He really took care of us. We had access to the lounge where we had beautiful views and plenty to eat and drink! Drinks were very expensive in the bar-$11 for a draft beer! Overall a great stay!",10-Oct-16,4
"My wife and I arrived at the hotel at 11am after a 14 hour flight from Australia to be told quite curtly that checkin time was 3pm and that the hotel was very busy. As we had lounge access, we said we would wait there if he would be so kind as to let us know when we could access our room. He agreed to do this.After 2 hours, my wife went down to the foyer to check out the state of play and was told my another staff member that our room was ready and had been for some time. Very apologetic and embarrassed.Having survived that hiccup, we went to our lovely room on the 30th floor and with fabulous views. Well appointed with all the usual good quality toiletries etc.We spent a lot of time in the Grand Club ( Lounge ) and found the staff to be friendly, professional and helpful. Top marks to them.It is just unfortunate that what should have been a memorable experience was spoilt before it started.",10-Oct-16,4
"Such a high standard of rooms and service was awesome. From the concierge to the doorman who spoke to us everyday even if we weren't up for a chat. There was nothing the staff couldn't do assist. Even the room service staff would say hello and smile at us constantly. The gym is also awesome even though it is not us large as GH in Melbourne Australia and no free daily water on bedsides which seems to be the US standard but doesn't have to be as Australia can do it so what can't the US? It puzzles me anyway as for the room just stunning, I was initially to be allocated a room on Level 5 and then I asked how many floors high is the building then was upgraded to level 24 for an additional US$10. The room was super clean without a single piece of dust on the bedsides and counter. We loved the man chair with the foot stool and the gorgeous electric blinds and funky shades. Not only did our room have a full length mirror but it also had a bath and the room it self was large and even furnished with lovely vases! Just wow can't wait to go to San Fran again and stay at the Grand Hyatt. I love that there is such a high standard in customer service that the Grand Hyatt normally attains as the Melbourne Australia GRand Hyatt is to this standard whereas NYC was utterly disappointing! ",10-Oct-16,5
"Business trip, I get to the entry hall. Where is the counter? Only see modern designer tables with Macs and friendly attendants that smile at me and almost informally welcome me to this wonderful hotel. My reservation was a standard one, but the lady just decided to upgrade me to a room in an upper floor - with the view to the bay!! Just wonderful experience from the personel, service and of course, great location next to the Union Square.",7-Oct-16,5
"We have stayed at Grand Hyatts a number of times in different cities from Tokyo to New York and they're always of a very good standard and we have always been very pleased with our experience. The room in this hotel (room number 2707) was finished to a high standard and had a great view too; however the noise from the hallway and the adjoining room was simply unacceptable and made our stay very unpleasant. This is because the doors finish too high from the floor, (easily more than an inch) and our room was also a lock off so you could hear right through to the next room, even just them talking, or splashing around in the bath! We ended up stuffing the extra blanket under the door to try and muffle the sound. The rest of the hotel I can't fault but I cannot recommend this hotel and I would not return based upon my experience.",5-Oct-16,2
"We stayed in October for 3 days for business and pleasure. The hotel is very clean, personal ... kind and warm. Cross the street is a starbucks. Next is Apple store. Then some other stores... I mean is a great location. Valet parking is expensive but ... is San Francisco :) .",5-Oct-16,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for work trip, although I was mostly in a conference room - the location seemed wonderful. Lots of shopping, close to transportation, and close to good restaurants. The hotel itself was super modern, the room was big and clean, the restaurant in the hotel itself had good food (although limited) and great drinks. The staff was friendly and accommodating.",5-Oct-16,4
"I stayed at this hotel with my partner in September 2016. The hotel is in a fantastic location and the rooms were very modern and comfortable. The hotel was above our usual price range but so were most places in San Francisco. We stayed for 4 nights and were able to walk to many sites or catch the underground located nearby. My only issue with the hotel relates to an accounting error. We paid for the hotel on a debit card and a pre-authorisation fee was taken on our arrival but also on our departure without our knowledge. For the second part of our trip we travelled to Yosemite National Park and my card was suddenly blocked. I was unable to contact my bank given my location. Luckily I had paid for our accommodation and travel and the place we were staying were kind enough to give us a free meal after a day of hiking! I later discovered (after long phone calls to my bank in UK business hours..) that my account had been blocked as there were two large pre-authorisations pending on my account which had left me overdrawn. My direct debits could not be paid and I had to take an emergency overdraft. I called the Hyatt whilst I was still in the US who denied doing any wrong doing. I have now, however, had confirmation from them that they took two pre-authorisations by mistake and that this was due to a training error. I know many people advise using credit cards to pay for hotels in the US but I could not have anticipated what occurred. I would suggest checking this with the hotel before you leave so that the same does not happen to you.",5-Oct-16,4
"Welcomed with a friendly sincere staff, no wait to check in. The concierge was beyond helpful for our weekend. Our room was very clean and we had an amazing view! We were very happy with this hotel and will come again! ",4-Oct-16,5
Excellent location. Near BART and world class shopping. AT&T park is walkable for people who walk. Onsite restaurant is excellent. Doormen can give you a p/o of their restaurant recommendations. Union Square location is good choice.,4-Oct-16,5
"5 day trip to the beautiful city of SAN Francisco. Stayed in the Grand Hyatt suite and loved everything about the hotel. Awesome room, lovely property in the perfect location for shopping, dining and sight seeing. ",4-Oct-16,5
"Situated right off union square the hotel is in the perfect spot for sightseeing and all the activities aground the Moscone Center conferences. The restaurant OneUp is good as is the bar also. The elevators, even though there are 6, can be slow during peak times especially if you are on the top floor. It doesn't hurt to be beside the Apple Store also. ",4-Oct-16,4
"Had a nice experience. Comfortable and clean room. Good room service. High tech hotel in that they pushed several emails to me allowing me to check in online, order room service online, check out online. 2 minute walk to the great shopping at Union Square. An easy 10 minute downhill walk to Moscone center. 15 minute walk to the embarcadero. I would recommend for those wanting to be centrally located.",3-Oct-16,5
The hotel was very up-to-date with the coolest amenities and had phenomenal views of San Francisco. The staff was extremely kind and helpful and tried to meet out every need. The hotel is also situated in a great part of the city.,2-Oct-16,5
"Excellent central hotel, only used for sleeping as too much in San Francisco to do Staff very friendly and level of cleanliness is ver high.Rooms very spacious and beds and pillows very comfortable.",1-Oct-16,5
"Stayed here for four nights in late September early October. We had a suite, and were blown away by how nice it was. We stayed on the 34th floor with a fantastic view of the city and a partial view of Union Square below. The hotel has a fantastic location to shopping and Chinatown which we took full advantage of. The lobby is also a cool spot to just sit, relax, and people watch during the day. The staff was also great. Very friendly and accommodating. This hotel also has one of the better hotel gyms I've been to. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt San Francisco.",1-Oct-16,5
"Horrible vegan food knowledge. Hard time to explain what is vegan food to the supervisor of the restaurant finally served me butter in the name of vegan food, after explaining him over 30 min what is vegan food and a complaint.",1-Oct-16,3
"Check in was easy. Staff was helpful. Showed me how to print out my airline tickets. I had to go to my business meeting that morning as well as check out. The staff helped me hold my luggage in one of their storage rooms. I was able to enjoy the city after my meeting. Overall, a great experience and I would stay at the SF Grand Hyatt again.",30-Sep-16,5
"Stayed for 4 nights and overall was disappointed with the quality of the hotel. Wifi is an expected service but the strength of signal and stability of the service was very annoying, with it unavailable very often to the point that reverted to going down to the lobby just to access emails, messaging and Internet.Quality of the room was a little dated as well but cleanliness was fine. Can't complain about the reception staff - very helpful.",28-Sep-16,2
"First time here. Normally stay at Parc 55 or Hilton since I am a diamond with Hilton as well and those properties are closer to bart for airport access and the price is usually higher at the Hyatt. I was able to use a suite upgrade certficate the dates I was there was made up for the higher price. The executive suite I had was very nice. I like that they have switches to control the blinds electronically and they are great at keeping light out of the room at night time. I like the check in area, there are kiosks in the lobby for check in instead of a long check in desk .Staff was great. This property offers a $15 Amazon gift card as one of the choice diamond check in ammenities and being a huge Amazon shopper I really appreciate that. Staff was great. Good location, only a few blocks from the muni/Bart and next to the Tix booth and a bike rental kiosk. My biggest complaint is with the lounge. The only hot breakfast item they had was scrambled eggs. The lounge is too small, real difficult to find a seat at breakfast, they could easilly use a lounge double the current size. And they always ran out of items during the happy hour. Other small complaint is there is no dedicated diamond line. There was no wait when checking in (I arrived after 11 p.m. however) but was a wait at check out.",28-Sep-16,5
"Exactly What You Would Expect....well located, efficient, clean, and a reasonable price point. Located just off of Union Square in SF, so it is centrally located for anything touristy one might want to do in SF. Ask for a high floor to take advantage of the spectacular views. ",27-Sep-16,4
"We had a great stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. We especially loved the convenient location and friendly, attentive service. While high-end, the atmosphere is casual and relaxed -- it's a perfect hotel for business as well as a vacation break in the city.",27-Sep-16,5
San Francisco is an amazing city I would love to come back to. It is expensive every penny was very well spent. We were in the Union Square area where everything is close by and there was no need for a car. Public transportation is very good and even tourist attraction were right there. The area is surrounded by local restaurants which makes your stay even more pleasant.,27-Sep-16,4
"The Grand Hyatt was an excellent place to stay during the Oracle OpenWorld show held in San Francisco every year. It's within walking distance to the conference (Moscone Halls) and very near great dining, the waterfront and city attractions. The staff was attentive, the fitness center was well-stocked and maintained, the Grand Club was a convenient and wonderful way to get quick breakfasts before the long conference days started, and the overall experience was a great one. My team and I would highly recommend this hotel.",26-Sep-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt has a good location on union square. It also has rooms the size of shoe boxes, threadbare towels and sheets,paper thin walls and five start prices. This hotel clearly caters to conventions so if you like that all the above, this is the place for you!",26-Sep-16,2
All aspects of my stay was great. The service and comfortable room was key to a restful stay. The location was perfect for my meetings in the financial district and nob hill. Tons of shopping next to hotel as well. ,25-Sep-16,5
"Great place & excellent facilities. The hotel offers peace of mind for any visitor whether on business or leisure. The staff are very pleasant and readily available to offer assistance to the guests always with a smile. The ambience makes the hotel a perfect location for travelers mixing both tranquility and quality of service to make one's stay a very memorable experience. I would definitely recommend it to any friends, colleagues or family travelling in that direction anytime.",25-Sep-16,4
"One of the best locations, just on Union Square and close to all the shopping action. The hotel has a nice courtyard to enjoy a cuppa as well as an Apple store adjacent in case you want to pick the latest iPhone7. The rooms were spacious and beds are comfortable with automatic controls for the blinds and room lighting makes it convenient to operate. The bathrooms were also clean and the wifi network was okay.",25-Sep-16,4
Internet ran at 1990 dialup speeds... actually an old school 56k modem would have been gastwr. Even pandora had problems streaming musoc.a lumpy bed lead to 5 very bad and unproductive nights. At least the Marriott next door gave me free WiFi duento status. Sad part was their signal was better than what I got from the grand hyatt.,24-Sep-16,1
"Upgraded to a Club room which was way over priced for what the hotel offered. Noisy room, windows are not sealed properly and the wind was blowing through them all night. Club lounge is completely inadequate considering the price paid. There are much better hotels providing better value for money in the Union Square area.",24-Sep-16,1
"Stayed in the hotel around 4th July,16. Brilliant hotel. Me and my friend stayed in this hotel for one night. Upon check in, we requested f we can get a ROOM WITH A VIEW. And the room that we had was spectacular. Really nice view of the city and just loved it. Customer service was excellent",23-Sep-16,5
"Diamond member, room good. Lounge for diamond member great views. Parking is way over priced and a rip off, suggest you self park after dropping your bags at curb. Attentive and very cordial staff....",21-Sep-16,3
"I arrived around 1:00 pm on a Friday afternoon. I was told my room was not ready, which was fine since I was checking in early. I went and did some exploring around the area and waited for the call that my room was ready. I came back at 7:00pm. My room was still not ready. The gentleman checking me in said the hotel was at full capacity so he would have to see what he could do. He did find a room for me after some searching. I do not know who dropped the ball on not cleaning the room, but if every room was booked, there should not be any dirty rooms. The hotel is located in a great area. There are plenty of shopping and restaurants. The employees in the lounge and valet were very nice. The rooms have nice views.",20-Sep-16,4
We were very well cared for from the moment we stepped in the door....My wife is ceoliac and the staff in the Grand Room catered to her exceptionally....the grand room is great value look into this ,20-Sep-16,5
"It's was very nice to stay at this hotel with nice person , good help by the ""conciergerie"" people, also nice person to served on the breakfast , the place of the hotel is very closed to the central of the city , very closed of the public transportation to visiting all the big city",20-Sep-16,3
"From start to finish, our stay for our 15th anniversary was delightful. Only tricky part is the limited pull up area at arrival. Recommend you get familiar with the one way street layout in the area before you arrive if you are driving.",19-Sep-16,5
"My mother and I just returned home from San Fran. Stayed at the Grand Hyatt. Convenient location, clean hotel, beautiful views, courteous staff. Will definitely stay there again when we go back for a return vacation. ",18-Sep-16,5
"We had a city-view room, it was spectacular, though it you're staying here spend the extra money for the bay-view. I saw it from the 36th floor and it is absolutely amazing. Room was great, clean, and quiet. Gym is very nice and has great views also.",18-Sep-16,5
"The staff here is wonderful. The construction noise at night, on union square is obnoxious. There is a long term tunnel project that works 24/7. If you are a very very heavy sleeper you will be fine. If note don't get a room overlooking union Square. ",16-Sep-16,4
"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful stay here while vacationing this summer. We are Hyatt Loyalists and this Grand Hyatt did not disappoint. We had some points to burn so we booked 3 nights in a Club Room and it was worth it. The room was modern and had great ambience (love the automated lighting settings) and of course, the views were amazing. The high floor (32nd) was definitely the way to go and the Club Lounge had a nice selection of breakfast items that appealed to the whole family. Although we only made it for one evening snack, it was great to have that option- especially with a tired toddler who makes a walk down the block a little less attractive.Since we left Brooklyn in a hurry to catch our plane out West, I was sad to realize that I had left a few much-needed items at home. One of the best thing about the new Hyatts is that this is not a problem since they give you an easy menu to fill out where you can access free amenities by simply calling hospitality. It was a life saver! On several occasions, we had friendly employees sent to our room with a bag of complimentary replacement items.The valet crew was great as well, although it's one of the more expensive valet services we've used, they are prompt and professional and made our trip hassle-free. Overall I heartily recommend this hotel. We would not hesitate to stay here again!",16-Sep-16,5
"I have been to Bay Area 6 times over last few years and this is the pick of the bunch.I used the iPhone service to check in so I got off the plane and turned my phone on to tell me my room was ready - I went directly to the room no reception no waiting - perfect.Rooms are great size, modern and clean - but of street noise from 14th floor but hey better then most places around here.When I had a couple of issues the staff bent over backwards to fix my issues and made my stay a real pleasure.I will be back here next time ",15-Sep-16,4
"From the Grand Hyatt, we walked across Golden Gate to Sausalito, through Golden Gate park to Sutro Pools and Cliff House. Great hotel to stay. We will stay here next trip for sure. Great attention from staff.",15-Sep-16,5
"We stayed 4 nights in an executive suite. The room was great with floor to ceiling windows, a master bedroom with walk-in shower and a separate living room and second bathroom with a tub. The staff in the the Grand club were great and accommodating when we were late for breakfast one day. The lounge on the second floor was fun, good drinks and ""amusing"" live music. Location is also great. Don't miss hops and hominy up the street for dinner. ",14-Sep-16,5
"I'm a luxury traveler; therefore, I have high standards and expectations. I have stayed in this hotel once while on business trip in San Fran. This is good hotel for the value. It has a good location.Rooms: very clean.Food: I ate at the restaurant downstairs only once and it was very good.Service: Very good.Overall: I think this hotel is worth its money and continues to improve itself.",14-Sep-16,4
"The rooms were very nice, beds comfortable with a good sized bathroom. Rooms come with a small refrigerator and a safe. There are nicely decorated, but could use more light (like almost every hotel I've ever stayed in!). Be sure to book or upgrade to a Grand Club level room, it really makes a difference in your stay. The Grand Club (on the 32nd floor) offers a continental breakfast (with eggs, sides, oatmeal and more pastries than you can think about eating) every morning. The room is open all day with light snacks, waters, juice, sodas and coffee. Then in the evening, they bring out the hors devours that are enough to make a meal on and the full self service honor bar. Drinks are only $3 for beer/wine and $4 for mixed or hard drinks (great deal, especially compared to the OneUP bar downstairs - which is a nice bar, by the way, but you do pay full San Francisco prices for the drinks! The bar usually has music nightly).The staff was nice and accommodating, despite it being a very busy holiday weekend. The hotel is downtown, so expect some of the 'local riff raff', but the hotel staff is good about keeping them away from in front of the hotel.",14-Sep-16,4
"Perfect location. Close to all shops, bus stops, and cable car stops. Had an easy and smooth early check-in process. The rooms are very modern and clean. The staff was very friendly. I would stay here again.",14-Sep-16,5
"I love San Francisco and have visited there a few times but the downtown area is now a punishment for the less informed city tourists as well as the soulless residents of the streets...Still, if you have a busy schedule then this hotel is centrally located (at least safer than the pier area) for the remaining attractions around town. Room- clean, modern and well kept for it is a Hyatt.Features:Big plus for the electric black-out shade.The bedside telephone/alarm/mini music player featured an iPhone 3 charging socket (a foresight at the time) with 2 USB sockets.Bedside lamps: I would prefer if I didn't have to fumble for the switch hidden in their lampshades, a contrast to other modern features in the room.Shower head is detachable (nice) but like most US hotels (homes), the water pressure is fixed (not very strong either) and only temperature is adjustable(boiling if not careful).Service - check in/out at noon was slow and guests had to line up in the middle of the narrow hallway, blocking all traffic in the lobby while staff was busy talking and running amongst themselves. One can't help to wonder why the retail in San Francisco is suffering, it can't all because of the internet.Did online booking kill good service?",13-Sep-16,4
"Lobby- slow, understaffed and disorganised for such regular process. Everyone was talking while the queue got longer and longer.Room- modern, well keptArea- San Francisco downtown is rough and smelly. You need good friends to cross the streets.",13-Sep-16,4
Very loud elevator noise. Shower sprayer was broken. Maid service never changed pillowcases; there was hair left on the pillows. AC temperature gauge didnâ€™t work properly as temperature would drop in the middle of the night.,13-Sep-16,2
"This hotel has a great location as it's right on Union Square within walking distance of lots of shops, bars and restaurants. All of the tour bus companies have pick up points at Union Square and the cable cars run right behind it. The hotel itself is very clean and the staff helpful. The room we had was on the 24th floor with a great view due to the floor to ceiling windows. It was quite spacious with a big comfy bed and wide screen TV. The bathroom was fairly small - the bath was too small to lie down in and I am only 5ft 5! There is a small fridge that you can have re-stocked with complimentary bottled water. However, there was no mini bar which was strange. The maid always left the room spotless. However, there were a few things that let it down. There were lots of towels (more than we knew what to do with) but no towel rails or bars on which to hang them to dry off. There were 2 bathrobe hooks that we tried to hang 2 off of, but the lack of towel rails meant the towels never dried properly as you had to re-fold them whilst wet - not great when you wanted a shower later that day/night. The bathroom had a slide door. However, it wouldn't go completely across so left about and inch and a half gap - not great when people are using the toilet! The shower wasn't powerful enough either. The biggest let down for me was the noise. The walls are paper thin so you can hear everything in the room next to you. Also, you could hear the constant noise from the lifts going up and down - which in a busy hotel is constant. A shame really as this would prevent me from going back.",13-Sep-16,3
"We stayed for four nights. The idea was to relax and acclimatise in a good quality hotel after the long journey from England. In many ways we were not disappointed.The Grand Hyatt is very well located on Union Square and is a perfect base to explore the city. Our room overlooked the square and we had a great view. We were fortunate enough to access the Grand Club Lounge for breakfast and for snacks during the day. The lounge is to be recommended if your budget allows, we enjoyed it apart from one morning when we arrived for breakfast later than normal (around 9 am) and it was a challenge to find a seat and table. I enjoyed, maybe too much, sitting at the cocktail bar and we had a decent dinner in the OneUp restaurant. But all was not well with our stay at the Grand Hyatt. I had originally reserved a Grand Club 2 double bedroom for our family of four. A couple of weeks before our arrival I received an email offering an upgrade to an executive suite for a reasonable price. I thought this would be a treat for the family and bit of extra space and privacy was desirable. So I proceeded to accept the upgrade. On arrival we were surprised to learn that our upgraded room, although very nice and clean, had just one king bed and a rollaway single. This meant that one of my sons had to sleep on the sofa, wrapped up in a robe on the first night because they failed to supply the extra bedding we requested (and we were too tired to argue after a very long day travelling). I mentioned our problem at reception the next day. Apparently, it was all about â€œpersonal choiceâ€ù and some guests prefer to have more space. I suggested that any guest their right mind is unlikely to choose fewer beds than they have people, but there was no satisfactory solution forthcoming from the hotel.Honestly, this didnâ€™t spoil our time in San Francisco, but it is a shame that the hotel would offer an upgrade that was so obviously inappropriate. If you find yourself in a similar position, do check more carefully than I did that an upgraded room is actually suitable for your needs.When we returned to the UK I completed a survey at the request of the hotel and subsequently received a pleasant email apologising for the mix up. Apparently this is a corporate issue and beyond the control of individual hotels. Just to prove what a corporate shambles Hyatt can be, I received a further email, almost a month after we checked out, confirming my upgrade â€“ â€œWe are happy to confirm your request to upgrade to an Executive Suite for your upcoming stay.â€ùI paid too much money to rate this overall hotel experience anything better than â€œAverageâ€ù.",13-Sep-16,3
"The hotel is situated right beside Union Square. It is a great central location. Rooms are spacious and equipped with all necessities. Breakfast is quite simple, but enough to fill you. No pools, just a gym but with a nice view of San Francisco.",13-Sep-16,4
"Well located hotel, nice lobby and common areas. My room was a little tired looking -nicked up cabinets and a loud mini-fridge with no mini-bar stocked in the room. I might not have had a fully renovated room. Weekday rate was much higher than weekend rate, so it was overpriced then okay in terms of value. Location is great, though all the one-ways to get to the hotel is a little inefficient - but easy to get places on Uber or by taxi.",12-Sep-16,3
"The staff was very responsive, rooms were clean, set-up for presentations and panels was good. As a business destination, the Grand Hyatt worked. My only complaint was the constant construction around Union Square. This is not a reflection on the hotel as a business destination but I could see it hampering the enjoyment of a vacation stay to have an afternoon nap be disturbed by jack-hammering.",12-Sep-16,4
"We just stayed at the Grand Hyatt and it was an exceptional experience. Big/Spacious rooms, excellent views, friendly/courteous staff at the front door, check in, concierge, and housekeeping staff .. Overall, an excellent stay,",12-Sep-16,5
"From the beginning, the SF Grand Hyatt turned what started off from a glorious wedding ceremony at the SF City Hall to a disasterous Wedding Day. First, the hotel didn't hold a particular type of room I was assured was being held for my daughter and her guests. I was made to feel foolish waiting 30 minutes for the Front Desk to tell me they did not hold the room that was supposed to be a surprise for my daughter. Then my daughter, her wife and wedding party and guests went to the hotel's restaurant to have dinner. They were met by one of their waitstaff who without cause had an attitude with them and seated them apart from the rest of the other diners in the restaurant. My dsughter and her guests then had to wait for over 45 minutes to even have bread brought to their table. By the time their food had arrived, it was cold and unappealing. And to top it all off the waiter broke a glass of soda that spilled all over my daughter in law's new cell phone. The waiter didn't even clean up the mess that was made by him. He just dropped off some towels to have my daughter and her guests clean up the broken glass and spilled soda. Needless to say, my daughter is heartbroken as to the poor and disgraceful service she, her wife and their guests received. The SF Grand Hyatt ruined my daughter's special day. One that cannot be replaced. If you are from the LGBT community and you are thinking about holding your special occassion at this hotel, you should seriously think about going to another Hyatt or another hotel.",11-Sep-16,1
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco from September 7-10, 2016 for a 3 night stay. I was there for a convention/conference. The group rate was $259 per night, valet parking is $67 per night, not including taxes and assessments. The room was a 1 king bed on the 5th floor. The mattress was comfortable and didnâ€™t show any signs of infestation. There are plenty of electrical outlets on both sides of the bed and desk area for charging any devices. Iâ€™m a Hyatt Gold passport member and I was able to use my iPhone as my room key, pretty cool stuff. The room overall is definitely modern and I enjoyed it. The Grand Hyatt is about a 15 minute walk to the Moscone Center for conventions. Iâ€™m sure the room rate would be much higher if I didnâ€™t have the group rate, and even then my employer paid for the room. Iâ€™ve posted several pictures for review. Iâ€™d definitely recommend this hotel for business or pleasure!",11-Sep-16,5
"Perfect location - just off Union Square. Great shopping, and walking distance to just about everything. Courteous, helpful staff. Clean, comfortable, modern rooms with nice beds and roomy bathrooms. The spurge for the Grand Club is worth every penny: the breakfast is divine, and it was very nice for a coffee/tea break during the day in the lounge with beautiful views of the bay. Very happy stay.",10-Sep-16,5
"I have made many trips to SF and this is the only hotel I will stay at. The rooms are always clean and just went under a complete renovation. The views are wonderful. It is perfectly located on Union Square with access to everything. The staff is wonderful and I can never say enough about them. Check in and check out are flawless, painless and doesn't take forever. I highly recommend spending the few extra dollars to get club access. Food is great, coffee superb, drinks are cheap and the staff up there is the best of the best. Plus it provides one of the most amazing views of the city. Only downside is wishing they had more window tables. I mean it when I say that for me this is THE sf hotel. Thank you for yet another perfect stay!!! You continually earn my loyalty. ",10-Sep-16,5
"Being a Hyatt lifetime diamond, I had never stayed here. Must say, not a bad spot. Given a room on 33 with a great view, club on 32 gym on 35.Check in a breeze, staff friendly.Downside. My bed squeaked on the right side, frame or something really annoying.Hotel supplies ear plugs, what does that tell you?I didn't need them, but I understand why, it's a little windy up here, and it has a sliding door that doesn't quite lock shut.Otherwise, I didn't mind it personally. A good stay overall",10-Sep-16,4
I seldom write a review... But my stay at Grand Hyatt is worth the time... Had a great time and enjoyed our stay. Great location-- in the heart of Uniion Square. Staff are all very nice and helpful. Self parking is also across the street. ,10-Sep-16,5
"We stayed at this hotel for 4 days while during Thanksgiving 2015. The hotel is centrally located in Union Square and just a few blocks from Chinatown. There are tons of shopping all around and a lot of good food and dining options. I think we had a standard room and it was very clean but the rooms were on the smaller side. Seemed like it would be a perfect stay for a business traveler but for a family of 4 (two small kids) it was fine enough. I thought the staff was very friendly and every time we left and came back to the hotel, we were always greeted with a warm smile especially staff by the front door. Very helpful and patient with questions on the surrounding area and directions. Would recommend and stay again.",9-Sep-16,4

"Honestly, it is a very good hotel. It is clean and well maintained. Very good facilities and a nice gym. The breakfast is great but $30 is a bit expensive. I wanted to stay longer had I have booked in advance. ",8-Sep-16,4
"Stayed here for 6 nights and it was just awesome. Check in and check out were the easiest, rooms well maintained and amazing facility. For a view of the city, bay and other views, go to the 36th floor and don't forget your camera :-).",8-Sep-16,5
"The location of this hotel is great - a few steps from Union square and China Town, loads of shops near by and only a short walk to SFMOMA and about 15/20 minutes to the waterfront. It's also convenient for the BART, trams and busses - even for the cable car, should you want to wait in line!Public areas are attractive too - particularly given how large and busy the hotel is. Check in/out staff are friendly but a little incompetent (they don't seem to understand how the Hyatt passport works).Rooms are pretty decent too - typical Hyatt; quiet colours, sleek furniture and comfortable beds.House keeping in the public areas could have been better (but was good in the rooms) and there is something of a lift problem - you can wait ages to get one! One of the best things was breakfast - the buffet was really good value at about $25 and the food was very tasty. The gym has great views but the room is old and unattractive - this really does need a makeover.All in all - a decent hotel in a great location.",8-Sep-16,4
"We were so disappointed with this hotel.The location is excellent but it ends there. No help with luggage, room grubby, stood in inches of water in the bath when showering. The air conditioning is pre set, no chance of personal needs.The room had a connecting door and you could hear the conversations of the people in the adjoining room.Street noise was unbelievable, music from a concert each evening in union square, voices in the street, and noise from nearby construction. The lifts were not cleaned for days, fluff, hair and really dirty.",7-Sep-16,2
 Excellent love the way they setup the room for my baby..! From the restroom to the crib excellent was equipped with the baby stuff.. I love the fact that they had to do the water Didn't need to buy any..,7-Sep-16,5
Perfect holiday weekend to be in SF. The Grand Hyatt was amazing and I highly reommend it. Only thing was my request for connecting rooms were not accomplished. They we in high demand. The weekend weather was spectacular so the views from the hotel was gorgeous!,7-Sep-16,5
"Beautifully renovated hotel right on Union Square, convenient to all. No parking on premises (valet car or park across street). Rates competitive with expensive SF, high government taxes add 20% to your stay.",7-Sep-16,5
"Choosing to stay at the Grand Hyatt San Fran was not a decision I made easily. My hotel criteria were as follows: Must be in Union Square, Must have a fitness center, Must have easy access to ALL public transportation, Service must be above a 4, Must have a restaurant on site, Room must be above a 4, and the overall rating must be above a 4. The Grand Hyatt turned out to be amongst the top 5 based on my criteria, so decided to give it a go. So glad I did. Amongst the other not so top of my list was 24hour front desk, and luggage storage. My only qualm was with the check in process. Because I booked with a third party (I know better next time) I did not receive my points for my stay which sucks! Also, my charges for my upgrades did not reflect on the third party site, so I totally forgot I even had that portion. All in all, that part wasn't a big deal, I just know better for next time. ",6-Sep-16,4
I stayed here for a conference overnight and wished I stayed longer. I was not aware of this hotel in downtown San Fransisco and got upgraded to a suite which was phenomenal. I would stay here every time I visit if I could afford it. Great place to stay!,6-Sep-16,5
The front desk is very helpful and treated me as if I was the most important guest they saw that day. I stay a lot of hotels but having that feeling that I was important despite many people probably spending more money there than me made it a worthwhile experience.,6-Sep-16,5
"In for a visit. The staff is extremely nice and accommodating. The room is beautiful and well-stocked with amenities. The bed and the pillows were great. Like virtually all other hotels, they have a ""green"" policy. I thought it was a little weird when we hung two of our towels up and they added an extra two towels to the room. We look forward to coming back the next time we're in town. ",6-Sep-16,5
"Clean, stylish rooms and lobby. The hotel is in a great location to Union Square. The views were excellent from higher floors. Staff were all pleasant, helpful and quick to assist. The restaurant food and service was good. Bar is quant.",6-Sep-16,4

"This is a good hotel for SF , but certainly not the greatest Grand Hyatt in the world...rooms can be improved upon .Room service is limited and slow . Functional clean , and a new apple store next door.",2-Sep-16,4
"We stayed here for just one night. Check in was fast and the doormen were friendly. The room had a great view of the bay, but it was very loud. We were on the 24th floor. In the morning before we left we noticed a seal was broken on the window, which may have contributed to the noise. Breakfast in the restaurant was good. ",1-Sep-16,3
"I love this hotel, it is in a brilliant location within two blocks of all the shops around Union Square. It feels safe and secure as I am travelling solo this is always important. Staff were friendly and accommodating with my late check out request. Room service was quick and the food was good. The rooms are spacious, modern, quiet and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable with multiple pillows to choose from.",1-Sep-16,5
it's 1:58am and the construction noise going on right outside the hotel is unreal. If you want to be able to sleep then stay somewhere else! The hotel are apologetic but they say there isn't much they can do. There are different projects going on that have 24 hr permits to work.,1-Sep-16,1
"Have stayed at this hotel before and had a much better experience. They seem to have changed the in room thermostat and now it can't be lowered below 65F (this one is hack proof). You may think that in SF air conditioning is not needed, but you would be wrong. Three times we called to have the thermostat lowered to 60F and every time, twice by the person that went to the room, we were told it could not be done, the exact words were ""it's impossible"". We had a room facing west so it got very hot in that room. At night we tried opening the windows the sliver that can be open but the only thing that we accomplished was a very very noisy night since all the buildings act as an echo chamber and sirens are going off all thru the night. And the room was still warm. We were also told by the engineer that the hotel turns the cooling water off at night to save energy. It was a very uncomfortable 3 night stay. If you like to sleep in a cool room avoid this hotel. The club room was small and every morning had problems finding a chair to eat breakfast. Very limited selection also. Paid over 1K for 3 night stay, too much, but maybe the price is linked to how warm it gets in the room, the warmer the pricier. Would not stay here again.",30-Aug-16,2
Check in was a breeze. Everyone friendly and eager to please! Had corner room on high floor. Nice setup with lots of room and bed was very comfortable. Free WIFI is a plusIn the morning coffee with snacks available for a fee in lobby. Better choice would be free coffee in lobby 'cause coffee maker in room is subpar,30-Aug-16,4
The hotel was very clean and the Staff was helpful and friendly. It is next to Union Square which is the center of much activity and shopping. Meeting facilites were good. I did not eat there so cannot comment on the food. I would stay there again.,30-Aug-16,5
The entire staff was excellent. The restaurant food was good and service even better. Hotel was clean and modern. The rates are pricey but not out of the range for the location which can't be beat. We'll definitely be returning whenever we make the trip to San Francisco.,30-Aug-16,5
"Family of 4 (2 kids ages 12 & 14) stayed for 4 nights in mid-August. We booked a double/double since we were in SF to see the sights and didn't plan on spending much time in our room. Don't be fooled, these rooms are small for 4 people. There isn't much room to put clothes if you want to unpack your suitcase. We had a dresser in the closet, which had 3 shallow drawers. What looks like a dresser under the TV, is really the safe and refrigerator (which was a plus.) The bathroom was larger than expected and had a really cool sink, but it took up too much valuable counter space. The bathroom also has a sliding door rather than a regular door that closes. I don't really get this. We had this same experience at a Hyatt in Boston. Do the folks who design these rooms travel with other people?? We picked Union Square because of its central location, but admittedly did a lot of traveling to get to Fisherman's Wharf everyday for the tourist attractions. In the morning we would take the bus ($2.25 per adult & $1 per child) and then usually walked back or once we took the cable car which can drop you off a block way. I have no complaints about the hotel, just wish the rooms were a little more spacious. I would stay here again rather than closer to Fishermans' Wharf, because I didn't think the quality of the hotels are better and I enjoyed walking through the different SF neighborhoods.BTW...the men and women working at the Concierge desk could not be more helpful to folks stopping by needing assistance.",29-Aug-16,4
"When I walked into our room, the view of San Francisco overlooking Union Square took my breath away. It was spectacular!!! The location of this property is about as central as possible. The room was incredibly spacious with a lovely dressing room and good sized bathroom. Our business is in major projects, so we naturally assess the quality of building construction and finishes. As good as this property looks, they haven't used as high quality finishes as we've seen in the other Grand Hyatt properties. But it's still a lovely hotel. We didn't eat at all in the hotel so I can't comment on the food offerings. The lobby has unusual artwork and working fireplaces - both lovely features. One great thing: the A/C was making noise our first night. We rang in the morning and they sent someone to assess it immediately. This person left to get a repairman with the correct parts and we went out. When I got back to the room, I was on my cellphone and the repairman was working. He finished working as I finished my call. He demonstrated how the A/C was now quiet and he apologetically asked me to give him my room key so he could ensure that I was the proper guest of the room. I was thrilled that he was that conscientious about security!!! I told the front desk the next morning to make sure that this repairman was recognised for his commitment to the well-being of the hotel's guests.I would definitely stay at this property again.",28-Aug-16,4
"Traveling to SF for business, I'm always trying to find a hotel that has a nice gym. The Grand Hyatt in SF had that as the gym itself had a half dozen treadmills, 3 or 4 elliptical machines, free weights, and a number of universal equipment. Located on the 35th floor, you get a pretty view of SF as well.The room itself was also very nice and I seemed to be quiet enough; only once did or twice did I hear some late night arrivals getting to their rooms. The room was a bit pricey, but you are in the heart of SF and luckily I could expense it for work. If the price would come down, I would definitely look to stay again.",28-Aug-16,4
"Wonderful hotel with modern rooms, great views, beautiful lobby, great breakfast buffet and fantastic service. On top of all that, it's located right in the heart of the city. Lots of great restaurants around, tour buses are next door as well as famous cable car stop. No complaints whatsoever. Highly recommend!",28-Aug-16,5
"I stayed at this property with a few friends while we were in town to run the San Francisco marathon. The hotel is bright, clean and nicely renovated. From a frequent traveler standpoint, the rooms are small and have tiny double beds if you're staying in a room with two beds. Our room was booked under my friend who is a Lifetime Diamond member with Hyatt - no upgrade. Also the Grand Club was flooded with families so it wasn't a ""peaceful business lounge experience"" if you're trying to get some work done. When I say flooded, we couldn't even sit down at a table as were forced to eat and stand during breakfast everyday. One nice feature is that the windows open up entirely with great city views on higher floors. From a safety stand point you are able to jump from the window if you choose (might not be the best feature with children).Service at the hotel was friendly and responsive for a large busy hotel. When I used to work in the city for extended periods of time I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton on Stockton - the service at the Hyatt was significantly better.I would definitely recommend this hotel, however if you like to take an after work swim look elsewhere because this hotel is strangely missing a pool.",27-Aug-16,4
"Pros:Centrally located in union square which makes dining and shopping very convenient.Walking distance to Nob Hill, Chinatown and Financial District.Room is clean, decent size (our assigned room is facing the street on the top level so we had a great view).If you forget any toiletries at home, just give them a call and they'll bring it to you within minutes. They even have a list of products in the room (hair spray, makeup remover, shoe horn, shaving cream, ~just to name a view~).Free wi-fi and the connection is very good.Staffs are friendly and welcoming (from receptionist to room service to bellboy).Btw, if you are a TV addict, feel free to bring your appletv. You can easily connect it to their tv with hdmi cable and all you have to do is to call the front desk for hotel's Internet provider info, call the number and they'll help connect the wifi to your appletv within couple minutes. Just remember to tell them how long you are going to stay there for.Cons:None!!! (SF is a pretty expensive city so union square area's hotel's price is high, just expect there, otherwise, it's a great pleasure staying here)",27-Aug-16,5
"Great hotel, fantastic views of the San fransico area, and all around amazing friendly staff! We celebrated our anniversary here and had a wonderful time! Can't say enough great things about this hotel ! ",27-Aug-16,5
"stayed 2 nights with great view of Union Square, very convenient next to Apple store and near Bart. Many restaurant choices. very comfortable beds and friendly service. Room spotless and modern. Will come back",27-Aug-16,5
"It's been said before - but one of the best things about this hotel is the location - it is really central and convenient to many places. Easy walk to the BART (train/subway), close to many shops, Union Square (obviously), and not a difficult walk to either the Ferry terminal or Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The hotel is good - good views and well-appointed room - very comfortable. I would stay again.",25-Aug-16,5
Hotel is everything you would expect from a modern Grand Hyatt. Being a central hotel the rooms are comfortable rather than spacious but the design is elegant and all the essential features are present for a business traveller.Staff are welcoming and the public areas are very comfortable. There are some impressive views from the upper floors.The location is great for shopping but the harbour or Golden Gate Bridge are only a short Uber ride away. ,25-Aug-16,5
"We stayed here for 3 nights at the start of our California trip. We had a room with 2 queen beds which was spacious enough for the four of us. We were on the 27th floor with a great view overlooking Union Square. There is still some building work going on, but there was no issue with noise at all.We made use of the hop on hop off buses which stop close by. This let us see the main sights of the city in a short time. The hotel is well located with lots of fabulous shops nearby and plenty of good restaurants to choose from. We didn't eat in the hotel, but had evening drinks in the bar which was lovely.The hotel has a well equipped gym with stunning views over the city from the 35th floor. My sons made use of this each day. We were glad we didn't have a car at this point as the San Francisco traffic is heavy. We picked up our hire car on the morning we were leaving for Yosemite which was perfect.If you are looking for a modern central hotel then the Grand Hyatt fits the bill.",25-Aug-16,4
Excellent location - east to get to all attractions. Very comfortable hotel. Great staff. Gym was well equipped. Fantastic view from 30th floor bedroom - worth paying extra for. Would definitely stay here again,25-Aug-16,5
"The location is perfect in Union Sq - shopping, restaurants, China Town, transportation. The service was impeccable from the moment we arrived. We had special requests which were accommodated seamlessly. The club perks were a wonderful upgrade that I will always look to include when I stay at a Hyatt from now on. They included breakfast as well as wonderful coffee selections and a great happy hour stop-in with excellent city views from the 32nd floor. They also had dessert and beverages. The hotel bar had great ambiance and live music. The room was perfect. I would definitely stay here the next time in SF!!",24-Aug-16,5
Service and room were really nice. Rooms have been updated recently and were very clean though modestly dated. The location in Union Square was super convenient and close to everything. The staff was very friendly and courteous as well. ,24-Aug-16,4
Great downtown location. Lounge upgrade was worth the extra money. Very good staff. Nice room with good amenities. Great view. Wifi weak in rooms. Couldn't watch movies without buying a package. Reasonable walking distance to most things. ,24-Aug-16,4
Good workout facility and small plates in the restaurant are stellar. A co-worker wanted grilled cheese and tomato soup and those were on the menu! The choose 3-4-5 is a great idea. Service was excellent.,24-Aug-16,5
Beautifully maintained hotel. Very luxurious. Best deal in town and in the square. Food was amazing. Check in and out quick and painless. Staff was friendly and courteous. Rooms were very nice. Would stay there again. ,24-Aug-16,5
Worst place to stay you 400 $ plus and still can't have a sound sleep It's a complete no ..........................................never ever again what a waste It's my first day and I am booked for 3 nights lets c what's in store for me,24-Aug-16,1
"Planned a quick trip to San Francisco so visit some favorite spots, tour the new SF Museum of Modern Art and visit some friends. Mid-August is the height of the summer tourist season, so I was delighted to find both availability and the points-and-cash option offered by the Hyatt Gold Passport program when I booked our room earlier this year. We knew we'd be in a comfortable property-- it has a AAA Four Diamond Rating. What we didn't realize until after arrival was the convenience of its location. The property is less than two blocks from Union Square. And it's just across the street from the popular 30-Stockton bus route, which takes one north to Chinatown, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf and the Marina District; or south to Market Street, BART connections and the transit terminal. We visit San Francisco at least once a year and have Clipper Cards to simplify riding and transferring between buses, light rail and the ferry system. Having the bus stops and the retail district of Union Square close by made getting around a breeze. We had a mid-level room with a city view. It was clean and well-maintained. Take the elevator to the fitness club on the 35th floor for some great views you won't enjoy in most workouts. And if there's no conference or event underway, go to the 36th floor for jaw-dropping panoramas of the city and the bay. There's a lot of new construction underway in the district that's slowly changing the face of the area and converting some of the neighborhood's rundown properties into upgraded businesses or high rises. You might hear a bit of construction noise during the daytime and at night but it wasn't very noticeable. We had lunch Saturday morning at OneUP, the second floor restaurant, and it while it was tremendously busy the staff gave us seats in the small private dining room off to the side where we had a tasty pair of straightforward entrees. I earn my Hyatt points at conferences and other stays around the country and this was an excellent place to combine them with some cash for an affordable room and a great couple's weekend. One other offbeat note: If you play PokÃ©mon Go, there are a couple of PokÃ© Stops close by and dozens of regular stops and ""lures"" within easy walking distance. That gives fans a chance to stroll and play or simply relax in the room after hours and reload their stock of PokÃ© Balls. Just sayin'.",23-Aug-16,4
"Outdated. To expensive for very little return. Ends don't justify means. Very loud , Food sucked, Tv was not great programming even worse. Staff was friendly, online concierge offered executive suite, then welched on what he offered, made me look foolish in front of friends. Kinda was refund if possible ",23-Aug-16,2
I won't stay anywhere else. Felt very special with the staff attention and the overall attentiveness of the staff. I loved the help we received as to any request we had.. A lovely g bunch of people. Location is very good. Rooms clean and quiet. But most of all it was the people who went our to their way to meet our needs.,23-Aug-16,5
"Overall my stay at the Hyatt in San Francisco wasn't bad. Very friendly accommodating front desk. The room was clean, bed was comfortable, unfortunately can't say the same about the city it's self. If i flew into San Francisco late. I would definitely stay there again. Price was right. Most importantly I didn't feel skeeved out staying in the room or sleeping in the bed as I did in some (over rated) hotels. Could there be a few minor upgrades? Of course! But definitely nothing that would alter my stay dramatically.",23-Aug-16,4
"This Hyatt is a relaxing respite from the bustle of Union Square. Within walking distance of shops and attractions, the hotel is quiet and comfortable. On the higher floors you have marvelous views and can't hear any traffic noises. The fitness center is spacious and well appointed. The Grand Club lounge on the 32nd floor is available to Hyatt Diamond Passport members - the buffet breakfast is fabulous! The bed is comfortable and the room is airy with large windows.",22-Aug-16,5
"If this was a budget hotel, Holiday Inn Express or similar, on half the price, I would rate it quite highly. But it is supposed to be a premier brand and has prices to demonstrate this. For this I only give it 3/5. On the plus side, the hotel is in a very central location. We upgraded to a 28th floor room which had great views over the city. It was comfortable enough and we had no major issues. On the minus side, we had a double double for two adults and a child and found it a bit snug (but it is a city hotel). The bathroom is also quite small. It had a design flaw in that the door to the bathroom had a large pane of glass in it and there was only one bright light in the bathroom. So if someone went to the bathroom in the night, they invariably lit up the whole bedroom. The biggest minus was the general lack of attentive service you might expect from a Hyatt. The doormen/porters were next to useless. Our taxi dropped us off from the airport with 3 suitcases. We were completely ignored by the doormen. We wheeled our suitcases to reception for check-in, expecting the receptionist to ask if we wanted a hand with our bags. Nothing doing, we took them to our room ourselves. Checking out, I went to get a hire car and my wife and daughter wheeled the 3 cases out to the sidewalk on their own. Again no offer to help. In fact the doormen frequently didn't even both to open the doors for us as we came and went. The concierge wasn't able to get us a table in a restaurant other than what was already listed on Open Table. I had always assumed they would have the contacts but not here. An app could completely replace them. We left a note for the maid asking for another shower cap (and left a tip). We came back to find our toiletries replaced but not shower cap. First World problems I know, but when you are paying hundreds of dollars a night, is it too much to expect the staff in a hotel to help you with your bags, find a restaurant table or replace an item in the bathroom? So if you want to stay near Union Square, I think there are a lot of other options which I'm guessing are going to be a bit better than the Hyatt. ",22-Aug-16,3
"I really don't like this hotel after the refurbishment, however the beds are very comfortable and the location is exceptional right next to union square. Now they have a huge Apple Store next door as well. The concierge was very good as we emailed before our arrival that we wanted phone cards which was promptly arranged for us. The service overall was good and the view from the lounge is spectacular. Also the price is very reasonable compared to similar hotels in Sfo.",22-Aug-16,4
"We spent the weekend for our anniversary. The staff was so amazing, they offered strawberries and chocolate to celebrate! They also granted my request for a late checkout because I am pregnant and wanted to take a quick nap before leaving. Great location and staff, and clean room. Would stay again.",22-Aug-16,5
"Great location close to Union Square, shopping, BART station, and many great restaurants. We got a room on a higher floor (25th Floor) with a great view of Union Square and the entire city. Check in was smooth and they even comped us 2 cocktails at the bar on the second floor. Conceirage was also helpful in recommending place to visit, easy ways to get around town-bus, bart, or uber/lyft.bartender Phil makes some tasty drinks",21-Aug-16,5
"Here for a weekend stay.The hotel doesn't look like much on the outside but the inside is totally updated and modern. It's right at the corner of Sutter and Stockton, which is 1.5 block NE of Union Square.Location: just out of the craziness on me Westside of the square. A lovely outdoor courtyard and fountain that overlooks the brand new Apple Store. A nice little oasis. Hotel valet is $60/day (crazy), park across the street at the Sutter garage for $25/day instead. Easy access to shopping on the square and to SFMOMA and other sights in SoMa. The hotel has a nice cutout on the curb to allow easy loading and unloading. Plenty of taxi and uber nearby.Room: we had a city view room. Floor to ceiling Windows and has sliver of bay view in between the buildings. Room is standard sized with king bed, club chair and ottoman, desk. Bathroom barely fits two people, shower only. The sink is the largest I've ever seen and looks outsized for the bathroom. But all updated and new. Nice bath amenities.Bed is a bit on the hard side but linens were nice and soft. Room has blackout curtains, which was nice. We were on the 30th floor, so no street noise. But have stayed at lower floors and can hear street noise and construction on Union Square.Had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend.",21-Aug-16,5
"Located in the center of the city of San Fransisco, near the most popular shops, restaurants and bars, the Grand Hayat Hotell provides excellent services, spacious rooms and very good breakfast and cuisine in general ! It is a very good combination of value, money and location. We will definatelly chose this hotel when we visit SF again!",21-Aug-16,5
"Stayed here for 6 nights. A little under whelmed by the hotel. Nothing really bad, but I expected a little more from a grand Hyatt. Neighborhood is very mixed with upscale shops and restaurants and homeless people. Rooms are a little small but adequate. Big useless bathroom sink. Little drawer space for 4 people. Warning!! Nearby Contruction goes 24 hours / day. Not the hotel's fault, but be aware a lot of street noise and construction noise around the clock. 14 floors up and still loud. The hotel was apologetic, offered a free breakfast and felt bad. It was beyond their control. Overall decent experience though. Good location plenty of places within walking distance. Cable cars and #30 bus can take you just about anywhere!",20-Aug-16,3
"Beautifully decorated suite with lovely furnishings, lovely living room area and the bedroom spacious and bathroom is big. The view from the suite floor of downtown San Francisco is breath taking. Bliss!",20-Aug-16,5
"I took a long time to book a hotel in San Francisco for the start of our holiday and the hotel didn't disappoint.Located in union square which is full of bars, shops and restaurants a nice place to get too and stay. Room was of a high standard and great views of the cityStaff were friendly",19-Aug-16,5
I was able to get my room from under $200 a night and stayed for three nights. The people there were very nice and the room was clean and well kept. Safety is an issue for the hotel and there was always someone watching the lobby and the elevator area. The hotel is centralized where shopping and restaurants are close by as well as China Town right around the corner. The hotel pricing is seasonal and there are times in the year that you can a great deal. Parking though was $40 for a twenty four hour period.,19-Aug-16,4
"I had stayed on 2 previous occasions due to business. This visit was personal and location was very convenient. I was very surprised by the remodeling of the hotel and there was definitely a different feel to the hotel. I was always comfortable staying there. However this time it felt like an indulgence because it was a personal trip and the remodeling and new check-in/check-out process made it feel like a whole new experience. I miss the top floor restaurant (had a nice breakfast). However the check-in and check-out process was far more efficient and much more progressive for the more quick paced, mobile generation.",19-Aug-16,5
"I have stayed in numerous hotels in San Francisco, and this is my favorite. It is small, easily traversable, has great service and rooms are never a surprise....except this visit! Hyatt has renovated the property, and I am amazed with the improvements. The rooms are peppier, modern, and they feel more expensive. We upgraded to a two room suite, and loved the City views, which were hidden from us with the touch of a button. (Shades going up or down) Bathroom lighting is a vast improvement over the standard fluorescent lighting which made anyone over 25 look horrendous. Lovely sinks, comfy furnishings, and intimate feel with a modern flair. Room service from a distance, via my cell phone. I did not want to leave! Remember, higher floors have less street noise!",19-Aug-16,5
Spent 4 nights here. Was a great location and everyone was friendly. Room was small for 4 people for sure but the view was great--we faced the square. Every morning we ran out of towels. They only provided 3 large ones! We left a note about that and also about coffee. They only left one regular everyday. When I called they brought more. I was underwhelmed by all that and also the restaurant. The food was ok. I paid $16 for a grey goose Cosmo. I thought that was a bit over the top. ,17-Aug-16,3
Excellent hotel and staff. All staff were very friendly. Rooms were spacious and laid out well; plenty of storage. Love the mattress; it was a great night's sleep. The refrigerator is always nice to keep food and beverages. They also had fruit water next to the ice machine.,17-Aug-16,5
The hotel staff was consistently friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean with a modern design and stunning city and bay views. I love the rainbow LOVE artwork in the courtyard outside and the stunning art installation in the lobby area. I enjoyed cozy lobby design with plush couches and cool library walls overlaid on glass to the alley - very cool :),16-Aug-16,5
"Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights for a conference. Having lived in San Francisco for many years, totally agreed that this hotel has a perfect location, close to all kinds of public transportation, within walking distance to shopping, dining, tourist attractions, Chinatown, and even a pleasant 20-min walk to Fishermanâ€™s Wharf. Knew that the hotel had a major renovation recently, so really have expectation to it. When first arrived at the hotel, everything looked fresh and new. Checked in was easy and the staff were OK (not specially friendly). But when you got inside the room, you would find that they were using budgeted materials for the renovations. The closet door couldnâ€™t be closed properly, the night stand was moving, the water pressure at the shower was weak, the mattresses were soft, and the frig was empty. The air-con was noisy so I decided to turn it off and opened the window (can be opened up to 5 inches) to let some fresh air in, I was on 20th floor but could still hear the traffic noise from the street all night. So you can choose which noise you wanna hear while you sleep. I booked this hotel with the conference package and it said â€œcity viewâ€ù, but donâ€™t expected to see the view from their website, it was the office building next door that you could see. Unless you pay extra for a higher floor with nice view of the Bay Bridge or Alcatraz, donâ€™t expect a nice view. Overall it is just an average hotel and I'll give it a 3.5 star only.",15-Aug-16,3
"We visited San Francisco for both a conference as well as some tourist-time. Grand Hyatt was perfectly located for easy walking to Union Square, Chinatown, Financial district, SFMuseum of Modern Art, shopping and dining. We enjoyed walking as well as the sightseeing bus that we caught from Union Square.",15-Aug-16,5
"Wowed away by the property and excellent service. The BF and I booked a 36 hour jam-packed trip to SF for a random getaway weekend from the heat in Denver. Right from the moment we arrived on property (car sharing service transportation), we were warmly greeted by every staff member. The guest services agent(s) promptly/efficiently assisted us with getting pre-checked in (as we arrived at 8 AM to stow our bags) and shot us a text once our room was ready. Very chic dÃ©cor and modern accommodations, very helpful information in the rooms of all services available, great amenities for any traveler, and the best sleep!!!!! We had breakfast at OneUp Restaurant and enjoyed our experience/food with Johnny (server) - highly recommend the Dungeness Crab Omelet over the buffet Location is prime: located off of Union Square, you are in the center of it all. Walking distance from pocket neighborhoods. Plan on staying during our trip in November.Thanks, Grand Hyatt, for the lovely service!",15-Aug-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt has a fun interior with very sleek & artsy designs. The staff is very knowledgable about the area and is really very helpful. One Up serves a great, simple breakfast. The size and design of the hotel rooms makes it very easy to feel at home.",15-Aug-16,5
"The team at this Hyatt was outstanding. They were very helpful, kind and knowledgeable!! The hotel is right next to Union Square and in the middle of a great shopping area. Also lots of restaurants to choose from.",15-Aug-16,5
"Though IÂ´ve been there for just a few days for vacations I must mention how wonderful Elaine from the concierge desk was. Always went out of her way to help me and answer all the questions I had and help me with the packages I had to received. Trully one of the bests!The hotel is really beatiful, well located and with trully care staff.",14-Aug-16,5
"work trip with a small time to walk the city a bit...and loved every minute of it...the city was quite cold for august, but i'm from texas and in texas it's HOT. beautiful town. the grand hyatt is located close to china town and union square and in walking distance to so many cool spots.",14-Aug-16,5
"The location of this hotel was perfect for our needs.It is 2 blocks away from the Powell Street bus station and literally sitting on Union Square, were most tour companies pick up from.There is a coffee cart open in the hotel in the morning, if not a Starbucks across the road. There are plenty of shopping opportunities (with Macy's on one block away) and plenty of places to eat.China Town is also close (technically one block diagonally away from the hotel).All staff were approachable, including check in staff, luggage store staff and the concierge desk.Will definitely stay at this hotel again when returning to SF.",14-Aug-16,5
"We came here to see a concert at AT&T Park and to take in some of the tourist sites. The Hotel was a wonderful place to stay located in Union Square and lots of shopping. All staff across the board were amazing and very attentive. Once there i was offered an upgrade to a more roomy Suite and I'm glad we took them up on it !! what a room. Huge Living room with dining table and separate kitchen area. The views in this room were amazing !!! City and Bay views !! The room also came with access to the ""Grand Club"" on the 32nd floor which offered a hospitality suite with drinks and appetizers and continental breakfast in a room with spectacular views. The bedroom was great and the bed was very comfortable. Great Stay, Great Location and walking distance to lots of restaurants, shopping and AT&T Park.",13-Aug-16,5
"The hotel is excellent overall, staff are friendly (except some at grand Club in the morning shifts). The reception and bill men were excellent and so much helpful. I would recommend this hotel for everyone who wants to be in the center of SF downtown. We did not need a car. we walked to all places",13-Aug-16,4
"Enjoyed the staff, and club level services. Double bed room was small for my family of four, but location near Union Square was great for shopping and restaurants, as well as very near China town. I would stay there again with my family next time I visit San Francisco.",12-Aug-16,5
"We loved this hotel. It was in a great location, right at Union Square with shopping and restaurants very close by. The hotel is beautiful and immaculately maintained. We had an amazing city view of the city and bay on the 28th floor. The beds were comfortable and we had nice bathroom amenities. When we arrived at our room it was a nice personal touch to see our names on the tv screen welcoming us. Juan who checked us in sent a cupcake and milk to our room to celebrate our 10 year old granddaughter's birthday. The concierge staff was warm and very helpful in recommending tours and restaurants. We had a rental car and we used the parking garage right across from the hotel with a 45.00 per day self assisted hotel rate with in and out privileges.It was billed directly to our room which made it very convenient. The bellmen outside the hotel were very nice and helpful as well. We loved this hotel and if we ever get back to San Francisco we will definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt.",11-Aug-16,5
"The beds were very uncomfortable. If you like being in a noisy, hustle, bustle area with LOTS of shopping and LOTS of crowds/people, then this is a good location. If you are trying to get rest (R&R) - forget about it. Average service, marginal food and service at restaurant. Very small work-out area. For a Grand Hyatt. this hotel did not measure-up.",11-Aug-16,3
"I travel every week to San Francisco for work. I've been looking for my go-to hotel, and this one isn't it. I also travel frequently to other places, and the Grand Hyatt San Francisco is more like a hotel in rural India or rural China than what I'd expect in a world-class city. Everything looks nice, but doesn't really function or work the way it should.My main complaint is that rooms are very noisy. You can hear everything going on in nearby rooms. A conversation 20 feet away in the elevator lobby. Someone urinating in their bathroom in the room next door or upstairs. The construction quality of the building itself seems to have skimped on some of the basic architectural techniques inside the walls and plumbing that would improve sound-proofing. I experience this most frequently in rural India and rural China where construction is fast and low-quality but looks nice on the surface.The service from the employees during my week-long stay was consistently good. I order room service breakfast every morning. The options are pretty limited for a large hotel, but sufficient. Sometimes the wait was long (40 min +). But the employees who took the order and brought the food were always very nice and very professional. Check in was also very easy, friendly with a smile.Overall, I'd say to avoid this hotel, mainly because the building itself was not constructed very well. You can tell by how easily sound travels. But the staff are great.",11-Aug-16,2
"I was in San Francisco for a business trip for 3 days and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights (although my booking was for 3 nights).The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is right next to union square. It is a touristy location, so it is busy throughout the day, there are many restaurants & shops around.The staff is not very friendly. I had some issues related to charging the bill & they made very little effort to solve the problem. I found the staff at the reception impatient. I was trying to get some local help and the concierge desk was always either busy or unattended. When I took a taxi, the bell boy ""helped"" me to hire a flat rate cab which turned out to be much more expensive - so beware!The room was okay. I was alone but they gave me a room with 2 small (twin) beds although I requested a double bed and didn't change it at checkin time. There are the usual amenities in the room: TV, fridge, coffee maker (this was inside a cupboard so I didn't see it the first day). There are very few electrical outlets, only 1 chair and very little space to move around. On the whole, I would say the room is manageable if one needs to stay for a few days.They had free wifi which worked well for me.Overall my stay was comfortable, but I would try & find a more business friendly hotel next time (free or even paid breakfast in the hotel would be nice, 24 hour coffee, printer, etc.).",10-Aug-16,3
"As is the case with other Grand Hyatts I've stayed in around the world, I have only good things to say about the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. Plenty of outlets located around the room. Modern, yet tasteful and comfortable decor. Large (and very cool looking) bathroom sink; plenty of counter space. Plenty of desk space for work. Very cool power shade cover for the window. Fantastic location in the heart of the city. I particularly liked the combination luggage stand/drawers in the closet -- it's very convenient. Upon check-in, I was given a voucher for complementary drinks and appetizers at the hotel lounge. (Thank you!)",10-Aug-16,5
"This was our first time staying at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. We came up for a staycation while our daughter went to Outside Lands. The location of the hotel is very convenient as it is 1 block from Union Square. We were surprised by the cost of overnight valet parking and $76!!! Found a couple good restaurants - one across the street at the Taj ( Indian cuisine) and the other is up one block, Bouce ( French Cuisine) reservations required at both but we got lucky!",10-Aug-16,4
"I stayed here for a week in July when travelling on business. The hotel is very centrally located, just next to Union Square and only a 5-10 minute walk down to Market Street, the Financial District and a bit further to the Ferry Terminal (South East) or Westfield (South West).I walked to most places (my offices were just down on Market) and an UBER will get you quickly anywhere further - e.g. Pier 39, AT&T Stadium area etc.Rooms were spacious and comfortable, with a soft bed, good work desk and a decent view of the city. To stretch those legs, there were good fitness facilities (with a great view on a high floor), though no pool. It's relatively more expensive for the price and is slightly more ""tired"" than other hotels under the same Grand Hyatt brand. I would rate it 4/5 rather than the usual 5/5. Service was as you'd expect for a hotel like the Grand Hyatt. My wife bought a bike one day and staff were extremely accommodating to put it in storage til the day we checked out.",10-Aug-16,4
"I was expecting so so very much more than what we received. The customer service was horrible, they did not care about us or show us that they valued our business. We arrived early and requested early check in, they forgot about us, they did not seem to care. We had arrived early after a 7 hour drive, cold, and a tired 1 year old. The king club felt like any standard room... The food presentations were a joke; bananas and cookies lol... I could go on and on.",10-Aug-16,1
"The rooms are very quiet despite being in such a central location. The last time I was in SF, my wife and I had to but ear plugs to sleep. The hotel is close to all the action (Union Square, Chinatown, etc.) in San Francisco. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I really have nothing bad to say about my stay. Highly recommended.",9-Aug-16,5
A bit of a pickle at check in was resolved to our satisfaction and our room had a great view.Very helpful staff - from the doormen to the cleaning staff in particular who always had a cheery greeting for us.We will return.,8-Aug-16,5
"Being in the Finacial district puts you smack dab in a location where the ferry is walking distance, cable and street cars are just outside the hotel and you can walk to so many wonderful attractions and neighborhoods. While there is no pool this place makes up for it by having a great restaurant and spectacular libby/atrium with well appointed fitness facilities. The hotel serves conference wonderfully. The rooms are well furnished and clean. Beds are comfortable. And the staff are very polite, professional, and friendly. There are other good hotels in the area but this one's location edges the other out. It's not the most cost effective place but you tend to pay for what you get. This is the main place I stay when traveling to the Bay Area.",8-Aug-16,4
We are staying here for 4 nights am disappointed in the hotel. First no security when it comes to getting to your room. Anyone can go to any floor. In this location you should only be able to get to your floor and the common areas of the hotel. Am surprised this hasn't been implemented. The rooms are ok nothing special for decor. Am surprised no night turn down. Coffee making facilities in the room but has coffee mate no real cream. WTH. No bar with a great view even tho there is a room they rent out for private party's on a high floor. I guess I have stayed in Grand Hyatt in The Middle East and SE Asia and they were on a different magnitude then this one. Not worth the money if you are going to pay this kind of money you should be getting the extras!!,8-Aug-16,2
"I travel to San Fran regularly work and this IS the hotel i would love to stay at all the time. I love the great views , the great rooms and most importantly the service !The club lounge on the 32nd floor has awesome views and great options for breakfast and evening snacks !I havent tried the gym yet as I get plenty of walking around the city, union square etc.. Great Location !The beds are quite cozy !I will always come back here.",8-Aug-16,5
"This is a great hotel that's, of course, in a great location. We went for the $50 ""Club"" upgrade and after a 4-night study we're glad we did so. It did help to have our room on the Club floor, 32. It's more than breakfast. There's a cool espresso machine, drinks and fruit that are available at all times we were there. Then, at 5, they set out a full ""honor bar,"" with a couple of red and white wines for $3 and ""make it yourself"" cocktails for $4. Until 7pm, they put out quite a spread. Vegetables, pickled vegetables, delicious cheeses and, one night, ""sliders,"" and another night a pasta dish. Breakfast is the usual pastries and fruits plus a delicious lox and bagels spread. There's oatmeal (good) and delicious scrambled eggs bPlus, there's that great espresso machine (and regular coffee too). We 'dinged' a star due to a weird housekeeping experience. Coming back to the room late one afternoon, we were surprised to find that the room hadn't been made up even though the towels had been replaced -- and out $5.00 tip picked up. It was too late and too much hassle to do anything about it. Especially odd because the day before (with an immaculately cleaned room) we were pleased with the nice thank-you note for our tip from housekeeping. Another sour note was the lack of capacity in the Clubroom. As other reviewers have accurately noted, at busy hours (either AM or PM) the place is overwhelmed with people milling around unable to find a place to sit. However, Clubroom staff are helpful and gracious, especially David. Based on our experience the $50 daily upgrade cost for the Club is well worth it. ",8-Aug-16,4
"would try another hotel on a future visit. Noting particularly special about (or wrong with) the hotel. The restaurant, One Up. was ok. My biggest pet peeve was that there was no place to hang a towel in the bathroom so you couldn't reuse a towel to save water even if you wanted to. The sink in the bathroom was trendy, but was too big for the counter space and resulted in not much space for toiletries.",8-Aug-16,3
Fantastic place to stay. I would go back to stay at this particular hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone for business or pleasure. Hopefully this review will help others choose your hotel for their stay. The bed was awesome and I slept very well. Everything was clean and well appointed.,8-Aug-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco meets the expectations one has for that brand: it is well run, clean and with high end service and attention to details. For example, for our party of three, my wife and I booked two room separately under our respective names. The hotel had the initiative to make the connection between the two reservation and give us adjoining rooms without being asked. The rooms (one with a king and one with two doubles) were clean and functional. Staff here was uniformly friendly and helpful. I also attended a conference here, and the facilities were more good (the conference rooms on the 36th floor have spectacular views). The location is also very good. The hotel is near Union Square and a short walk to Chinatown. The only negative is that the elevators are very slow.",7-Aug-16,5
"There was a lot of noise at times there shouldn't be any (I woke up at 6 in the morning with the sound of construction, but could only call asleep at around midnight because of said construction). Good rooms, although not very spacey. The breakfast was very diversified and very good overall.",6-Aug-16,4
"the spectacular renovation of the San Francisco Grand Hyatt--situated between Union Square and the business district--manages to combine the needs of a large business hotel with the feel of a boutique property. i hadn't visited since the makeover and was impressed with the cool, clean organized lobby and the professional, friendly staff. Six elevators guarantee a few seconds wait at most. We arrived early and our double double room wasn't ready. we walked around the corner for breakfast, strolled back and picked up keys to our good size room. Not much of a view but terrific, comfortable beds and well stocked bathroom. this may not be in the Ritz or Four Seasons category but within the chain properties a step below, this Hyatt stands out. ",6-Aug-16,5
"We stayed here with our family as our home base for touring San Francisco with our 15 and 10 year old daughters. Located half a block from Union Square, near Yerba Gardens, the entrance to Chinatown and near the hub of transportation. We took advantage of the streetcars, cable cars, busses and train all convenient to our hotel. Close to LOTS of shopping and plenty of dining. Starbucks just across the street for morning coffee. Plenty of nearby breakfast spots and great food. The hotel itself was comfortable and modern; the automatic window shades were a nice touch. Would stay here again.",6-Aug-16,4
One of the best experiences I have had at a hotel. The staff was incredibly helpful and courteous and the facilities were top notch. They offered us a discount on upgrading to a suite and our room was incredible.,6-Aug-16,5
"Location of this hotel is great. Check in / out speedy. Nice bar and hotel interior. Rooms are spacious and clean, the gym was ok. There are some great eateries nearby and easy walking distance to all the places in San Francisco. Good for a short stay! ",6-Aug-16,4
"Rooms, staff, location and amenities were great. A 5 minute walk to union square. I stayed here a few years ago before the remodel so was sad that the lounge at the top is no longer there but the new bar/lounge is great, the room was incredibly comfortable, the hotel was quiet, some street noise from time to time but it's a big city so that is expected. I would like to recognize the fantastic Ron at the front desk, great guy and started our trip off on the right note. Great customer service. Also Vanessa at the concierge was a wealth of knowledge and gave great suggestions, I think we did almost everything she recommended. Hope to stay here again on my next visit",6-Aug-16,5
"The hotel is situated right in the buzzing Union Square. The staff is very courteous. The breakfast is quite wholesome. The gym has a lot of machines and free weights to chose from, apart from the regular treadmills. If you end up staying here, don't miss the view from the 36th Floor. Overall a very good experience.",6-Aug-16,4
"I've stayed in SF before at the Hilton and this was a definite improvement even though it's a similar price. Rooms were spacious and comfortable, with modern decor (also throughout the hotel). I really liked as well the list of bits and pieces (toiletries etc.) that you could ask for if you'd forgotten things - a really nice touch. Staff were personal, friendly and helpful. Location is great - right on Union Square. Bar is a bit of an unfriendly space to spend much time in, but otherwise fine. OneUp was ok. Few issues with service the night we went and the food was ok rather than really good, but for price and convenience it's a good option. The menu had a nice selection as well, and the dishes generally were tasty (special call out for the burger). All in all, I'd recommend it, if it's in your budget. If I come back to SF on work again, this will definitely be my preference,",6-Aug-16,4
The dÃ©cor of the lobby was great. The room conditions are clean and furnishing very tastefully done. The staff are nice and the location is excellent. It is located right in the middle of the shopping district,5-Aug-16,5
"Paid big bucks for a Club room for two nights. We were put in a tiny standard room. When I questioned the room right after check in, I was told it is absolutely a club room. When I checked out and complained I was told I was not in a club room and that hotel management does this all the time.",5-Aug-16,1
"The hotel's staff were courteous and friendly. My room was asthetically pleasing, clean and the bed was surprisingly comfortable. The electronically controlled room darkening shades were a great touch. The premium Wi-fi was very reasonably priced. I'd definitely stay here again.",5-Aug-16,5
"If you are traveling for work, this is a great hotel to book, as it is in the center of downtown San Franciso and is accessible to all the dining and shopping you can handle. It is also close enough to the airport and to other areas you may be interested in touring. Overall, this was a good choice. The hotel is pricey, but you pay for the location.",5-Aug-16,4
"The hotel is located just at few steps away from Union Square with all the famous shops in walking distances. A Starbucks is right across the street, a Nike Store at the corner of the block.Powell St. Station/Cable Car is 5-10 min. walk around the corner.The rooms are modern but a bit tiny for 3 pax and five suitcases. The bathroom is new remodeled and luckily with a handshower - not like a usual ""american"" showerhead. Everything was cleanThe hotel has not a own garage/parking facility - there is one around the corner who is working with the hotel. It's about 45-67$ per day - really expensive but unfortunately quite ""normal"" for a big city like SF. Personally i missed a coffee maker or similliar to prepare a morning tea/coffee - on my opion it should be available in a hotel that pricy/category.We booked a double room for three nights. As a Gold Card Member i got the option to get an upgrade via mail. I did everything online but as we arrived we were told that they couldn't find anything about that upgrade. There wasn't any bayview rooms available for the first night but the employee said that we could move into the new room the next day - they will pick up our luggage in the morning and we could get our new keys in the afternoon.BUT surprise, surprise: as we returned back from sightseeing any bayview room was reserved for us and the same emplyee like the day before couldn't explain the circumstances... The guy who took care of us could be a bit more courteous. He offered us a little cash refund but due to the planed moving, no room maid came and clear/clean up the room. I didn't call for one because due to my health conditions i had to lay down after spending the whole day 'on the road'.It's not the first time that i have problems with that hotel chain and hopefully my bookings the next days in SoCal will be without any complains/problems.Beside these personal issues it's a good central hotel to stay with - a bit noisy because of traffic but you be close to a lot of sightseeing places.",4-Aug-16,2
"Beautiful hotel in great location. A gorgeous fire in the reception area was well appreciated at the end of a busy day. Close to shopping & Chinatown. A fair walk to the marina (25 minutes) with one steep hill to climb. The customer service is outstanding, from the doorman through to concierge. The rooms are very comfortable & spacious. The restaurant is small so there is a short wait for breakfast but the food is of a very high standard. We had lunch in the restaurant which I recommend doing, particularly the Crab Bisque. There is also a bar/lounge with a lovely atmosphere although the wine list was a little disappointing. Overall, a great stay.",4-Aug-16,5
"Reserved 2 beds - got a King. Was there for a marathon so really needed to rest and the rollaway isn't what I had in mind for $319/night. TV was OK but movies selection was awful and then didn't have any sound! Go back to basics - you have a great hotel, keep it simple. Restaurant is GREAT for breakfast.",4-Aug-16,4
"Good hotel , helpful staff in very good location for shopping and sightseeing.A walking distance from Chinatown and even marina is not so far away.A lot of shops and good restaurants around - ask the concierge service they are very helpful with all you need.",3-Aug-16,4
"My fiance and I just can't seem to stay away from SF. We got a great travel deal for flights to SF so decided to head up to the Bay for the weekend. The Grand Hyatt is centrally located for San Francisco. The hotel is modern, sleek and the rooms are really nice. We had a great time in SF and a great stay the the Grand Hyatt. Highlights:- Again, amazing staff. Very helpful and friendly. - Location is really great if you want to explore the city. Walking distance to a ton of things and just an Uber away from other parts of the city. - Bar is nice. We always like to hang out at the bar before we go up to our room. - Rooms are modern, sleek and clean. Same goes for the hotel groundsOverall, another amazing stay in SF. Next trip, we'll definitely consider staying here again. Be sure to book ahead so that you can get a good deal.",3-Aug-16,4
"Not good value for money. Rooms are in poor condition with equipment like showerheads in disrepair. When I awoke early one morning I could not get a cup of coffee as room service, the club lounge and the coffee bar downstairs were closed. Coffee and such should be available 24/7; and the club lounge should be open 24 hours to allow access to coffee, water and tea at all times.",3-Aug-16,2
"Reception was very accommodating is arranging expedited checkin so could sleep before a midnight start to my race. Windows needed to be washed on outside so view would have been more magnificent! Bed was very comfortable both before and after a double marathon. Kindness of reception staff person, Maria, to send up a note of encouragement and food amenities was awesome.",3-Aug-16,5
"This Hyatt is the best location for everything! The rooms are nice, some with great views, worth upgrading for! The staff are really great, happy to help with everything, all of them! Comfortable beds, great sleep.",3-Aug-16,4
"This review is so overdue. My family and I stayed here for 2 nights in January. Prior to our arrival Jason the executive housekeeper contacted me to see for there was anything he could put in the room for us since we were traveling with children. He is the most amazing, detail oriented, thoughtful man. He went above and beyond thinking of any and everything we could have needed. Down to a bottle brush which I had forgotten. He even bought my daughter a gift and had it as a surprise for her with a card when we arrived. I can't even explain how this made our trip. The rooms are beautiful. Beds were comfortable and the restaurant was great as well. We used the club lounge daily and enjoyed it very much. The location is great and I am truly grateful for Jason Hillman and the special way we were treated. We will definitely return.",3-Aug-16,5
"Refurbished, fresh and well located. A good option for work or exploring the city. The club room lounge has fabulous views of the city, so its worth upgrading. Staff are very friendly and its a magnet for Pokemon hunters.",2-Aug-16,4
"I was here for 9 nights and have stayed here several times before. This is a very comfortable sleek hotel and amazingly convenient for all of downtown SF and for any expo at the Moscone. (why I was there). We also hold a small client meeting in the hotel each year and the conference staff are excellent and simply cannot be more helpful. Pretty reasonable rates too if you are a guest.Rooms are good size (for a European) the higher you are the quieter it is. All clean and mine was recently refurbished and in really good nick.Gym - amazing morning views of the sunrise over the bay from the 35th floor, good selection of kit and free weights equipment too. Suggest going up to the conference rooms at the very top to get views over to The Rock etc. Breakfast is very good when you consider eating out can add up to almost the same $$ even if there are some great local diners etc. It was convenient and quick and the buffet was good quality.",2-Aug-16,4
"Best hotel we have been so far in the US, from LA also Las Vegas staying at the suites in Palazzo last week, but this Grand a hyatt takes it a level up. Great check in desk, immediately proposing multiple upgrade choices including suites which we took and what an experience so far. 34th floor, amazing view of San Francisco, great club lounge, top room, the Grand Hyatt immediately accommodated extra beds for our daughters. We just had dinner 1st floor, we recommend Franck there, knows exactly which wine to best taste, we took a great Pinot Californian wine and what an experience. Looking forward to tomorrow",1-Aug-16,5
"I would rate this hotel as excellent. The room was clean, staff was very willing to help with everything, mini fridge, and there was A/C and good temperature control. My only gripe is a lack of vending machines. There was only one in this big hotel with snacks, and it was poorly stocked. We went shopping to stock our fridge with late night snacks. I would definitely stay here again. Great location.",1-Aug-16,5
"Hotel is located very centrally for San Francisco. As many know, the traffic and congestion continues to get worse in the city. Despite that, itâ€™s located centrally so within the Union Square area â€“ anything can be walked to. There is a great gym â€“ awesome view. The gym is the whole 35th floor. Always found equipment and well maintained. The hotels rooms have been upgraded and is very comfortable. One advice: The parking is $65 /day. If you donâ€™t need a car â€“ donâ€™t valet.",31-Jul-16,5
"Good experience. A solid four stars. Check in was a breeze using the new Hyatt app that lets you skip the desk and go straight to the room. We had used points to upgrade to a club floor. We had room 3311 which afforded a nice view of the city. The room itself was in good condition and looked like the pictures. The bed was very comfortable and included feather pillows and nice sheets. We loved the automated black out shade with controls placed on either side of the bed. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was a bit tight, but nice. Toiletries on the club floors were by June Jacobs (had never heard of her before). One of the benefits of the club floor is access to lounge which includes breakfast and snacks throughout the day. While we only used for breakfast, there is good news / bad news here. The bad news was that at breakfast, the lounge is a total mob scene - clearly, demand exceeds capacity and one morning we gave up our seats to an elderly couple trying to find a place to sit. Th good news was that the breakfast spread was decent: OJ, coffee, bagels, lox, eggs, muffins, fruit, etc. Service is good and food was quickly replenished. We finally just ended up asking for a tray and taking things back to our room. All in all, we had a perfectly good stay. But I would think again about upgrading to the club floor - not sure that was worth it. Needless to say, the location on Union Square is unbeatable.",31-Jul-16,3
"We recently stayed here for 5 nights and were allocated a room on the 3rd floor. Check in was fine but at check out, the gentleman was a little aloof and impersonal. Housekeeping were very friendly, polite and very efficient. Our room overlooked the Apple Store and we could see Union Square from our window. We were initially concerned there may have been street noise, but it was actually lovely and peaceful from any city noise. However, the same cannot be said of internal noise. Fellow guests speaking at high volume outside our room at 6am was a regular occurrence. They had little concern for anyone who didn't want to be awake so early, some even shouting from the lift area to family members still in their rooms. This also seemed to be made worse by the gaps at the bottom of the doors, allowing noise through and also banging of doors with automatic shutting action. We also had a room with an adjoining door which was no way near sound proofed enough, so neighbouring voices could be very clearly heard in our room, along with banging on the door. Better fitting of more solid doors would possibly help the situation.The location of this hotel is great and I would definitely considered staying again but I would request a room without an adjoining door, and overlooking the Apple Store. ",31-Jul-16,4
"So the hotel is sharp and the amenities plentiful. Beware tonight that Between the flushing toilets, slamming doors and barking dogs, it was loud to say the least. The staff is great, the bar is terrific and you can't beat the location. Stay here but bring your ear plugs. ",30-Jul-16,3
"My teen daughter and I just returned from a mother/daughter getaway to San Francisco. We spent four nights at the Grand Hyatt. Upon arriving at SFO, we took a taxi to the hotel. Ron at check-in was fabulous. The hotel is right next door to an Apple flagship store, so I was not surprised by the iMac check in stations. We had a room on the 24th floor, beautiful view. We were easily able to walk everywhere during our stay. Cable cars are nearby. We enjoyed ample shopping, great dinners and gelato while people watching in Union Square, just steps from the hotel. SFMoMA, Yerba Buena Gardens, Chinatown, the Financial District and SOMA were just blocks from the hotel. Walking Grant to Columbus was an easy 20 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf, no major hills. We liked that our hotel was in an area that was always vibrant, so we felt very safe. If noise is an issue for you, bring your earplugs. We did occasionally have street noise, especially early in the morning due to nearby construction. Our room was clean, well-lit, good storage, beds were comfy, in room safe and refrigerator. Housekeeping was prompt, we always returned to a clean room. Hotel concierge arranged a car service for our return to the airport. Super easy, we were very happy. Would return to this hotel.",30-Jul-16,5
"We loved our four nights here. The Union Square location was great but everything closed down by 9pm. However, during the day, it's easy to walk to the main attractions such as the Ferry Bldg, Fisherman's Warf and even the AT&T Park.",30-Jul-16,5
The hotel was centrally located and convenient to all the locations that we wished to visit. We were just a few steps from the shopping in Union Square and only about two blocks from China town. The rooms were comfortable and we slept well after all the walking from that days activities. We did take advantage of the concierge level and found the staff to be extremely helpful.,30-Jul-16,4
"Stayed 2 nights at Grand Hyatt. Location wise, this hotel is good. Plenty of stuff to do around the area in terms of pubs, restaurants and shopping. Easy walk to union square and to catch the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. The room was a decent size and clean however our room faced in the opposite direction of Union Square (not the best view). We recommend, on check in, to request a room facing Union Square. The room was right next to their service door and we constantly heard attendants open and shut the door. We were woken up a couple of times by loud folk in the hallway and in the room next door (early morning and late night). We didn't mind the hotel but it reach our expectations.",29-Jul-16,3
"If you'd like to feel special, this is a great place. My wife and I stay here 3 times a year for 4 day weekends, we always get the 2 room suite and it is the best. The Grand Hyatt Club has the best staff, great food, and awesome views. So friendly, courteous, and professional, best service in the whole city.",28-Jul-16,5
"I stayed here for 2 nights with my husband and 3 year old son as part of our trip to the San Francisco Bay Area. When we checked in we noticed the previous guest left some clothes in the closet. We alerted housekeeping who then took the clothes away but no apology. The response at check out was ""Oh I heard about that."" I would have expected more from this establishment!",28-Jul-16,3
our traveler was so impressed with this hotel and their excellent personalized service. keep up the good work! the room was comfortable and spacious. I asked for pics but I guess he was so comfy he forgot!,27-Jul-16,5
"If you love shopping, this hotel is a great choice for your stay in San Francisco! A short walk to Banana Republic, Macy's, Nike store and right next door to the new Apple store.We love Hyatt properties and this hotel is newly remodeled in a cool, urban modern design with an updated reception â€“ no desk, just Mac stations. Super comfortable beds too!You can't beat the view either, get an upper floor if you can and you'll be treated to the million dollar Golden Gate to the Bay bridge panorama on one side and the sprawling southern city on the other.We will definitely be back!",26-Jul-16,5
"The location is good for travelers in the city for business or tourists who want to stay away from the tourist trap area. It's a nice, comfortable hotel but nothing special that will distinguish from other hotels in the area. I'm traveling for work and didn't have much selection. Last week I was at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf, so it's definitely a step up and more enjoyable. The downside for me was the cleaning, or lack of. I found several strands of someone's hair (definitely not mine) and it was in a place that should have been cleaned and is clearly visible.",25-Jul-16,3
"My family of five enjoyed our four-night stay in two adjoining rooms at the Grand Hyatt. We appreciated the courteous hotel staff, comfortable beds and pillows, cleanliness of the hotel and excellent location in the city. We will stay at the Grand Hyatt the next time we visit San Francisco.",25-Jul-16,4
Stayed here while in town for Cavalia show. Beautiful views of the city and within easy walking distance to many attractions. The facilities were immaculate and the attention at the front desk was spot on.,25-Jul-16,5
"This hotel is on the northern edge of Union Square. Near the trolley, market street, and walking distance to China Town, the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf. Bit of a hike with luggage from the Bart but doable if you have a small rolling bag. The room was comfortable. Views are super. But the pillows are like lumpy rocks--ugh. Need replacing.",25-Jul-16,4
"... just saying that at these prices- in San Francisco- you want to feel special and ""privileged"". The Grand Hyatt pulled that off for me nicely. Hotel, I understand, was recently remodeled and it showed... everything was modern and clean, but still cozy.",25-Jul-16,5
"The rooms are clean but small. The Asian cleaning people are very professional and work hard. The cleaning products make the rooms smell bad (too many chemicals, too much chlorine). The windows do not open and the air conditioning will not eliminate the chemical smell... The receptionists are very nice. The concierge ladies are unprofessional, and rude - let aside slow and inefficient. The hotel is a mix of people from hundreds of nations. Most customers are highly educated and polite. Very few rare exceptions. Prices are high. We paid almost $400 for one king bed, small room. LOCATION is the best thing about this hotel. Oh... the restaurant is great. Excellent waiters, kind, professional and with a great sense of humor, especially the Asian ones. Waiters and cleaning people saved the review. Without them, a one star would have been in place, not a 4 star.",24-Jul-16,4
"Very nice stay at the Grand Hyatt. Staff, attendants, and all grand Hyatt ""folk"" were courteous, attentive, and accommodating. Location is very good in Union Square; easy access to many modes of transportation - especially historic trolley cars. Good dining options within a close walk. The hotel is modern but the size of the rooms are smallish and the overall condition of the furniture, fixtures, and furnishings are not always upper tier quality. Club Room access was convenient and food and general were very good. Valet parking is good but uber-expensive.",24-Jul-16,4
Family vacation - we had 2 rooms on the 17th floor. Our rooms were large and we enjoyed the views on the 17th floor. The beds were comfortable and the amenities in the room were stellar. The service from the front desk to room service were top notch. You will not find friendlier people. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again when I return to San Francisco.,24-Jul-16,5
"Beautiful hotel just steps away from Union Square. Shopping, dining, bars are all nearby. The room was comfortable and the view from the 24th floor was amazing. Try to get a room on a higher floor if you want a good view.",24-Jul-16,5
"Great property to be in the middle of the city. Once the construction is completed, it will be even better. The hotel is walkable to my business meetings. The room was clean and housekeeping staff was wonderful. They were polite in the morning greeting guests and kept the room clean and neat.",24-Jul-16,5
"We arrived here at the last day of stay for our trip around California. This hotel is located right next to Union Square, and we were able to some last minute Disney Store shopping and grab dinner just few blocks away. The lobby of this hotel is artistic and inviting, and has many spots to relax, if desired. The check-in and check-out processes were quick and easy, and the receptionists were helpful and kind.Jason, Assistant Executive Housekeeper, personally emailed us prior to arrival in order to best prepare our room for our arrival with our child. This was fantastic, and our room was even more prepared for our child than we expected. There was even a diaper genie which was super helpful for dirty diapers. It really helped us out to help us have the room be so well prepared, and we're thankful for his effort.Overall, the experience was better than even we had anticipated. We plan on coming back here in the future, and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",20-Jul-16,5
"As a native Californian, I was surprisingly startled at the ease with which one could stay in the very heart of downtown San Francisco! Too often, one makes decisions based on the traffic, crowd congestion, etc. Much to my surprise, the Grand Hyatt provided clean, tranquil rooms with a very accommodating staff from the bellman to the staff in their coffee bar. A true oasis in the very heart of the city!",20-Jul-16,5
Our room was very small. It seemed so much smaller than pictured. The floor was not very clean. The towels seemed damp or not properly dried before folding. Check in was difficult due to construction in the area. The lobby was not very friendly. The price we paid was within $70 of a 5-star luxury hotel. I wish I had selected differently. I do not think that the value was here for the price.,19-Jul-16,3
"The Hyatt Grand in San Francisco was a very nicely appointed and clean hotel in the heart of Union Square. The rooms are very small but once we settled in we didn't have any issues with space for our family of 4. A few issues included the mattress which made a squeaking noise at any movement. It seemed as if they had a plastic bed pad. Fortunately we were tired from the days activities to sleep thru it. They need to address the sliding door on the bathroom and see if it can be altered to provide a little more privacy. The double beds were very small but there aren't many other hotels with queen bed options anyway. It seems to be in line with most other hotels in the area but the hotel was updated, clean and nice to return to after exploring.",19-Jul-16,4
"In all of the years visiting the city, I have never stayed here. Driving up to the hotel, I could not have had a nicer group of valets. Check in was a breeze, the room was huge and had a fantastic view. The location was great and the beds vere very comfortable! Definitely going back!",19-Jul-16,5
Great location and staff was very accommodating. We were very impressed with service from bar and food was excellent. Location was right near shopping and excellent restaurants of types were close by. Only complaint was that someone was smoking in a room close to us. Non-smoking hotel.,19-Jul-16,4
"Bad service. Room not cleaned fast nor thoroughly. There were no cups for water or coffee, even though there is a coffeepot. No complimentary bottled water. Room very tiny. Dated furniture and style. All this for over 300 bucks a night, was not good value. Better look elsewhere.",18-Jul-16,1
"This hotel was clean and comfortable. Service was fine. Good location. However, nothing about it - i.e. room, lobby, bar, restaurant, etc. stood out. Room seemed a bit worn (carpet). Fine for transient business travel but not a ""hot spot"" if you are looking to enjoy your stay as part of a leisure trip to SF.",18-Jul-16,3
"Wow! Really enjoyed the wheelchair accessible room here. Great bed/pillows. Nice view. I actually got a decent shower on a vacation! A great roll in shower, with a hand held shower head that had spray options that worked! With water pressure! I know, right!! A clean gimpy, is a happy gimpy, and makes for a better world ;) Here comes the bummer part of the room, it was noisy. The concierge desk was awesome (Liz & Anne). The complimentary breakfast in the dining room was a happy surprise. Creamy scrambled eggs one morning, many options with veggies and cheese, various pastries, cappuccino machine, oatmeal, etc. What a delight Judy was, she worked every day we were there. I looked forward to her company every morning, so sweet and helpful!",18-Jul-16,5
"This was my second time staying at this hotel, the first being this time last year for Intersolar North America trade show at Moscone. This hotel is right next to Union Square and there is usually always something to do.There is construction around the property so it gets loud during the day and it seems like there is the occasional horn honking through out the night- typical of big cities.The staff is pro and is always on the lookout to attend to your needs- bell hops, check in, bar, room service, etc. The bar on the second floor serves an awesome Moscow Mule, by the way :DI was upgraded to a higher level floor room because of my Gold status- definitely worth having a rewards membership with Hyatt. Hotel offers amenities/toilettries in case you forgot yours. Workout room is pretty good and overlooks the city on one of the highest floors in the hotel.There is a Starbucks across the street as you walk outside. Lots of restaurants in the area within walking distance.Recommend parking at the Sutter-Stockton garage which is caddy corner from the hotel. I stayed for 3.5 days and it was $111- about $31-35 a day. Hotel offers valet for $65/day and partial drop off at their garage for $45/day. There is also a parking garage underneath Union Square. A 2 minute walk or less from the garage gets you to the hotel.",16-Jul-16,5
"Stayed here two nights. Very hip hotel. Loved the check in via their app. My room overlooking Fisherman's Warf was superb. The staff was very helpful in arranging reservations. I wish they had full spa on site. My previous stays have been at Ritz which is more luxury oriented, Hyatt is more business.",16-Jul-16,4
"I booked 3 rooms for 4 nights that costs almost a thousand bucks per night through rocketmiles (priceline company) for a double bed room. I emailed asking to be placed all in the same floor and required 2 extra bed. They said its all been requested.Then while checked in by ira, 2 of the room were downgraded to king size room due to they cant place rollaway in a double bed and which is much much more cheaper and what a small room. Beside me was a caucasian family who book 2 king size bed and upgraded to a suite. Ha! And you downgrade customer who paid higher? I dont care if someone get upgraded, but you downgrade my room then its a problem for me. Or perhaps your hotel was just a pure racists. One of the room need to be extended by one night since they only can give late check out until 1pm. So Ira told me to pay direct to them with their own rate. I asked how much would that be, she said the same price that Priceline give me which is almost a grand. I checked through an app in front of her with my hotels.com app, the price at hotels.com was only three hundred fifteen including tax. I told her, i will book through hotels.com. She then told me, she will ask for her manager to give the price match as what hotels.com has.Then she gave us higher price which is three seventy for a night extra, which I told her no. and asked I thought they can do price match? She said no, thats the lowest they can do.Then I told her I will book via hotels.com then, since I feel like taken advantage by this hotel. She said, ""no if you book via other 3rd party you will need to check out before noon and check in to another room after 3pm, you cant stay in the same room you are staying now, its not possible."" She knew that The room extended was with an infant and a small kid and it will be troublesome for us to move and wait in the lobby, so they pressured me with that. One hour after checked in my card was charged 400usd. They said its for security.One of my sister in law booking (she checked in earlier than us) she was asked to moved too because they said they give her a promo rate. If they wanted to stay, they will need to add more. Look, I thought staying at hyatt will makes me secure, like any other hyatt. But sadly this establishment is a green eyed monster who tried to rob you even to your cents. This is the greatest joke they made in a bad economy, isnt it?Last day I called the bell, he took my luggages and drop it to the main door, he didn't want to upload it to the suv and said the doorman will do that for us. He took the tip and leave and none help us with our luggages after that.The positive thing here is the housekeeping. All of them are nice and helpful. The breakfast is poor, dont bother coming, scrambled egg, one with ham one is plan and another one is mushroom, potatoes and sausages. Just go across the road starbucks they have better option too. They open a starbucks stall too infront of the conciarge and bill twice more expensive.You ruin the image of grand hyatt, and no I wont stay in any other hyatt anymore, because your management is a rubbish rip off place. Loosing a customer who cares right? Good luck with the pennies.",15-Jul-16,1
"Stayed here for 5 nights last week. Location is pretty good with lots of shopping around. Very busy however and there is major road construction along stockton but we were not bothered by the noise. You can walk to china town and the Little Italy area within 10-15 min and to Coit tower in about 25 min (great walk..wear running shoes). The room is big..not luxurious..we stayed in 2117 standard king facing Union Square. There are no robes or slippers in the room but if you ask, they will bring them. The size of the washroom is large (although we had an accessible room so maybe that's why) but there isn't too much counter space or hooks in the washroom. There are not that many drawers either. The bed is comfortable. Staff is friendly and the doorman was very helpful with directions. ",15-Jul-16,4
"I sometimes stay at the Grand Hyatt when I have to because the other hotels in the vicinity are full or too expensive. I don't like it, because there basically are no facilities and it is very difficult to get attention from staff. There is no minibar and when I (usually late) arrive at the hotel there is nothing in the room, not even a bottle of water. And water is also the only thing you can get brought up to the room, if someone pick up the phone that is...I find it very strange that this place is a ""Grand Hyatt"", it is definitely the worst GH I have ever stayed in.",14-Jul-16,3
"Excellent 3td stay at this hotel, a great location, close to shopping, restaurants, transit. A very busy and safe area. Great hotel for couples as well as families.All staff was great. Concierge was so helpful, even the ladies at the coffee bar gave us great directions. Room was always cleaned by the time we arrived back in out room in the afternoon.Can't wait to return here again!",13-Jul-16,5
The location of this hotel is very nice especially if you do not have a rental car. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The few problems we encountered with housekeeping flaws were eventually corrected after the second day.,13-Jul-16,4
"We spent a long week end in family. Good location, concierge ladies very efficient for rÃ©servations and assistance. breakfast is correct. Lobby Very sad and common for such level of Hotels. The rooms are correct but bathrooms are more three stars for me. Last i don't know the standards in SF but parking at 70 usd is huge comparing to Europe. ",13-Jul-16,3
Amazing hotel and people. These guys actually care about customers. I was celebrating my wife's b'day and these guys made sure it was well taken care of and made her feel special. One of the best hotels in all categories i have stayed anywhere in the world.,13-Jul-16,5
"Spent 4th of July Weekend at the Hyatt in Union Square. Highly recommend hotel. The hotel's staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel was beautiful, and clean rooms. Also, the hotel location was great. Centrally located to walk to many restaurants and stores. I was glad the hotel had a small kiosk Starback's on the lobby floor and a restaurant and bar in the hotel.",13-Jul-16,5
A block from Union Square. Nice clean modern hotel. Parking is expensive - but they give you option to self park at lot across the street for $45 per day. Buy their continental breakfast option - it's continental breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvre on their 32nd floor club room for everyone in the room for $50 a day. Their free wi-fi is very slow.,12-Jul-16,4
"Had a great time at the Hyatt very friendly staff and always courteous ,will definitely stay again , within walking distance to all of the restaurant,coffee shop on every corner all major shopping area union square is wonderful to hang out ",12-Jul-16,5
The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful hotel very centrally located and about a 5 minute walk from Union square. The hotel is beautiful and seems to be fairly recently renovated and the service was impeccable from the time we checked in until the time we checked out. It was a little on the expensive side but there aren't too many deals around union square. The rooms were very nice and modern and the fitness area was well equipped. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. ,12-Jul-16,5
"Excellent mattresses, fresh air and a really nice view through the balcony sliding door, and clean beds (no bedspreads,thank you! just fresh sheets on top of a thin down comforter). Lots of desk space and bathroom counter space. Everything laid out for efficiency, comfort and quiet. Very good value for the money and a super location.",12-Jul-16,5
LOVED this hotel. The staff was great too. Very helpful. Every person we talked to was very nice. Love the location. Room was great too. Nice view of Union Square. Will tell everyone to try this place. Can't wait to stay again.,12-Jul-16,5
"Excellent location and amenities. Staff is terrific. Pricing fluctuates greatly depending on census, holidays, etc., but probably floats with the rest of The City's hotels. Only caveat is to make sure no valuables left in car or securely locked up as we had a problem on a prior visit (3rd party to Hyatt; not Hyatt's fault per se)",12-Jul-16,5
"The hotel is ""Grand"" only in it's name. Cleaning staff has no idea what attention to detail is, they'll short you on towels, so make sure to call for more oh and if you plan to valet make sure you're driving an expensive car, otherwise they'll just think you're waiting for someone to come down. Truth be told I'd stay away spend you money on another hotel that will provide the right experience for what you're paying.",12-Jul-16,2
"Excellent location, near Union Sq, short walk to Chinatown etc ... and shopping. Good clean rooms, pricey but then everything is in SF ... good guidance from concierge. Recommend because of location and service.",11-Jul-16,5
"One block from union Square makes this a great place to stay. Not that there's much in the square, it's the location. All the shops and walking is great to just about anywhere. Great staff and easy to Check in and out. But it's a big hotel and that brings the traffic in and out. Quiet and room layout is very comfortable, no coffee maker in room or refrigerator. So you have to head to the lobby with the masses for a cup or muffin but the Starbucks is across the street. No robes in the room but you could probably call for them. Great views from the workout room and its adequate. Almost a four star. ",11-Jul-16,4
We had a little trouble with parking but in the end we were able to park for free but that's not where I saw the excellence by Saleem... During the baggage storage my little boys sword that he got in china town was broken... When I showed Saleem what had happened he called the engineer to have the sword fixed I was ok with that... Disappointed but satisfied he sensed that and took off ones nights stay and provided water and snacks while we waited for the sword to be repaired... That level of customer service is so far beyond what you usually experience I was floored... Thanks Saleem and we will be staying at the Grand Hyatt the next time we are in SF,10-Jul-16,5
Did I get your attention? We stayed the night of Independance Day Celebrations and there were fireworks galor all around us and the noice was a small hum in the room. It was nice to be able to sleep sound because of the seamingly quiet room. I woke up at midnight and the fireworks were still going and I could tell because of the glow on the fog. The noise was still a light hum. That was important since I had meetings early the next morning.,10-Jul-16,5
"Stayed here for a business trip. Location was perfect, lot of great restaurants (cafes to great dinner options) all around. Shopping all around for my wife that accompanied me. Cable car line picks up 1 block over on Powell. Concierge and Bell staff were all friendly and engaging. We were greeted by Steve at the Front Desk- he started the stay off on the most positive note! He was friendly, engaging, and took an interest in our story. We had recently been married so Steve had a little something sent up to our room! Bed was comfortable, a little on the stiff side but that was ok.",9-Jul-16,5
"A modern hotel, in an excellent location. Union Square is close to many stores and restaurants, and also to cable car stops. The check in was efficient. The rooms are comfortable, but watch out for rooms faced to noisy spots, as the windows do not have an adequate noise reduction system (there are some ear plugs available in those rooms). Many channel options on TV. Different choices of pillows. The gym is complete and there is a half basketball court. The restaurant serves excellent meals. I definitely recommend this hotel.",9-Jul-16,5
windows in room in poor condition. you can feel the wind through window & because the windows are in poor repair it is very loudin the rooms. even 25 floors up. parking garage damaged my vehicle & refused to take responsability.,9-Jul-16,3
"Was not great that on arrival - which was late because of a flight issue - the room I had signed up for and paid for was no longer available (despite calling before I took off to fly to CA). Instead I was ""upgraded"" to a room with a view of the city. Apparently that means the building across the street. Also, there was construction going on that I didn't expect. On the positive, the hotel was very clean and the staff was great. But overall I expected more from a Grand Hyatt, and I likely wouldn't stay here again.",7-Jul-16,3
"4 star hotel with 5 star service. In general people in sf were not that friendly, however not at the hyatt. Every single employee we came across was friendly and helpful. One up restaurant has the best salamon! We willDefinitely be back very soon",7-Jul-16,5
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt San Francisco for a few nights on a business trip and had a great stay. The location is right next to Union Square in downtown San Francisco so it's close to everything whether you're in the city for business or pleasure. The staff was friendly and check-in/check-out was a breeze. The hotel offers top-notch amenities that you'd expect from a Grand Hyatt. Although the bar/restaurant area looked modern, given the location I did not eat at the hotel. I used the fitness center and the executive lounge though and they are both on the highest floors with amazing views of the city and the bay. My room was modern and comfortable as well, and if you're on a high floor you could enjoy a breathtaking view.",7-Jul-16,5
"Super over priced and extremely dated...maybe 20 years ago it might have been 'nice'The 'Business Center"" if one could call it that, tiny room with two Macs and keyboards fixed to the bench, need to work on your lap top? Good luck!US$2 a page to print and US$20 for the privilege of using the box...oh, their WiFi does not reach this spot!The super expensive conference rooms have little to no sound insulation so noise from the atrium and adjoin rooms is always there - not acceptable.We do however, compliment the photographer who shot the promotional photos for this property.Had they been realistic, we wouldn't be here, nor writing this review",6-Jul-16,2
We stayed in March and found the construction around the area to be noisy and city noise to be invasive in our room. We were on one of the highest floors so insulation and soundproofing must be part of the problem. When we asked about the poor insulated windows one of the managers said it was something that would be updated soon. But too late for us. We also could had some sort of elevator noise or washing equipment whoosing in our bathroom every evening. Never did determine what it was definitely some machinery in the building. When we left the hotel to come home we were exhausted and disappointed in our overpriced room. Most of the people who worked there were aloof and disinterested. Concierge was capable but on auto-pilot and bored. Never anyone rude just going through the motions. To be honest the room was big and spacious and nice bathroom but with low water pressure. The modern decor was faded alittle and bed was hard as a rock. I am surprised that the last couple of Hyatt's we have stayed at that the mattresses have been so hard. Definitely not a 5 star bed. We did enjoy the concierge suite the food was very good and a nice view every evening to enjoy with a glass of wine - it made our stay alittle better. We will come back to San Francisco for sure but will be staying somewhere else.,5-Jul-16,3
"Wife and toddler and I stayed here recently. We live in the Bay Area but decided to have a San Francisco ""staycation"" over July 4 weekend. We picked the Grand Hyatt primarily because of its central location near Union Square. There are lots of hotels in that area, but this one had larger rooms than most of the older nearby hotels, which was important to us given our need for a portable crib. We were not disappointed. The room was pretty spacious (by downtown SF standards) and had a great view. We faced west so we had a City View and a bit of Union Square as well. We were on the 24th floor, so it was also fairly quiet, although we could definitely hear street noise, especially with the window open. Not a complaint. Just an observation. The room was modern, the bed was comfortable, and the shower was surprisingly nice for a big hotel, where the water pressure is often severely lacking. We didn't use any of the hotel amenities, but the staff we encountered was very friendly and courteous. We would definitely stay here again.",5-Jul-16,5
hotel location is ok.. first Hotel that doesn't have a parking.. they can park your car for $67.00 fee excuse me. And this hotel doesn't have a Pool also.. for the price you don't get what you deserve.,5-Jul-16,2
"This was our first stay at this hotel, and we were pleasantly impressed. All people connected with check-in (car, luggage, room,, etc) were very pleasant and helpful, but not in-your-face. The room was clean, fresh and comfortable. Bathroom was newly renovated and great. We enjoyed every aspect, except for the air conditioning, which was always COLD not matter the setting. We reported it on checkout.Restaurant exellent- reviewed separately.",4-Jul-16,4
"Stayed for 6 nights while visiting San Francisco and was very happy with the stay. First the Location is great as its in Union Square and minutes walk from many good restaurant and shopping options. China Town is about a 5 minute walk. For Fisherman's wharf its a bit of a walk but there is public transportation minutes away to take you there which the concierge directed us how to get to. The hotel is very modern and has Free Wi-Fi which worked great, Black Out Curtains in the Room which were operated by remote and worked great as well. Additionally the Rooms were very clean and modern so a plus there as well. We paid a bit extra and had a higher floor room with a view of the bay which was excellent. If its your first trip to SF in quite a while, I would recommend getting the view! We ate breakfast at the cafe one morning and it was very good but as mentioned there are many restaurants in the area. While I can't complain about anything, the thing I think that sets the property apart though and what stood out to me is the friendliness of the staff at the hotel. Everyone from the front desk at check in and check out to the doormen and valet couldn't have been nicer and more attentive. As we had a car we interacted many times with the valets to get our car. Each time, they hustled to get the car for us and always welcomed us back to the hotel pleasantly. Never a problem. Overall excellent stay!",4-Jul-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt SF has great location at union square. The rooms are nice and modern. However, there are small issues that keeps me from giving this hotel 5 stars. The most frustrating thing was the shower head. The design of the shower head coupled with the low water pressure meant that in order to get your hair wet, you had to bang your head against the wall as the water flow could only get as far as 3 inches off the shower wall. This was the most ridiculous thing I have ever experienced in a hotel. The other ""small issue"" is that the buttons in the elevators were filthy. ",4-Jul-16,4
"Good Hotel, good location neat and friendly staff. No water bottles in room. Break fast no variety and very limited to compared to other Hyatt in other parts of world. Stayed 7 days - absolutely no change in breakfast menu. out of few items 3 are scrambled egg items. Center of city and very near to Union sq. Lots of options to nearby restaurants ans shopping (macy's). Careful about billing. In spite of room booked with breakfast, final bill comes with breakfast price added. Requested and removed the same without any questions. Chin town nearby. 30 mnts walk to piers and creek/marina side. Hotel Telephone calls kill you. Any call even 1 sec charge you nearly USD10. No need to get the line, but voice mail same charging. 3 rings US telephones goes to voice call, 10 such calls USD100+ a lot to pay to homeless people in street.",3-Jul-16,4
"The Grand Hyatt is a great hotel for a business trip to SF. Recent room remodels and location make it a top option. That said the high level of service sets it apart. Just want to applaud Steve at Reception and John, the Concierge for their attention to detail that made my recent visit memorable.",30-Jun-16,5
"We stayed in this quite modern and tech savvy high-rise in Union square.The breakfast staff, including George, Douglas, Wendy,Ed and Guadalupe are really attentive. I mean is San Fran really child freindly? Not everywhere! But here, with a group of kids, we did it all.Breakfast buffet here is reasonable for a meeting as well as quite good.",30-Jun-16,4
"Grand Hyatt is a wonderful hotel chain and this one is no exception. Great location in the heart of San Francisco. I was here for business in he Financial District and was able to easily walk everywhere I needed from the hotel. The taxi ride from the airport was a bit high though.Lobby is nice with plenty of seating. Cozy fireplace and convenient elevators.Rooms are a good size. Beds are super comfy with tons of pillows. TV is an oversized flat screen. Plenty of desk space. Coffee maker, iron and hair dryer all in the room. They have a large list of toiletries that they have available complimentary in case you forgot some necessities. I noticed this because I forgot my toothpaste! They quickly brought it up to the room by discreetly knocking and hanging it on the door handle. Great views from the high floors! They have a nice onsite restaurant, bar as well as a coffee store that serves pastries, fruit, granola and such. The workout room is really small with about 8 cardio machines, a few weight machines and small sample of free weights. I would definitely stay here again!",30-Jun-16,4
"Really enjoyed our time in this location--were able to walk to almost everywhere we wanted to go. Our room was modern and very clean. It was quiet within the hotel but because we don't use the air conditioning at night, the street noise (even 15 floors below us) could be quite loud. The gym could equipment could use an overhaul. We had to try several machines before finding one that actually worked as it should--in particular the TV and sound system. We really appreciated having a water dispenser by the pop/ice machine on our floor. It was handy for filling our water bottles.",30-Jun-16,4
My family and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at The Grand Hyayy. The hotel is beautiful. The room was clean and beautiful. Staff was incedible and attended to every need. Beds were comforable which is a huge plus after walking San Francisco streets. I can't wait to visit again. Will definitely return to this hotel.,30-Jun-16,5
"Great staff and property. area is close to attractions and shops, the staff is very concerned about you and your stay and concierge was amazing in planing my day being as though i was there for just a weekend.",29-Jun-16,5
"This hotel is in a great location. Very convenient to transit and shopping. Stayed in a room with a view of Union Square, so had great views of the city. All of the staff is very helpful and courteous.",29-Jun-16,5
"I know the hotel is in the city but some have rooftop pools. This one does not have a pool. Say what? Then, there is a rooftop room or observation room that we tried to go up to but the elevator would not stop there or even allow us to press the button. We finally asked a staff member and he said oh, that is only reserved for events. What again? For someone to pay 650 average a night, I would say a rooftop view is in order! I had points/rewards with my Hyatt card to use on this room but if not I would not have stayed here. I can't phantom a person paying this much and getting a tiny room. I picked this one because it is in an ideal location, smack in Union Square, but I came to find out I miss the Wharf easy slow lifestyle. In US, people are everywhere, like ants .. all for themselves. I did not enjoy Grand Hyatt at all. What really irks me is that they don't have a drive in area so you would pull up if there are spaces, if not, you would have to drive around again? That's insane. There is about 3 or 4 spaces max? I don't remember but that is just so stressful just trying to check in. Overall, I would not stay here again even if it was 150 dollars. I guess I don't like high rises. I'm more of a warmer place like the Hyatt wharf.",28-Jun-16,3
"Stayed for 4 days, had a corner suite, they said the upgraded me because of my points and credit card but it's a sad upgrade if that was so since the view was of other buildings air shafts or whatever and very small room, it was noisy in the day. The room was modern and clean and nighttime was quiet. Great downtown area, easy to walk to restaurants but at night recommend Uber, I was told by Uber drivers not to walk on your own which I did one night and it was pretty sketchy a couple blocks away after 9pm. Staff was excellent. Coffee place was ok but breakfast sandwiches were very McDonalds type.",28-Jun-16,5
"I stayed at this hotel before years ago and liked it. This time it is even better. The room is modern and clean. The bed is extra comfortable. I had one of their ADA room with extra large bathroom on high floor with a view of Union Square. The bed night stands have a remote control of curtain on both sides of the bed, and a small bendable reading lamps at the headboard. Free WiFi, with large flat screen TV, safe, coffee maker, ironing board, and spacious. The price is very reasonable at $219/night.restaurant on second floor was nice at reasonable prices. There is a new Apple computer store next door, and art show across street with different sculptures and paint for sale with a CafÃ©. 5 minutes walking to shops and 15 minutes walk to China Town. I walked every day to eat at different restaurant in the area.",28-Jun-16,5
"My husband and our Zoe have been coming to this hotel for several years now. It's location is the best. Rooms are clean, spacious, quiet and what a view on the 30th floor. The gym is more than adequate with a view of the Bay Bridge. Room service is great! I would give this hotel a 5-star but because we are not crazy about their breakfast or dinner I give it a 4 rating. Thank goodness there loads of restaurants around the area. Concierge, personnel at the front doors are always present to open the door for you with a pleasant greeting.What a warm feeling!!! Highly recommended!",28-Jun-16,4
"We enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. The beds are very comfortable. This hotel is centrally located for all amusements in the city. Just blocks from China Town, shopping, Union Square, and the best restaurants around!",28-Jun-16,5
Grand Hyatt is perfectly located in downtown SF. The rooms are exceptionally clean and good size. The staff is very attentive. Stayed here numerous times and have always found it to be my first choice for SF lodging!,28-Jun-16,5
Excellent location. Rooms were clean and staff extremley helpful. Gentlemen who worked the front doors greeted each guest as if they were their best friends. Front desk outstanding. You just do not see that type of service. Good value for an upper end hotel. The taxes for the city are nuts but that has nothing to do with the hotel.,27-Jun-16,5
"Was there for a business meeting. Overall it was a good experience, friendly staff and nice rooms. I especially liked how you could use an app for your room key as it was one less thing to keep track of (and I always have my phone handy).",27-Jun-16,5
"Good hotel if you want to stay in the center on union squarePros- perfect location in center of union square with many eateries and shop and fashion mall around- clean rooms- modern room- good house keeping- nice layout on lobby- nice staff- easy to find taxiCons- a bit expensive but within the price range of union square area, worth it for its location",27-Jun-16,4
"The location of this hotel is great. A 10 min walk will bring you to china town, financial district, shopping malls. Located next to Union Square, you can find everything you want here. The hotel is a little dated, the staff are friendly. Nonetheless, acceptable ",25-Jun-16,4
"This is a high quality hotel with a great location right off Union Square - a prime shopping and dining lhub San Francisco. We cashed in some Hyatt Gold Pass points to get upgraded to a Regency Club floor. Our room had the best view towards the San Francisco Bay. Our bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was top-notch. Unfortunately, the Regency Club lounge was usually very crowded with other guests, so we didn't have the feeling of being pampered or relatively peaceful luxury we have enjoyed in other Regency Club lounges. Being located right by Union Square, it was very easy for us to head out on foot to great stores, restaurants and other attractions, and to have access to cable cars and trains.",24-Jun-16,4
"Stayed here for 3 nights for the NBA finals. We got there early in the day and were able to check in which was great. Customer service very friendly and helpful. Great location to walk to just about anywhere. About 5 minutes to China Town, 25 minutes to the Wharf. The Trolley line is just 1 block over. shopping all around. The hotel was nice enough but nothing fancy. We were up on the 12th floor and had a screaming baby in the next room and could hear every bit of it so the walls are on the thin side. We didn't try the restaurant there as chose to go out and try other places. There's only one mirror in the room and it's in the bathroom so made it difficult to try and get ready when someone was in the bathroom. (only a female would notice this!) Mini fridge in the room was great to keep drinks in for our trips back into the room. Comfortable beds.",23-Jun-16,4
"I am a frequent Hyatt traveler for the simple fact that they never disappoint, and this stay was no different. My fiancÃ© and I arrived at about 10:30 AM, way before check in time, but the front desk staff still promptly checked us in. I felt terrible because we had to switch our rooms mid day (there was a terrible creaking noise coming from the headboard that literally would not stop) but they had no issue immediately moving our room. I was a little underwhelmed by the size of the room, but given the location that was to be expected. The property itself is beautiful and the location is extremely convenient for those doing all of the tourist type things in the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the area. ",21-Jun-16,5
"The location is one of the best for downtown San Francisco. Close to everything, yet a few minutes away from busy Market St. The view from my room was fantastic. The room was very clean, the staff friendly.",21-Jun-16,5
"Excellent location, nice big room with a view of Union Square, comfortable bed. I love the clean modern feel of Hyatt hotels, the art in the lobby and little touches like putting paperback books in your room.A few little niggles - nice to have a bathtub, not just a shower, but the tub is very small (not like the first Grand Hyatt I ever stayed in, the one in Berlin, with a huge soaking bathtub and walk in rain shower. The Berlin Grand Hyatt really raised my expectations for the brand, the US ones have not been on that level.) The friendly young man at reception checked me in and asked, as I am a platinum member, if I would like a newspaper sent on the mornings of my stay so I said sure, why not, but no paper ever came. I don't really care about a paper but it is slightly annoying to have something like that offered and then it doesn't happen. There are no bottles of water for you in the room, you have to call and request them, same with a robe and slippers. I do like that there is no mini-bar, an empty fridge you can store your own drinks and snacks in is much better in my opinion.Very minor point - I didn't like the music in the elevators, sort of rap music or something, I thought it was tacky but someone must like it I guess.But all in all a very nice hotel and I will probably be back.",20-Jun-16,4
"The hotel was nice and clean. Most of the staff were very nice. The food that they provided us with, however was not appetizing. Eggs were watery and fake, the salad had a strange orange dressing that tasted like soup. Other than that, my stay went very well. It is a beautiful hotel, and the pillows in the rooms are the most comfortable pillows I have ever slept on!",20-Jun-16,4
Excellent in most every way except for those wishing a softer more comfortable bed. TV does not include HBO and movie selection and remote control is unusual. The check-in process is different but quick and the location could not be better.,20-Jun-16,4
"Great place to stay. Room was of a high standard, large Windows affording views overlooking part of Union Square and beyond to the sea. Very comfy bed and pillows, luxury toiletries and gourmet coffee for coffee machine. When booking the room we had seen review tips suggesting high floor which we requested, this was granted and we were given a room on the 26th floor, 09. The staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant, One Up is a good place to eat especially especially if your day has been long one. Recommend from us.",19-Jun-16,5
"Great hotel , we are a family of 5 , my mom , dad , aunt at their 60s and my 5 years old daughter. Staff are very friendly and helpful, great location, we could walk everywhere or uber was convenient. Rooms are spacious and good layout, we booked seaview and it was amazing ! Breakfast was great, good quality good with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries every morning , they also offer great tea . Staff at breakfast place was very efficient and friendly. We will definitely return to this hotel. We had a fantastic and enjoyable stay !",19-Jun-16,5
"Stayed here in June 2015 with family. Good location, had booked club floor rooms so freedom to eat for breakfast and unlimited drinks too. Location is great. Staff needs to be more hospitable and more warm. Recommend for staying again ",19-Jun-16,3
"I visited for a conference and brough along my 11 month old son. The Hyatt went above and beyond in making his stay comfortable. Most places only provide a pack and play, but here we were given a pack and play, blanket, infant bath tub and shampoo/wash etc, a bottle brush and dish soap (!!), and a bath toy. These made such a huge difference in the comfort of our stay! They also provided a high chair once we asked. I also had a family member coming to help provide child care, and requested an adjoining room. They were able to guarantee this which many hotels don't do. The restaurant (one up) was delicious, though a bit pricey but lunch was the most reasonable. From the doorman, to the front desk to the housekeepers, everyone was extremely nice and helpful. I would definitely stay here again, and if you are travelling with a baby or kids you won't regret it.",17-Jun-16,5
"This hotel has been around for several decades now but, as is usual with the Hyatt, the rooms have been updated constantly. Nevertheless, the regular rooms are on the small side and the bathtubs are very uncomfortable. The rooms could also do with some bathrobes. Overall though, the view from my room was gorgeous, check in was seamless, service and food was very good and the hotel's location is top notch. If only for that, I would highly recommend this hotel.",15-Jun-16,4
"We stayed here for two nights (would have definitely stayed longer!). The location means you can walk right out to the shops and restaurants, which we found particularly convenient in the evenings when we went out for dinner. A personal highlight were the views from our room and the guest lounge. Only negative was that we found the dinner menu in the hotel restaurant was limited. There are numerous nearby places to eat outside the hotel anyway that this wasn't a huge problem.",15-Jun-16,5
"...excellent location near everything. Well maintained, classy hotel. Staff very professional. Been coming here for many, many years. Recommend very highly. Nice views, rooms in excellent condition. Attentive staff.",14-Jun-16,5
From the minute you get off the shuttle you are greeted with a warm smile and willingness to satisfy. I will admit that the front desks are a bit weird but it isn't the employee's fault. Someone at the top thought that weird shaped pods were better for checking in guests than the standard long desk. The location of the hotel makes it easy to catch a cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. The only thing it lacked was a swimming pool.,14-Jun-16,5
"I was in town for business and booked a regular queen room, luckily everyone from the conference had checked out and I was able to get an upgrade. also, was able to use the club floor which was nice to go and work as well as grab a snack. The room had robe and slippers as well as plenty of room in the bedroom and bathroom. Wifi was fast and easy to use which is great for business travelers.Room service was fast and the food was about average, the mashed potatoes were a bit weird not sure what was used in them. Close to everything but that also means you are close to BARt and the homeless who hang out by BART.",13-Jun-16,4
"The hotel and the room are beautiful, decorated in a classy modern style. The front desk staff and concierge people were extremely courteous and helpful. We didn't patronize the restaurant or room service so have no basis for comment on those features.Our only complaint is that the furnishings of the room were such that there was no obvious way to plug in a mobile phone by the bedside for overnight charging. In this day and age that is most likely something that most guests would wish to use. The phones had to be placed across the room on the desk in order to reach an accessible outlet which means that if they are needed during the night one must jump out of bed and cross the room to get to them. Not a huge deal but also something that could have been easily accommodated by the room designer.Bottom line, I would recommend the hotel and would stay there again myself.",13-Jun-16,5
"The hotel has been remodeled and room are awesome. The hardwood floor and meticulously clean bathroom enhanced the typical hotel stay as did the bedside controls for lighting and the window covers. The desk / work area was more than adequate with a very comfortable chair. There is an in-room refrigerator, but no snack bar. The room rate is very pricey, but that is to be expected for a hotel on the edge of Union Square - the heart of the shopping district. The downside for this hotel was the food menu. Breakfast was good, but the lunch and dinner menus were extremely limited, uninspiring and not particularly healthy. However, the numerous restaurants in the immediate vicinity allow a person who has time to get just about any type of cuisine day or night. Unfortunately, I was there on business, and needed to order room service in order to get my work accomplished and the variety of food options and the times that in-room food service was available were very disappointing. I would recommend the hotel for business / conventions if the person did not need to rely on room-service.",12-Jun-16,4
"I stayed here on a business trip last February. Booked a club room since it would include breakfast and snacks through the day. First of all, the hotel is old and run down. The check in process was kind of whatever. My only request, checking in so late (around 9pm), was that they would recommend somewhere I could grab an easy dinner. Their response was that I wouldn't find anything because it was Sunday, that I should order room service! This is downtown San Francisco!!! So I decided to venture on my, in spite of their ill advice, and ended up finding (around the block) this fab sushi place. Wish I remembered the name...The breakfast spread was laughable for a hotel that praises itself so highly. Grand Hyatt, not so grand... The snacks during the day were also quite disappointing, I would have rather not booked club room.The rooms are old and not very clean. As to be expected with a Grand Hyatt, the amenities in the bathroom were of very poor quality. At 300+ dollars a night, I would expect better even if that is the brand standard. The windows of the room are very old and let in the cold, they didn't close well. The AC was very loud and stopped me from sleeping well during the night. Overall, I would have been better off staying at another hotel, maybe even the Ritz without the meals would have been better. But I chose the 'comfort' of having the 'lounge'..........",10-Jun-16,2
"Hotel in the Heart of the city,but the price too much for 4 stars ,rooms are clean, Staff very candly, but i dont like this entourage like this hotel,for the smokers is site out the hotel , From this place is near super shops and butics",10-Jun-16,4
"This hotel is excelent . Service , food and friendly sales staff.I am planning to bring large incentive group in November 2017. This is my second time in this hotel and I enjoyed .I do not understand why is requested to write more . I said what I won't in few words.",10-Jun-16,5
Fantastic location as it was within short walking distance to the all the shops and a Starbucks across it. Just really hard to beat! There are notable restaurants nearby the hotel as well. Staff was really friendly. We enjoyed the selections of their breakfast buffet. The beds and pillows...ahhh. We slept like babies for 5 nights. We'll be back most definitely!,9-Jun-16,5
"The location of the hotel was an advantage. We were in easy walking distance to the cable cars, as well as several nice restaurants. The concierge was very helpful with reservations and recommendations.",8-Jun-16,5
"Average food which was expensive, rooms that were old, doors don't seal properly so very noisy. No comforts that you expect when paying over $300 a night (like no robes, no mini bar). I stayed in 2 other hotels in San fran and did not have this same experience. Very disappointing.",8-Jun-16,2
"The Grand Hyatt was very clean and comfortable and was in a great location. The staff was helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I would recommend this hotel for any future visits to downtown San Francisco.",7-Jun-16,5
"Great location. In the heart of all the shopping district (Macy's, Nordstrom, Nike, Louis Vuitton, etc. Walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do and if we didn't want to walk, we were near other transportation options!! Quick check-in/out. Concierge team was great and very helpful. Room 2320 was perfect with a great view. Rooms are quite insulated (minimal to no noise interruption). Bottle of wine & a selection of meat, bread & spread provide for our anniversary.",7-Jun-16,4
Friendly staff and great location. No complaints. Bathroom layout was a little odd. Only a sliding door between dressing area and shower/toilet area. Free internet. We had nice view from the 18th floor.,6-Jun-16,4
"Very modern hotel, with wonderful rooms. Loved the beds, we slept like babies. The restaurant for breakfast is quite good. We stayed on a high floor and had amazing views. The gym was a bit cramped, but had the requisite minimal equipment. The service was very friendly, and helpful.",5-Jun-16,5
"My title sums it up. Love this hotel's location, which is just mins walking distance from the square and major shopping spots and Starbucks and Chinatown at your doorstep. Love the rooms, which are spacious with good fittings. Gym is excellent too My experience at the restaurant, especially for breakfast is usually mixed. Both the service at the restaurant and registration can be better. Its been fairly consistent.... with a 3 star service experience since i first stayed at this hotel in 2013. With some serious focus on upgrading their services, this property can easily be the No 1 in downtown SFO. ",4-Jun-16,5
"San Francisco is one of my favorite cities to work and play. I have stayed in many hotels in SF and the Grand Hyatt is my first choice-always clean, modern, accommodating and the location could not be better. Exit out of the hotel into union square shopping and dining. The Restaurant in the hotel is average at best but the bar is delightful with live music on the weekends and great small bites and drinks. There are so many hotels in San Francisco ranging from downright scary to extraordinary-booking at the Grand Hyatt is your safest bet (if available).",3-Jun-16,5
"Just spent a couple nights at this fine establishment. Rolled in a little late and had some dinner in the lounge. I was greeted by Boa, an amazing bartender and all-around good dude. He told me he has worked at the hotel for 35 years! We chatted and he went out of his way to show me a few things about the city. He left for the night and his replacement Jaime continued the great service.Food was great, drinks were delicious.....all this before I even got to my room. The room was excellent - very modern and truly showcases technology. As it should, since Silicon Valley is very close by.Great location, views were incredible. The staff was very friendly. Price was not cheap, but you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a low-budget hotel, this is not the place. But, if you're willing to pay a little more and have an amazing experience, this is the spot!",2-Jun-16,5
"Although I have been to San Francisco many times and thought there was nothing I hadn't seen or done but I was wrong. The concierge at the Grand Hyatt found amazing shopping experiences that I didn't even know existed (and one of the best meals I have had). It is a rare treat to stay at a ""chain"" hotel that is so exceptional on all levels",2-Jun-16,5
"After an initially shakey start with some costumer care ""issues"" I can honestly say I loved my stay at this hotel. My room was on the 32nd floor overlooking the city sky line and the view didn't disappoint, the hotel itself was very well kept, check in / out was quick and easy and staff were very friendly throughout the hotel. Breakfast was OK - nothing to shout about but it had something for everyone and the buffet allowed you to fill up before a busy day of sightseeing. The hotel is in a great location only a few blocks away from China Town and approximately 25 minutes walk from the Pier 39 / Lombard Street/ Little Italy etc I caught the train from the airport to Union Square (this cost me $9 and the journey lasted 35 minutes and the stop was less then a 10 minute walk from the hotel) I loved my stay here I would definitely recommend this hotel.",1-Jun-16,4
"great location, wonderful staff . comfortable and clean rooms. Grand club food and beverages were excellent . Walking distance from all scenery places. will stay again. very nice staff at the Front desk.",1-Jun-16,5
"Upon check in, I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday. Receptionist greeted and sent a bottle of red wine, strawberries and biscotti to our room. Room was very modern. View was just okay. Amenities and free wifi were appreciated. Concierge in lounge was helping in recommending a tour. Great location to all sites. ",31-May-16,5
"I was in San Francisco for a conference at the Mascone Center. The Grand Hyatt was only about a 5 block walk. It is also only a couple blocks from the Powell cable car which goes down to Fisherman's Wharf. The price is pretty spendy, but, so is everything else in San Francisco.",31-May-16,4
"I would highly recommend this hotel. It was very clean, and everyone there was really nice, and helpful. The concierge was very helpful, and the doorman was always polite. The hotel was at a perfect location for China Town, Little Italy, and Hero's park.",31-May-16,5
"The room was small, but clean and comfortable. We asked for a city view and we're accomodated. Location was great, across the street from Union Square walking distance from several eateries. We recommend Cesarios Itallian. Room service was very pricey. We would consider going back.",31-May-16,4
"Whenever I go to a major city I always look for a Grand Hyatt. There are so few of them the hotels tend to be well done. This is no exception. Great looking hotel and a friendly staff to start. Nice rooms, good flushing toilets, and hot water to follow. Also lets not forget good free wifi everywhere, HDTV with all the jacks, and a great fitness room. Lets add in a great central location. These are all the essentials of a great hotel and the Grand Hyatt San Francisco has them. The one criticism that I have which is a minor one is the club lounge. On my reservation it says that my room will be on a private concierge floor. This was never true and as I rode the elevator to the club lounge level the elevator was full of people like me. Needless to say it was standing room only in the club lounge everytime I was there. It seems the only criteria for the club lounge is to request it. This is a bit dishonest and needs to be reviewed. However this is minor in the scheme of things and I highly recommend this hotel.",30-May-16,4
"The hotel is located in the very convenient place where you can reach to shopping area, china town, business district on foot. The hotel staff is so friendly and helpful. I didnt eat there but there is a restaurant on the second floor. Only negative comment I would is that the hotel guest room",30-May-16,3
"Nicely located, central, near Chinatown. Close enough to the pier that a good walker could walk to it easily. Excellent staff, smiling, knowledgeable, efficient. Only downside : walls are thin, so it is a bit noisy.",29-May-16,4
"I stayed in this property for 3 nights during a business visit in May 2016.the property is very conveniently located next to the union Square and behind the new opened iconic Apple show room. The hotel is conveniently located to most of the major attractions of San Francisco and has excellent connectivity options to various forms of public transport like trams , buses etc. Rooms are good size with modern amenities. Concierge desk is very helpful. Front office staff are also very cooperative and eager to assist. Housekeeping was very good. However the buffet breakfast located on mezzanine level was average and has lot of scope for improvement. Not only do they have a limited choice of items but the breakfast is not worth the charge they levy. Waiters have mastered the art of thrusting the bill on the table even before you are through with half your breakfast as if they want you to leave ASAP. WIFI is complimentary. Doorman is very friendly friendly and helpful. Overall this is a good property and stay is enjoyable. ",28-May-16,4
Grand Hyatt SF is a very nice place to stay when in San Francisco. The hotel has a great location at Union Square and with-in walking distance through the Stockton Street tunnel to North Beach / Little Italy. The staff at all positions was very nice and forthcoming and made the stay even more enjoyable.,28-May-16,5
"Air Condition Vent is very dirty and full with Mold. Room need renovation soon as furniture getting old and need more maintenance in the room. try to avoid Suite soon that next to elevator as you always heard the sound of wind from elevator passing up and down 24 hours . Club Lounge is very small, limited variety of food , Alcohol drink need to pay extra , should not call club lounge at all.",27-May-16,3
Being next to Union square brought the opportunity to see local artist's work when we checked in on Sunday. The Hyatt is an excellent place to stay and explore the delights of San Francisco. The rooms have great views when above the twentieth floor.,26-May-16,5
"Amazing experience overall. Beautiful hotel and superb view of Union Square, city and bay. Hotel staff very friendly, helpful and welcoming. The bed was exceptionally comfortable! Will definitely return to this hotel on my next visit.",26-May-16,5
Very noisy - Saturday night. room was not kept up on the second night stay. You may want to call and insure that the room will be cleaned. The room charge was expensive for what we received. There were other hotels near that would have been better choices,25-May-16,3
Centrally located. Very comfortable rooms - modern but user friendly. Staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. Don't recommend eating in hotel restaurant as is $$$$. Otherwise would definitely stay there again.,24-May-16,5
"When you enter the Grand Hyatt you will meet hotel staff who are trained and very friendly. We were greeted with warm smiles and ""hello""s everywhere in the hotel. The fitness center is well equipped. Centrally located to shopping at Union Square...right next door to the new Apple Store, which was filled with customers. The only disappointing thing is that the street around Union Square is all torn up right now...impacting the ambiance. This Hyatt is definitely a good place to stay.",24-May-16,4
Very happy with my stay. hotel is located in prime location in Union square. close to restaurants and nightlife. Great service and very clean. staff was great also. Parking was pricey but to be expected in the city.,24-May-16,5
The Grand Hyatt San Francisco provided the back drop for a perfect weekend in the city. The staff at the hotel is very professional and fully anticipated any need we had. The room was beautiful and perfectly appointed.,24-May-16,5
"Positives:After arriving from a 20 hour flight at 11:00am, I was very impressed with the Hyatt having a room ready for us! I am so very much appreciative of this and putting overnight travellers first. Room was clean and fantastic city view. We got really cold so had to ask for a second duvet due to the drafts coming into the room.Friendly staff. Internet was good.  Negatives:No water in roomsLimited tea and coffee No milk providedThe port on the radio does not workBalcony and front door there is gaps which creates drafts and makes the room cold. No slippers provided until asked forNo toothbrushes provided (luckily we brought our own)Tip - bring toothbrushes and also if you are a light sleeper, you might want to go elsewhere as there is currently construction which you can hear. Luckily we are heavy sleepers and were on a high level so didn't hear too much. ",23-May-16,3
"Location of this hotel was perfect, right in the middle of everything. Only stayed at this hotel for one night, was more than pleased with the service we received. Payed for valet parking which was easier than finding our own parking and then carrying all our luggage to the hotel. This wasn't much more in price than the regular self parking and made life a lot easier. Free WiFi in rooms and areas of the hotel.Had the buffet breakfast in the restaurant which was expensive but was plenty of things to have.Defiantly recommended and well worth the price.",23-May-16,5
"Truthfully, I had a horrible time at this hotel. I couldnâ€™t wait to get out of there and wouldnâ€™t recommend anyone to stay there for FREE. Parking was cluster. Gentlemen by the name Nichola (in the garage) was extremely rude and had no customer service skills whatsoever. The room was overpriced if you ask me. Dust was everywhere and specially in the hallway between a wall and the lamp (didnâ€™t look like it was ever dusted there). I had to clean it up because my wife is allergic to dust. There were 4 people in the room but we only had 2 sets of towels. I asked 2 different people at the front desk about location of my seminar (Roper Export Compliance) and they couldnâ€™t find it in the computer. Then they sent me to look at the monitor by the elevators for the events so I told them that I already looked there and my seminar wasnâ€™t there. Both individuals gave me an attitude and wanted to see for themselves. When they realized thereâ€™s no Roper seminar they had a nerve to ask me if Iâ€™m in the right hotel. I was told there will be signs everywhere to guide me to the right room downstairs. Next day I went down and there were several signs but for different events and none for my seminar. Iâ€™ve met 4 more people, who was looking for the same seminar and they actually had to call our corporate office just to confirm that the seminar is in this hotel (we spent about 20 min looking for the room). Then during first 2 hours of the seminar we had to listen the construction going on upstairs. Our coordinator had to call twice because we couldnâ€™t hear the speaker. We stayed in Westin last year and what a service and hotel compare to this one. Iâ€™ve been going to these seminars every year for the past 15 years or so and never experienced hell hole like this hotel. I did have a good time after I moved to another hotel and enjoyed my time in San Francisco.",23-May-16,1
"We checked in on Saturday morning while the flagship Apple Store next door was being opened, it was a very happy atmosphere & did not detract from the efficiency & friendliness of the front desk staff. The location is great. Our room on the 27th floor offered great views of Union Square and beyond. The concierge offered us many useful suggestions for dinner and on getting tickets for the Giants game.",23-May-16,5
"We had a large group here for one night. We didn't use many of the accommodations besides the rooms, but the rooms were great. Clean, quiet, clean bathrooms. The location for us (went to see baseball game) was excellent. One oddity which seems to be a trend is the ""sliding door"" to the bathroom, similar to a barn door that's big in home renovations - it slides, but doesn't latch. It's not quite private. It's an odd feature that you can't even latch the bathroom door. Other than that we enjoyed the room, with a decent view. We were on the 12th floor. They did mess up the billing for us, but it was just billed to the wrong card, not an actual discrepancy in the amount. Overall a good stay I'd consider coming back.",23-May-16,4
"The hotel is superb, location at Union Square excellent, except for the massive construction, quiet and comfortable rooms and the service is extraordinary. Special thank you shout out to Steve at the front desk, Shari Wellington in reservations, and David Chew in the club lounge.",23-May-16,5
"I generally like the location, the property, the staff and the amenities as this location. I also am very easy to please and usually on business so less likely to use the amenities other than the bar and gym, yet both are very good. I would describe this property as a safe bet other than the one instance it was very windy and my hotel room creaked.",23-May-16,4
"Convenient and central location in Union Square. We had a king room on the 25th floor, nice size room, comfortable bed, newly renovated, bathroom on the larger side with plenty of counter space. No mini bar or even bottled water in the room. My only complaints about the room were the low-flow shower head (weak water pressure, but I get it, eco-friendly San Fran), and the sliding bathroom door that all hotels seem to be implementing. Who is leading hotel developers to think that privacy is not a desired quality in a bathroom? There was still construction on the street but we had the quiet side of the building and you could almost hear a pin drop. Unexpectedly quiet. We tried the bar which was unremarkable but shame it was only on the 2nd floor with the great view up top they could be using. Overall a good stay.",22-May-16,4
The Grand Hyatt SF is a great hotel in the center of union square. It's the perfect location for walking to shopping and restaurants and it's pretty close to everywhere in the city. I love this part of SF because I love the shopping by it and it's cole proximity to almost everywhere in the city. The rooms are nice and spacious and the service is great. We know stay at this hotel every time we are in SF because we have had such great experiences there every time. It's also very festive around the holidays :)),22-May-16,5
"Well located in downtown San Francisco with good restaurants in very close location. The hotel is very well maintained, clean and all of the staff were very prompt to take care of whatever needs I had.",22-May-16,5
"the service provided by the personnel was perfect and charming. Although it is a large hotel you felt at home. The room was also great with (in our room) a awesome view. Incredible! Only minor issues were less perfect. In my view a hotel with such a standard should serve a much better breakfast with salads, real fresh orange juice and really perfect strong, tasteful coffee. Now it was too much of an american style although such a hotel is a melting pot of the world and is located in San Francisco. Again, these were only minor remarks",22-May-16,4
"Grabbed a quick drink and a slider after a long flight, not bad at all, but not a place to spend the evening.Beef sliders good and tasty.Deco was dated, a good drop if you just want to be in and out.Hyatt should try to keep sharp in there concepts.",21-May-16,3
"I was asked upon check-in to change from 2 doubles to a king room. Little did I realize this put me directly above the 24 hour a day heavy construction. 3 nights with no more than 3 hours of sleep per night and a complete unwillingness of the front desk to find quieter accommodations.Add to that, a big ball of someone else's hair in the closet upon arrival.Modern and pretty cool., streamlined rooms, but dirty and unwilling to find me a place where I could get sleep. I'm not very happy.On a plus side, the concierge was wonderful!",21-May-16,2
"Construction work (banging and beeping) outside the hotel into the night meant I did not get a good nights sleep whilst staying here. Otherwise, the staff were friendly, bed and room comfortable and food in One Up good.",21-May-16,4
"This is a fine hotel in what would ordinarily be a great location in Union Square. Unfortunately, there was construction going on 24 hours per day immediately next to the hotel (Apple Store) and Stockton Street is under construction as well. It's incredible that the city would allow construction to occur through the wee hours of the morning (weekends included), and hotel makes no mention of what's going on in the neighborhood. We heard hammering, banging, trucks unloading/dumping materials, etc. throughout the night. Unless you are a very sound sleeper who is completely unperturbed by LOUD construction noise, STAY AWAY until the construction is over.",20-May-16,3
"This is an outstanding hotel in the midst of a lively San Francisco with the nearby shopping, bars and clubs. The room was quite nice with two beds, a flat-screen TV and gorgeous bathroom containing a big shower with hot water and good water pressure at all times. The decor was new and pleasing. We had a good view and particularly appreciated the automated black-out blinds. With the click of a button, we had a peaceful dark room in which to sleep at any hour. It was also quiet, as we never heard any noise from neighboring rooms.The check-in was quick and professional and every time we had a question (and we had several), they were perfectly polite, friendly and efficient. The concierge gave us a map highlighted with all the areas we wanted to see with the most efficient ways to get there. (Twice... we lost the first one). Room service was awesome - the food delicious and beautifully presented.The breakfast buffet at the One Up restaurant was very good with a selection of different flavors of scrambled eggs every day, bacon, pan-fried potatoes and a wide variety of fresh fruit, yogurt and cheeses.At the time, the building next door was under construction but we were never inconvenienced in any way. The 24-hour police presence near the front door was even welcome, as the guests could feel safe coming in at any hour of the night.",20-May-16,5
Ideal location. Great hotel. Great room. Good gym at the 35th floor (great view of the bay). Breakfast counter with Starbuck coffee. Standard internet is really reliable and streaming is easily possible. There is construction on the Union Square unfortunately... Only disagreement.,20-May-16,5
"I called ahead of time to let the Front Office team know I was proposing to my GF that day. After speaking to Ashley at the Front Desk, she set us up in a very nice room, high floor and wonderful view. Thank you to Shannon at the Front Desk as well for a very nice check-in experience. There was a lovely amenity waiting for us with well wishes and congrats on the big day. Thank you to the Front Desk team for making my special day even more special. I'll be back!",19-May-16,5
"I normally stay at the Hyatt Embarcadero (since it's close to work) but thought I'd try a change of scenery this time. The Grand Hyatt is not only in the perfect location for some great bars, restaurants and of course smack in the middle of the shopping district but also one of the more modernly finished Hyatts in the city. My room was bright, spacious with simple modern furniture. The staff both at check in and check were incredibly welcoming and very helpful.I rated the hotel down for 2 reasons. Firstly after flying for 16 hrs to San Fransisco I was feeling jet lagged so stayed in the hotel and ate at the One Up restaurant. I ordered the short ribs and the meat tasted so bad I couldn't eat it. The second reason was due to the handling charges for some deliveries I had. I purchased a range of products from Amazon which got delivered separately for speed of delivery. The hotel charged me $5 each time a package arrived, so I ended up paying $25 in total..not a huge amount but I find it ludicrous they charge this for their customers and for each package (vs just once per stay) and especially for a Platinum member of their loyalty program! Both of these left a bad taste in my mouth in what otherwise would have been a great stay",18-May-16,3
"The hotel was ok. This is the first time I stayed at this Hyatt in Union Square. The location was convenient. There was nothing wonderful about this hotel. I rather stay at the Hyatt at Embacadero, which is a much better hotel.",18-May-16,3
"The rooms were standard Hyatt rooms which are always nice, clean and roomy. This is a great location as it's close to Union Square, shopping and tons or restaurants. The bar area is quite large and a nice place to meet up of drinks.",18-May-16,4
"From front drive to back of the house is excellent . Front desk staff are very friendly and helpful . Got in our room early and we feel lucky . Great amenities including for an 8 months old granddaughter Aria . The Executive housekeeper made sure everything is ready upon arrival . This is really an exceptional service that we can't thank enough . Regency Club is very clean and organize , staff very friendly as always . Good and fresh fruits , hot coffee and tea serves all day . Once again , Thank you Hyatt and staff .",18-May-16,5
"Stayed here for the third time. Definitely has been renovated since my last stay. Rooms are very nice and modern. Good gym and nice lobby. Great location next to Union square and shopping. Now that the Mandarin is gone, this will by go to SF hotel.",18-May-16,5
"Last minute trip required overnight stay and I am really happy that it resulted in a stay at this place. Great atmosphere, quiet rooms and wonderful staff. I didn't arrive until after midnight after a full day of airports but the desk staff was cheerful and happy to help me get someone to help me with my bags to my room (usually I have to ask but they anticipated the need). They also waived the valet parking fee and helped me with directions the next day. The view left a lot to be desired but I was there on business not pleasure so to me it has no bearing on this review.I will be back to this place not only for the awesome staff but also for the wonderful quiet atmosphere.",17-May-16,5
"Very central, clean, modern and excellent customer service. The television in our room was on as we entered with a greeting personalized to us. Bed was comfortable and room was very well maintained. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend. ",17-May-16,5
"from the first contact with the men outside to the check in, to the bellman, everything was outstanding. one of the best hotels we have ever stayed overnighted in san Francisco. you cannot go wrong with this property, they do things right",17-May-16,5
"We arrived on April 27 and checked into a 4th floor room facing an active construction zone right outside the window. Thankfully construction did not start in earnest until early the next morning. We worked with the check-in agents who got creative and were able to move us to an east-facing room on the 26th floor.The room was spacious and well maintained, relatively quiet, with a nice view toward the Bay. Service through our entire stay was excellent. We also appreciated quick access to the BART and bus lines for day trips around town. Nice amenities too, including a 24-hour gym with filtered water and a sweeping view.We'll certainly consider staying here again on future trips to the Bay Area.",17-May-16,4
"Stayed 3 nights in beautiful SF with our family and although we love union square, right now it is too hectic. There is so much construction going on in the area it is just too noisy to sleep. I could hear the elevator gong up and down all night long as well as the back up beeping from the construction site vehiclesright outside the hotel. It is a shame because the hotel is lovely but not relaxing. A good night sleep is needed when you travel across the country but that was just not happening. I would consider going back to the Hyatt but only once the construction next door is done.",17-May-16,3
The hotel was great as usual. We always stay at the Grand Hyatt when in San Francisco. The weather was good and the service at the hotel was excellent. The food in the hotel was of good quality and we had dinner and breakfast at the hotel The location is good if a person wants to shop or be in the city. Best to park your car at the hotel and take a taxi. .,17-May-16,5
"We stayed for two nights but could not bear the construction noises around the clock. We could not sleep for the entire stay. Worse yet, nothing about the noise had been mentioned to us before, during and after the stay. We raised issues to the management but no one reached out to us despite the fact that they promised several times that someone would call us to address the issues.",17-May-16,2
Has the best meeting at Grand Hyatt. My coordinator provided exceptional service. Everyone who attended our meeting had nothing but great things to say about the view from our meeting room and the food.,16-May-16,5
"I recently stayed here for four nights for a trip to meet friends. It is definitely feels like a large convention style hotel and very posh. Location is excellent if you need to be near Union Square - away from the main bustle, but close walk to the square, Chinatown, cable cars.The lobby is pristine, with plenty of spots for sitting. There is a cute cafe, but also conveniently a Starbucks across the way for coffee. The bell staff were always welcoming me back, and the concierge was very helpful with maps/directions.The best part was being able to have an early checkin (I arrived in the morning)! Very much appreciated.The biggest downside was the room itself. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable, but there was a weird smell to the room (vinegary, like someone left a salad with dressing out). The smell cleared when I opened the window, but would come quickly back when the window was closed. I'm not sure if I was near the kitchen? It's my fault for not calling and changing rooms to one without an odor - after my stay, I was emailed a survey and the manager answered my concerns - I think they would have been very accommodating. (I didn't change rooms because I felt too lucky to have received an early check-in and didn't want to seem ungrateful. stupid, I know!)Minor things - no newspapers were delivered to the door. Instead there was usually a pile near the elevator, though one morning, they were gone by 9am. A dirty washrag was hanging in the shower. Room was also next to a staff closet/room, there was a period of time when I was working from the room in the afternoon and heard that door opening/closing (loudly) constantly. Great bathroom amenities, including ear plugs. Note there is construction going on outside, blocking a portion of the sidewalk/road outside the hotel. Nothing that can't be worked around, just awkward to break the barrier every time you wanted to go through the main entrance and made it a little tricky for drivers!",16-May-16,3
"Staff was very nice and helpful. Good location to Union Plaza, which isn't much but an open area in the middle of a very busy city. One street over from Powell which is a very cool street with restaurants, shops and the main cable car street. Good views of the city from our room.I understand that everything is over priced in San Francisco but to pay over $300 which is discounted due to a corporate event is ridiculous. Had a burger one evening at the One Up bar. Not great, save your burger night for Burger Bar at Macy's.If you must stay here wait until the construction of a huge flagship Apple Store is complete next door. They have a 24 hour construction permit. We stayed 4 nights on the 16th floor and were up all night on one of the louder and busier nights.",15-May-16,3
"My mom Luz had been wanting to spend the night in San Francisco for years now. Her birthday was coming up in a couple of days. I though this stay would be a great way to surprise her and combine her birthday with mothers day present. This became her mothers day, wish come true.",15-May-16,5
"My son and I stayed here over Mother's Day weekend. The location is fantastic--right in Union Square and walking distance from both amazing shopping and wonderful restaurants. The rooms are beautiful, spotless, well-appointed, and boast some incredible views from the top floors. The beds are some of the most comfortable I've experienced in any top hotel. Best of all is the service--everyone you meet from the first minute of your arrival is there to help in any way possible. The concierges are beyond accomodating and will help you plan a perfect touring day in the city, or just recommend a great place to eat. Will definitely stay here the next time we visit!!",14-May-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt interior is an updated contemporary design, including the reception and lobby area. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable; however get a room as far away from the central elevator shafts as possible for less elevator noise. Valet Parking is the expected $67 per day-but arriving late Friday afternoon can be chaotic. Do not bring a pet. While the GH is listed as pet friendly, but digging down into the website you find there is a $100 per stay charge for up to 6 days. Being advised at checkin is too late. The Westin St Francis has no pet charge.",14-May-16,5
"Nice hotel, right on Union Square, accessible to the heart of San Francisco and all of her attractions. The Grand Hyatt is exactly what you would expect from a Hyatt. It is clean and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful. Its just so very formulaic. So if that's your thing, don't think twice and stay here!",14-May-16,4
"Our first impression as we drove in: ""Valet is $59/day & Self-Park at a garage a block away is $34/day."" We turned our rental car in the next day as we didn't need it! The atrium is vast & beautiful! Rooms are neat/nice. Our sliding door view was of the bay but we couldn't see it from our bed. The decor on each floor is plain. Overall experience was positive.",13-May-16,4
"We usually stay at the W San Francisco but decided to check out the Grand Hyatt. We were deeply disappointed. Our room was old, the door was all scratched up and the trash cans were all rusty (very visible). It felt like staying in an Embassy Suites than a high end luxury hotel. We also had a bad experience with very loud neighbors at 2:30am and it took 3 calls over a 15-20 minute period before security was dispatched. Wasted my Gold Passport points for the room and was totally disappointed.",12-May-16,1
"San Fran is a beautiful city, during my one week business trip in this great city, I never regret to choose Grand Hyatt for my stay. Very friendly staffs, served great food especially breakfast. Location is superb and I truly enjoyed all the facilities in the hotel.",11-May-16,4
"Stayed here for 2 nights with my husband on vacation. There is construction next door on an Apple store. We requested a room far from the noise and our room was quiet. Service here is good. The bar is nice. Location is good if you want to walk to nearby tourist places, shopping mall, Muni to see other parts of the city. Room was very comfortable and clean.",11-May-16,4
"Chose the hotel for its location at Union Square, in the heart of the shopping district of the touristy city. Stayed for two nights.The hotel is situated between Union Square and the Chinatown Dragon Gate along Grant Street.Check-in by a friendly staff was a breeze upon arrival.The room and bathroom were clean and well-maintained. Pillows were good.The lady at the concierge was also very helpful when we enquired about transport to the airport.There's some construction work going on beside the hotel on north edge of Union Square. So there could be some noise starting early morning. But I found that not to be a big nuisance.One peeve was a Chinese-looking house-keeping staff knocking rudely on the two mornings I stayed. She retorted rudely I did not hang the DND sign when I complained about the way she knocked at 8:30am. Don't think she should even belong at this fine hotel.We thoroughly enjoyed the shopping around the area, and taking in sights of the lovely city. The Powell street cable car terminal is within walking distance nearby.",11-May-16,5
"It's what you would expect, clean and was a fine for us. The breakfast buffet was a little repetitive, but was okay. It's really near Union Square and close to high end shopping and a short walk to the local mall. There was a Bubble tea place out the front to the left of the main entrance, just before the tunnel, which was nice as girlfriend loves her Bubble tea.",11-May-16,4
"We were met after a long day of travel by a friendly and most helpful employee who gave us an upgraded corner room. The Grand Hyatt is clean, updated, modern with super friendly staff, free wifi and in a fabulous location. I would have rated it 5 stars if they had bathrobes in the closet. If you choose to stay here be sure to pack one!",10-May-16,4
When we arrived we were told that no King rooms were available at present and they had a room with two queen beds that was slightly disappointing as we had booked a King room. We could have waited a few hours but it was past check in time and just wanted to get settled.They offered to change our room the next day but in the end we couldn't be bothered to moved. We had a lovely view with a clean and comfy room. The location is fantastic and we walked everywhere.,10-May-16,4
"I've stayed at numerous hotels in SF, but this was my first stay at the Grand Hyatt. I was expecting a well-worn tourist hotel, but was surprised at how updated it is. It's very clean, and our room looked like something out of Architectural Digest Magazine. The carpet was clean, the furniture was new, and the bathroom looked brand new. The black out drapes operate via a button near the bed...it was like something out of Cribs. In terms of location, you are half a block from Union Square and one block to the Cable Car line. You could not be in a better location. As of May 2016, construction is going on next door for the new Apple Store, and the street in front of the hotel is half blocked. This makes for some interesting arrivals, as there is hardly anywhere to stop and drop off luggage. However, they have numerous staff outside to assist and even an on duty policeman. I've stayed in the other Hyatts in SF, two Marriotts, the St. Francis and the Hilton and this is hands down the best.",9-May-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is everything you expect from a Hyatt hotel. It has all the amenities, great location near Union Square and high end shopping and not too far from convention center. Unfortunately, the construction on Stockton for the subway was load and I wasn't able to sleep in to 6 am. It'll be the perfect everything once construction is complete.",9-May-16,4
We had an amazing experience at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. We booked a room on the 30th floor (Grand Club Floor) and got an incredible view of the city. We also had access to the Grand Club lounge where the food selection was good. Front desk receptionists and valet services were great as well. Everyone was welcoming and courteous. We're definitely going back!,9-May-16,5
"If you don't mind spending a little more , then this is a perfect location to be . Near Union Square. It's close to high end shopping . Lots of restaurants and inexpensive diners close by too. It's easy to flag a taxi. And the hotel ...it's customer service to the cozy lounge and room, no complaints. ",8-May-16,5
"The Hyatt in Union Square was a perfect location for shopping, dining and people watching. AND they are building a brand new Apple store next door. convenient . The staff is friendly, the hotel is top notch and cable cars are right around the corner. Excellent getaway hotel.",6-May-16,5
All positive other than crowded fitness room footprint (would be forgivable given dramatic view if windows had thermal protection/tint to keep out afternoon sun) and NO IN-ROOM COFFEE. High-end hotel shouldn't try to force the coffee bar upsell.,5-May-16,4
"Had a recent 4 night stay here in a standard bay view room. The hotel is in the perfect location, right on Union Square and easy walking to many restaurants and shops. We did have a car when we arrived but after finding out how expensive parking was, we returned it and walked / caught transport everywhere.Our room was large and modern. Loved the remote blinds which I could put up and down from the comfort of my bed! The bed itself was very comfortable. The bathroom is small, and has a (tiny) shower over bath. In a hotel of this standard, a stand alone shower would be much better. Had a few issues with slow or non-existent service with housekeeping but they were cleared up quickly. There are roadworks going outside the hotel which cause a bit of chaos at the front of the hotel but they couldn't be heard from inside the hotel.Had breakfast in the restaurant and the food was delicious. But given the location of the hotel, we chose to eat out locally instead most of the time.",4-May-16,4
"Nice room, friendly and helpful staff, convenient for down town business. Some nice features like electric shades and built in reading lights on the bed head board; however not great for extended stay as the mini fridges don't have freezers, there are no microwaves in the rooms, no complimentary WFI and no swimming pool. For the price I would expect more than just a nice room with a good view of the city. Also the walls are thin and you hear doors slamming at all hours and there is a lot of light leakage under the bottoms of the doors as there are no door thresholds to help seal the room. I used a towel to block the light.",4-May-16,4
"My family of four (two adults and a 11 and nine year old) stayed here for four nights in a family room. We found the hotel well located; right across the road from Union Square and close to public transport (including the world famous cable cars) and restaurants. I really appreciated the hotel's fitness centre which had a very good range of cardio equipment and weights. Hotel staff were friendly and happy to provide assistance in how to get to tourist locations. The hotel was clean and nicely maintained. The only slight downside was the beds which seemed a little smaller than normal, which was noticed as we had to share the two beds between our family. ",3-May-16,4
"I stayed here for 3 nights with my Mom and her friend at the start of our week long ladies getaway. We enjoyed the location of the hotel and found plenty of shops and restaurants in the area to keep us entertained when we were not sightseeing. The hotel itself is very large and modern, and we were assigned a room on a high floor with a great view of the San Francisco skyline. The room looked liked it had recently been updated, and it had all the modern bells and whistles like remote controlled blinds. The bathroom was also very modern with a large bowl style sink and beautiful tile backsplash in the shower. The room and bathroom were spotless, and the maid always left extra June Jacobs bath amenities, which we all loved. Since I was staying as a guest of honor under a Diamond GP member, the hotel sent up a beautiful fruit platter and bottle of champagne upon arrival. We also had access to the Grand Club and thoroughly enjoyed having breakfast with a beautiful view of the city. very morning The hospitality of the lounge staff was also top notch, and they really went over and above to make our time in the lounge pleasant. My Mom and I also used the gym, which though often crowded, provided a wonderful view of the city. It had plenty of cardio and strength training equipment, and staff were coming by frequently to clean and replenish the towels.I have stayed at quite a few Hyatt properties, and this is probably the best Hyatt I have stayed in the lower 48 with regards to the friendliness of the staff, hotel location, and amenities. I would not hesitate to return.",1-May-16,5
Grand Hyatt is very well located near the financial district. It is also close to tourist spots. Rooms have modern amenities and common areas are well maintained. Checking in and out is very smooth process. Had a good dining facility. Employees are very efficient. ,29-Apr-16,4
"I had a lovely time at this hotel. Very clean and nice room. I requested a crib before arrival and they had one waiting in the room. Lots of stuff to do around the area, great for walking around. You get that ""New York City"" feeling in SF. One word of caution: the valet staff stole $20 bucks I had in my ashtray. Kinda my fault for leaving it there but don't leave anything in the car before giving it to the valet. Overall a very nice stay.",29-Apr-16,5
"I travel quite a bit for work and have stayed at this particular property nearly 20 times spanning over a 10-12 year period. This hotel is honestly one of my favorite places to stay when I am in the Bay area primarily because of the staff. From the maid service to the front desk to the concierge everyone always goes above and beyond. As someone who is on the road quite a bit, I also was impressed post renovation that the rooms were very well thought out (my colleagues and I all agreed it must have been a woman :)) The placement of plugs, reading lights, closets beside the bathroom, etc. makes for a comfortable and convenient stay. Well done! I used to alternate between the Hyatt and the Fairmont (for their incredible bay views), but I think my most recent stay at the Hyatt may have converted me to stay only at this property. I would be amiss not to mention the Grand Club level offerings and particularly the staff. They are some of the best I've experienced!",29-Apr-16,5
"From the doormen to the housekeepers everyone is friendly and helpful. Great bedding, clean comfortable rooms, bar is nice and friendly. Checkin easy and concierge was amazing. Close to everything, and easy to get to.",28-Apr-16,5
"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt many times. It is superbly located and has excellent facilities. I made a last minute reservation, and everything was in order. The staff was excellent. The room was quiet and is excellent for a business guest.",28-Apr-16,4
"Hotel room and service has been good. Location is good with easy access to shops, cable car, China Town etc. Free Wifi or should I say Wifi included was critical to help plan things to do. We have especially been impressed with the concierge service from Joanna who has been exceptional-good job. ",27-Apr-16,4
"Check in was a little confusing because there are independent kiosks for each front desk person rather than one long counter, so we walked around a bit before returning to the reception area (to the right upon entrance). The gentleman who helped us let us check in early and gave us helpful hints for our stay. The room was great with modern finishes, an awesome view of the city and one of the most comfortable king sized beds we've ever experienced. One thing I would change is the bathroom door. Though trendy, I am not a fan of the sliding door because it doesn't block the sound of restroom use from the living space. Not too romantic if you ask me. Otherwise, the restroom came equipped with all the amenities and great water pressure.Free wi-fi throughout the hotel. The lobby and restaurant looked like museums. They gym has state-of-the-art equipment, both cardio and weight training machines. Tip: the gym is on the 35th floor and because it is east facing, gets pretty warm in the mornings; Friday afternoon workout was much less crowded and hot than Saturday morning. Either way the view is incredible. There is no pool, but it was freezing out so we didn't miss it. There is a Starbucks right across the street, but they also serve Starbucks coffee in the lobby each morning. Fewer people and the girls who helped us were super nice. Though we'd made other plans, the restaurant lounge has live music Friday and Saturday night. As far as location goes, it was walking distance from anything we needed and we enjoyed our coffee at Union Square. The only bummer was that between the hotel and the square there was some pretty heavy duty construction happening, which could be heard throughout our stay (beeping trucks and jackhammers), and some of the sidewalks were blocked. All in all, a wonderful experience. Beautiful room, great location and friendly staff. We'd definitely stay there again.",27-Apr-16,4
"The neighborhood is safe & Nice.. The valet parking is a little over priced but the service is top notch, you can text them and they have your car downstairs ready and waiting! I highly recommend the club level package! The view is amazing and the food is better than most. I wouldn't recommend dinner at the club level but breakfast and their snacks + free drinks are plenty and generous. I found the staff extremely professional and courteous and they won me over with their charm. I will be staying at this hotel when I am in for business from now on! Check out a couple pictures I took of the suite. The bathroom was bigger than most SF hotel rooms!",27-Apr-16,5
Had a very nice stay at the Grand Hyatt. Check-in staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was quite nice with an amazing view and the bed was super comfortable. I wish that I had asked what the brand/style the bed was . . . I'm in the new for a new mattress!,26-Apr-16,5
"Very clean and very beautiful hotel. Staff was some of the best I have encountered and I travel a lot. But if you book this hotel remember you are in the middle of a major city- and it is noisy at all hours (and we were on the 23rd floor). Nothing Hyatt can do about the cars honking and ambulance sirens, but I just thought I could help manage expectations for those ready to book. If you do want to stay in the city, it is a great choice. Steps from China Town and the end of the cable car line. If I stay in the city I will stay here again.",26-Apr-16,4
"This was our third or forth stay in this hotel and by far the worst. Our room was really small comparatively with a horrible view in a terrible location in the hotel. We asked 5 times for a different room nicely. We checked in early so it should not have been a problem. We stayed here for an anniversary celebration and this made our stay pretty bad. One of the people who we spoke with about changing the room was straight up rude. We were willing to pay up to $100 for an upgrade, we just wanted a decent room. After our last effort to switch rooms we went back to our crappy room and the maids were in the supply closet that was next to our room (both were at the end of the hall) with the door open and the cart blocking our door. This really made us feel like the Hyatt couldn't care less about us as guests in the hotel. At this time I called down and really complained as this was ruining our romantic get away. The man I spoke with was really helpful and tried to get us a better room but by this time most guests had checked in for the night, so rooms were slim pickings. He gave us a similar room with a slightly better view but it still wasn't really that great. He also gave us a comp in the bar for our inconvenience but I feel all of it was a lot of trouble for a slightly better room. There are a lot of hotels in Union Square and I don't think I would stay here again.",26-Apr-16,3
"This hotel was awesome. The location was great, the staff was great and our room was great. The concierge's were very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. They never steered us in the wrong direction and were very friendly. I will stay here again when I make it back.",26-Apr-16,5
Great view and friendly staff. From check-in to check-out it was a great experience. They go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. Hotel is nicely located since you are right next to union square shopping and you can also walk to fisherman's wharf or china town.,26-Apr-16,4
"This is a very nice hotel. The rooms are large with updated decor. The hotel is near a lot of high end shops and close to restaurants. The bar is lively with a fine wine list and beer selection. There was a lot of street construction during my stay but that should not worry anyone who plans to walk the city. The only complaint would be their TV system, it's very strange. I could not get NBC one night and this morning I could not get ABC.",25-Apr-16,4
"The Grand Hyatt is in a great spot. Just outside of Chinatown, we were able to walk to everything in the city. And for those days when everyone was tired, the cable car and street car are close by. The suites are huge! We had a one bedroom suite with a large living room/office and 2 full baths. Would definitely stay again. ",25-Apr-16,4
"Have stayed here couple of times. ItÂ´s a nice hotel with great rooms, amazing view over the city and very helpful staff. Ask for room with overview over the city center if possible.Unfortunately the 36 floor was closed at my rescent stay.",25-Apr-16,4
"All Staff I encountered whether on the reception desk, conceirge, doormen or in the breakfast restaurant were helpful. The room was spacious with a big bed and very effective black out blinds. The lounge chair was comfortable and it was good to have an iron and ironing board available in the room. The sink in the bathroom looked large enough to wash a baby in it, but the shower didn't have the best water pressure. I borrowed a dressing gown from housekeeping which was delivered immediately along with slippers and the mouthwash I had requested. The restrooms on the lower level had neon sinks and a TV on the mirror which was funky but weird.The location just around the corner from Union Square was great - there are currently roadworks outside however this didn't impact my stay & I couldn't hear any construction noise from my room. The breakfast was ok with attentive service (even for the buffet). The food choice was ok too but there are cheaper options nearby. ",24-Apr-16,4
"I've stayed here about 10 nights over the past three years. The hotel is a half block from Union Square but it's slightly affected by construction. It's a well run Grand Hyatt with updated and comfortable rooms. There are a mix of conference rooms downstairs and the event room at the top of the hotel is quite nice. Overall, it's a good choice for the area, especially when their rates are lower. When it's busy, the rates can get absurd.",23-Apr-16,5
My mother and I truly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt. It is centrally located and the property is modern and clean. The staff readily accommodated our requests and gave us plenty of information about the surrounding area.,23-Apr-16,5
"We could not have asked for a more perfect weekend for our Girls Weekend Out! San Francisco weather was a wonderful surprise in that it was WARM and CLEAR the whole time we were there! The hotel amenities was perfect for us - the staff so warm and helpful - we were even joking with them! We had the 33rd floor and had an incredible view! The Hyatt Club was just wonderful - the breakfast was the best - scrambled eggs and all the toppings to add that you can think of, plus oatmeal, muffins, Danish, bagels and lox, toasts, fresh fruits and juices and coffees and teas! And cold beverages to choose as well. I would strongly recommend this hotel - it's also a great location for restaurants and shopping. It was a perfect weekend for us galpals!",23-Apr-16,5
"This hotel is situated in a wonderful location, friendly staff, and close to all the top department stores and small boutique shops. However, rooms are dated and in need of refurbishment. Great for any one looking for a centrally located hotel in city centre. ",23-Apr-16,3
"Nice hotel, good location etc etc per the other reviews. But you either get a good view or as in our case a view of the car park....and pay the same price. I asked for a room change and wasn't met with a positive response. Disappointing honeymoon experience where you expect to be wowed at this price. Reception staff were nice but yet to crack a smile from staff at the front door. Have stayed at many Hyatt's around the world and this is the only one I will leave feeling underwhelmed.",22-Apr-16,2
"one of the best Grand Hyatt in the US with outstanding concierge who seems to be able to get you into the coolest restaurants. (eg: Chez Panisse). The hotel is mature and currently being disrupted by the construction of the new subway, it is a great location, very welcoming and the rooms are very good",22-Apr-16,5
"We've stayed at this property before, but it has been updated (very nicely, I might add) so we were confident in our choice prior to arrival. But then - we received an email from the hotel staff the day before our arrival regarding our child (age, etc.) and upon arrival the room was equipped with not only the crib we requested but an infant bath, bottle brush, dish soap (for bottles), diaper genie (!!!!) baby bath kit and baby blanket. Plus, everything was spotlessly cleaned when we arrived - early, I might add. The staff could not have been more friendly and accommodating with our excessive luggage and gear and special requests (note: we booked 2 adjoining rooms to spread out and we tried very hard to be unobtrusive to the non-family travelers in the hotel). We were in Northern California for 10 days, and stayed at 4 Hyatts - I have to say they were all accommodating but this Hyatt is absolutely the best if you are traveling with an infant or young child.",22-Apr-16,5
"This was my first time at the Grand Hyatt in SF and itâ€™s a very modern and comfortable property at Union Square. My room was on a high floor and at the end of the hall which is generally a good location. It isnâ€™t here. The doors to the rooms on either side of me were inches away from mine. Needless to say any time my neighbors arrived/left/chatted briefly in the hall it felt like they were in my room. When I opened the door I was a little shocked by the hardwood floors. I thought it was interesting but then also made the room feel more cold and certainly more loud as I walked around.The room was a unique shape and I enjoyed that it was different than the usual set up. There was a small hallway next to the bed that contained the closet and the entryway to the bathroom. The closet was large inside but the doors were so small. In order to get the ironing board in the closet I had to almost climb in to get it. Most of the space in there was inconvenient and unusable.The wood accent around the TV and the desk, and nightstand look good from a distance but up close show a lot of nicks in the wood. Iâ€™m not sure that was the best choice. Also, the decorative window screens held in place with Velcro didnâ€™t stay in place and consistently were askew. However, the bed was comfortable, the shower worked well and the view from the room was nice since I was up so high. I also had access to the club a few levels up. That was a nice feature to grab something to drink whenever I needed anything. I donâ€™t know if I would stay here again but with so many great hotels in SF I certainly donâ€™t need to. I just donâ€™t think this hotel was for me. The lobby space and seating were a lot more inviting and comfortable than my room unfortunately.",22-Apr-16,3
"Just stayed and had a room on a high floor with an amazing view of the city & bay. Great location, close to union square, Chinatown, restaurants, and cable cars. Beds very comfortable, nice furnishings, staff nice. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is room is on the smaller side, window wouldn't open at all for fresh air, and the coffee in the room wasn't any good. Other than that, no complaints.",21-Apr-16,4
"Great location for first time visitors to San Francisco. Located on a corner of Union Square for easy walking access to primary stores, restaurants and trolley lines. Sleek, modern, easy check-in. Rooms have been recently updated with sliding doors to outside that actually open slightly allowing for fresh air. Views from upper floor rooms are outstanding, especially those overlooking bay.Recommend you book lounge access. Very accommodating staff. Breakfast spread is nice - great to drop in anytime of day for a soda and light snack. Was surprised that the charge for a glass of wine is $3-that's correct-which is unheard of in most hotel lounges. Great place to take a break during the day with the family and enjoy what has to be the best view of the bay in town.Avoid use of your own transportation. Construction nearby severely limits even the shortest of parking options.",21-Apr-16,5
We stayed here recently on a weekend getaway and were not disappointed with our 2 night stay. The hotel is walking distance to most attractions except Fisherman's Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge. The rooms were spacious enough for us and kept clean by housekeeping. The only thing is that valet is expensive and it was way cheaper to park directly across the street in the structure facing the Starbucks on the corner of Stockton and Sutter.,21-Apr-16,4
"Located in the centre of the city right next to Union Square, buses, street cars and shops, this hotel is perfectly located. The hotel itself looks very modern and clean, with polite and helpful staff. From our room on a mid-level floor, we looked out towards the city with water visible between other buildings with a lovely view (especially at night). The room was comfortable with all the usual comforts you would expect in a hotel of this quality. I was personally particularily impressed with the bathroom, which was very modern and vibrant, unlike most hotels where bathrooms seem like an after-thought. The food in the hotel bar/restaurant area as well as room service were a little pricey, but there are plenty of close diners, cafes and restaurants within a block or two, as well as a Starbucks literally across the road from the front doors of the hotel, as well as a McDonalds around the corner.During our stay there was a lot of construction work going on next door and on nearby streets (I believe from the building of a new rail line), so it was a little noisy from time to time depending on what work was happening, but nothing that kept us awake. The footpath outside the hotel was blocked off which meant a little extra walk around, but that is hardly the hotel's fault.The hotel fitness centre was pretty well equipped too with an impressive view, being on the second highest floor.A great, comfortable stay and a hotel I would highly recommend to anyone staying in downtown San Francisco.",20-Apr-16,5
Very nice place to be!!! Many shops and restaurants on the surroundings. Good food. Spacious and clean accommodations. The view is just astounding from the higher floor rooms. Would surely book it again!!,20-Apr-16,5
Grand location! Grand view! Grand service! An all around grand experience from check in to check out. The beds were super comfy.Housekeeping was quick and efficient and the front desk was snapping with a few special requests. We were four women so we had a suite and adjoining double. Perfect!!!You can't go wrong,20-Apr-16,5
Used points to upgrade to club floor and called like 5 times to make sure we would get a bay view. It's was totally worth it. This was a business trip for both my wife and myself AND we brought the baby so I was a little nervous and wanted things to be perfect. It worked out great. Hyatt staff provided a Pack'n'Play crib and Fisher Price tub (the whale) plus all kinds of baby products including a Mr Brown bottle brush. It doesn't get more thoughtful than that! They had emailed me prior to arrival to get the details on the child's age (8 months). The Grand Club on the 32nd floor was very welcoming and accommodating to our needs and unusual requests. We came up every morning for breakfast and the hors d'oeuvres in the evening mostly replaced a real dinner. Did I mention the views already? :)) Love the casualness of club lounges. They have an honor bar. You pour your own drinks and get to keep track of your own tab. How cool is that? We are coming back in the summer and I am looking forward to staying at the Grand Hyatt again.,20-Apr-16,5
"As others have mentioned the location of the Grand Hyatt is great. You are basically across the street from Union Square. But do know that this area is currently under construction and is one of the busiest intersections in the area. A lot of tourists, tour buses, tunnels being built. The hotel is nice. Your sort of standard 30+ floor Hyatt that is well maintained and comfortable. The service was alright. Not bad but not great either, but thats to be expected of a hotel that size.",19-Apr-16,3
"While a good location, the furnishings in the room are cheap and uncomfortable with exception of the bed, it is very comfortable. They charge 67 dalliers a day for valet parking which is about double what most SF hotels charge. Overall there are many better choices in their same price range, I'll stay elsewhere next time.",19-Apr-16,2
"This hotel located at the center of San Francisco, next to the Union Square. It takes only 5 mins. walk to the Westfield San Francisco Centre where you can find supermarket and food court (shopping mall closed on Sundays). It's also very convenience to take the cable car at Powell Street, or subway at the Powell BRAT station.We spent two nights at the one-bedroom suite with very beautiful city view. The choices of food and drinks provided by the Premium Lounge were not much, but the food was delicious. The Lounge is small but the city view there is even better than at our room. Since it is small, you may need to wait for a table during peak hours.The staff were very nice and friendly. Will definitely stay at this hotel again when we visit San Francisco next time.",17-Apr-16,5
"Travel date: April 2016Length of stay: 3 nights Number of guests: 5 adults Room type: 1 suite and 2 double bedrooms Purpose: business & pleasure Summary: great location, bad service, dated hotel. Overall rating is 3 out of 10. Will not stay at this hotel again. Not recommended. The Good:1. Received upgrade to a large suite 2. Express check-in 3. We got the rooms we requested (one connecting to the suite and one adjacent)4. Great location 5. Fast Internet 6. Received access the club lounge The Bad:1. Hotel parking is $67.5 per day2. No one answers the guest services telephone line. You have to call multiple time to get attention!3. Breakfast area is too small and very crowded. Food choices are limited and horrible (omelet is not included in the Buffett). We had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table!!!!!4. Gym is extremely small and very crowded. Long wait on all machines!!!5. There is nothing grand about this hotels ""don't know why it is called the Grand Hyatt"". Lobby is small with limited seating. 6. Rooms are dated and in need of serious renovations. 7. No special check-in area for IHG members 8. AC was not working in one of the rooms and we made multiple calls for repairs and the problem continues! 9. I was on the 34th floor and getting an elevator is a challange10. The noise level was unbearable due to poor insulation and cheap Windows. We were on the 34th floor and still could hear the street noise all day and throughout the night. Recommendations:1. Consider complementary hotel transportation to SFO2. Consider offering IPads in all gust rooms 3. Consider free hotel parking for IHG Spire members",17-Apr-16,1
We stayed in the Hyatt for a couple of days. The rooms were clean and spacious. I had a booked a city view room. We stayed in the 27th floor and the view was really good. The hotel is located very close to Union Square and is very close to restaurants and malls. The hotel staff were very friendly. The breakfast was good but repetitive. The spread is not too big.There is construction going on near the hotel and i was worried if that would affect my sleep but it didn't. Overall a very good stay,17-Apr-16,4
"This hotel is outstanding in all respects: responsiveness to concerns; speed of resolution; great food; excellent manners of all employees. Good location, close to shopping and Chinatown. Outstanding restaurant across the street..",17-Apr-16,5
The Grand Hyatt is in a good location close to restaurants and shopping. It's across the road from Union Square although there was some street construction going on while we are there which meant going the long way around to get there (obviously not the hotels fault). The guy who checked us in seemed to be quite confused and was a bit rude. The doormen and bar staff were helpful and friendly. The gym was bigger than expected and has great views. I would stay here again. ,15-Apr-16,4
"I typically like to stay at Hyatt, but this hotel disappointed me. Found a dirty bath towel hanging above shower curtain when I took a shower. GROSS! Also scared the hell out of me because it's totally unexpected. Will try to stay away next time.",15-Apr-16,2
"I really enjoy staying at the Hyatt when I work in San Francisco. It's a great location, the rooms are comfortable and have great views and I can have meetings in the restaurants with clients. The service is excellent and the food is delicious.",14-Apr-16,5
"Nice hotel centrally located to all major San Francisco attractions. Very professional check-in and valet staff. Not once did our family have to open the hotel lobby door. Staff was very attentive. Great location to be able to walk to just about any city attraction, including Chinatown, Little Italy, Fisherman's Wharf and the Westfield Shopping Mall. Would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to San Francisco on business or pleasure.",14-Apr-16,4
"This hotel is in a great position for shopping, sightseeing and plenty of good restaurants. We had a really lovely four night stay here. We did find the bedroom needed a little updating especially the bathroom but having said that you couldn't really complain about anything.The staff here are wonderful, very friendly and nothing us too much trouble. Breakfast was very good and so was the food in the bar that we sampled on the night of our arrival.Would definitely stay here again. ",13-Apr-16,4
"The room was good. For the price, I found it to be pretty basic but it's all about the location for this hotel. A block away from Union Square and Chinatown and just a few minutes walk from Financial district. Close to BART stations and really good restaurants and retail stores. I was put up on the 15th floor - no view from there. The staff is friendly and helpful. Free WiFi, coffee/tea. Overall, had a great stay.",13-Apr-16,4
"You can't have it all. This hotel is right next to Union Square, easy to get to from the airport by train, and is a nice stylish hotel with generous rooms. What you expect from a grand Hyatt. But like all of San Francisco, the rooms are not cheap. So it's hard to rate down for cost when most alternative 4+ star hotels are just as pricey. Would go back for the location and because of the reliability. But would look online for a good rate first. ",13-Apr-16,4
"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt but once outside the doors we were appalled by the dirt on the streets and sidewalks around the hotel. SF may be the city of song and legend but overall it is a rather dirty city with few or no green trees or plants visible outside of Golden Gate park. Also, the homeless were everywhere for which I don't fault them in any way but it is sad that such a wealthy city with such high earners can't do a better job helping those less fortunate.",13-Apr-16,5
"Only had a couple of nights in transit on the way east so needed a place central to the city highlights. Close to Union Square, major retail, Chinatown, North Beach and my favourite stores.A good tasteful spacious room and enjoyed the club facilities.Great views of the Bay and city from the Club lounge and Bay Room",11-Apr-16,4
"There are many hotels in this area, but the Hyatt is the best. It is modern and has very spacious rooms (not something easy to find in downtown SF) and if you go high enough - it has great views of the entire bay. Food is delicious, check-in process is amazingly fast. the concierge is very helpful and the location cannot be unbeaten. Note there are 3 Hyatt hotels in SF, this is the one next to Union Square called the ""Grant Hyatt"" not to be confused (as I did in the past) with others.",11-Apr-16,5
"Great location with excellent service. Room a bit small, but quiet and comfortable. Be aware of construction in the area. Valet area very congested, but staff does a great job of getting clients in/out of their vehicles.",11-Apr-16,5
"Staff are friendly (except the elderly gentleman at the concierge desk), room is clean, great location - walking distance to shops, restaurants and the citybus tour. My husband and i opted for a trip to SF this time to celebrate our 27th wedding anniversary -- and we had a great time! Only thing is, we tried to check in earlier, the receptionist was nice enough to accommodate us, but is going yo give us the 17th floor. I informed her that we paid extra to have the city view on floor 20 and up. She said nothing is available and will call us when one will be available. We went to grab lunch nearby and we were called within an hour. So it's not bad. But don't they check your reservation before giving you a room which costs less? We wanted to go back and stay at Grand Hyatt again. This time, I would like to try the lunch pairings at One Up restaurant, which we did not have time for this time. Maybe next time.",10-Apr-16,4
"The streets around the hotel are currently under construction, so there is some noise from the workers, but it is fairly muted at the higher floor levels.The location is great and you can get around well by walking on taking the street cars. If you forgot something, shopping is very close by.The room is a good size and the shower/bath tub combo is nice. The bed was comfortable and lots of pillows to choose from. I would stay here again.",10-Apr-16,4
Stayed at the hotel during DocuSign's Momentum 2016 conference. The quality of service was top-notch and the hotel and room was very clean and well maintained. Staff assisted with some urgent dry-cleaning requirements which was very helpful given that I needed to be in the conference rather than running around trying to locate a dry cleaner.,10-Apr-16,5
I spent 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt on a pleasure/business trip. The hotel staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. My flight from Philadelphia was 4 1/2 hours delayed causing me to arrive at the hotel at 1:30am PDT. My husband called ahead to ensure I would get my room preference and he ordered a bottle of wine with a small cheese plate to be waiting for me. He told me the person on the phone went out of his way to make it happen. The rooms are clean and well appointed with great beds for a restful sleep. I would definitely stay again. ,6-Apr-16,4
"Due to a conference, I did book the Grand Hyatt and I was happy about the choice. Got all I needed at the hotel with fast check-in and check-out. Restaurant could have a better menu but that's all about personal taste.",6-Apr-16,5
Contemporary hotel with fabulous rooms; outstanding artwork in the lobby/rooms; Starbucks served in hotel; wonderful fitness center; great top floor viewing room; comfortable beds with extra pillows; superb/helpful staff; great restaurant and breakfast bar; centrally located in heart of shopping/dining/gallery district,6-Apr-16,5
The Grand Hyatt on Stockton is in a great spot in Union sq...easy to get everywhere. Gym and Club have spectacular view of bay/ coit tower! Highly suggest staying here. The staff are well trained and the rooms are well equipped. Love having a gym open 24 hrs a day when I come form Europe.,6-Apr-16,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for one night when in San Francisco. The guest check in person was very polite. Thought the rooms were wonderful. Didn't like that they had no pop-machine in the whole hotel.Rooms were pricey but it is San Francisco.We would stay there again, no problem.Bed and pillows were comfortable.Our cruise got in at 10am and they were kind enough to give us a room right away. WOW!!!!",4-Apr-16,4
"The event team, lead by Meghan Nicholson are wonderful to work with. They are accommodating, friendly, responsive and quick to take action. If you select the Grand Hyatt as your next event location you will not be disappointed with the view of the city, ambiance of the hotel or professionalism of the staff.",4-Apr-16,5
"The rooms are wonderful - comfortable and pleasant modern design. Loved the oversized - long - bathroom sink. Central to nearly everything (I love to walk). I recommend the Grand Hyatt to anyone wishing a hassle-free, pleasant experience in the center of San Francisco",4-Apr-16,5
"This is my 3rd stay in this hotel mainly because of the location - in the heart of Union Square.The rooms are fine but not really can match the label of 'Grand Hyatt'. To my experience, the worst thing is 'staff'. You can hardly see any staff in the lobby who takes the initiative to greet you or even to give you a smile. I once called the housekeeping asking for amenities and the lady answered my call was very rude too!",4-Apr-16,3
"NEGATIVES1. Lots of construction noise that seemed to last late in the night and restart early in the morning-- sound proofing windows necessary (I was on the 10th floor, 1017). Construction dbl shifts starting at 6:30am and quieting down at 10pm. I should be warned of construction noise when booking-checking in-- see photo2. Lots of street noise--sound proofing windows necessary (10th floor room, 1017) Bed was way lumpy on the left side-- (it's good to flip a mattress)3. 2 plus inches of space between the floor and the door---Annoying with the bright hallway light streaming thru at night along with the standard hallway noise of people and doors--see photo4. Really ugly wall with fixtures-- see photo5. Scratched and beat door to my room--see photo6. Wouldn't offer a late check-out (3:00pm) without a half-day charge. I checked online-- plenty of rooms available at half the rate I paid--they weren't sold outMy daughter stayed on 22nd floor (2217) and had the exact same negatives I note aboveThis is a way below-average hyatt property and experience. Hyatt GM only seems to respond primarily to positive notes on TA. Hoping they stay consistent and don't reply to this negative review.Nah, I won't stay here again. There are too many other choices in Union Square area.",2-Apr-16,2
"I have stayed many times at the Grand Hyatt SF and I'll continue to come back. If you need to be in that part of the city for a conference, then stay there because it feels cleaner and safer than the area adjacent to the convention center. The hotel has been tastefully updated and is clean and comfortable. I think that it could use a few more elevators and more manpower at the check-in reception kiosks. When the weather is bad, the hotel creaks in the wind but that's not uncommon for high rises in the Bay Area. Overall I think that the Grand Hyatt is an excellent value for that part of the city.",2-Apr-16,4
"Snow in Denver delayed my arrival from late evening Wednesday to Thursday early morning, reducing my stay from 3 nights to 2, yet I was able to get in to my room right away at 9 am upon arrival - definitely much appreciated. I requested a room with a King bed, and was very happy with the room I received. Plenty of space, large and convenient desk/work area, comfortable chair near the floor to ceiling windows to enjoy the view of the neighborhood, and a delightful vanity/dressing area between the bedroom and bath. Others who traveled with our group shared a double room, and the king room was definitely more spacious.One evening, a friend and I had dinner at the OneUp restaurant. The waitstaff was attentive and pleasant, and the food was amazing. After a long day of meetings and walking, the chicken pot pie was perfect! Plenty of shopping within walking distance, and convenient to the city bus for further exploring. Wifi was not reliable, but I had a good cell signal, so no worries.Would definitely stay again for business or with family.",2-Apr-16,5
"There is a massive amount of work being undertaken directly outside this hotel - covering more than a block (something related to the subway, I believe). Work kicks-off at 7am on the dot - and is VERY noisy. The hotel did not pre-warn us of this - despite booking 5 months in advance. We had requested a ""quiet room, high floor"" - this was definitely not a quiet room (floor 25).The room itself is comfortable - altho' the internet is hit and miss.Regardless, at the end of the day, a hotel is for a good nights sleep and it was not possible to do so here.Avoid while the work is taking place.",1-Apr-16,2
"We loved being close to Chinatown and Union Square. We were able to do most of the things we wanted to do, find great places to eat. We added the Grand Club level to our stay which made it less stressful and was convenient for us",1-Apr-16,4
"Great location. Windows are massive so light is great in the room as well. Plenty of elevators, so didn't have to wait long even when there were lots of people there for a conference. Housekeeping staff was wonderful -- friendly and kind!",31-Mar-16,5
"Nice hotel, great people. However I was not lucky and found stubborn smell in the bathroom. Staff did not offer to change to another room, even though I suggest it. May be the hotel was full. The TV is useless, considering I watch only PBS, NBC, CBS. It has a computer keyboard, who knows for what. Ah! I almost forgot, I had to pay (not much) for WiFi upgrade to continue working in the evenings. The standard WiFi does not even connect. The IT staff was very helpful in this field.",30-Mar-16,3
"This is a beautiful hotel centrally located with amazing staff. As a professor, I travel all the time for work. This was hands down one of the nicest and most convenient ""work"" hotels I have stayed in. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt Union Station",29-Mar-16,5
"The view from our room on the 27th floor was great of the city. If you are sharing a room, like I was, don't expect a big room. I had a colleague with their own room with a king bed and it was much more spacious than my room with two queen beds.",29-Mar-16,4
"A perfect hotel for a Easter weekend getaway. Prior San Francisco stays included the Wharf area as well as Nob Hill; the Grand Hyatt just off of Union Square is a more desirable location, due to its close proximity to many fine restaurants of all levels, as well as shopping and cultural venues. The Hyatt has been one of my hotels of choice in many cities, and the Grand Hyatt confirmed that again. Comfortable, upscale accommodations; will stay here again.",29-Mar-16,5
"We stayed at this hotel for five nights with my family while we toured San Francisco and shopped around Union Square. This hotel is located one block away from Union Square and the location is great. The hotel is a high rise and has spectacular views of the bay area, specially at the penthouse. The bar is very nice and there is a convenient Starbucks kiosk in the lobby. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was hesitant to stay in such a large hotel, but we had a great stay and I would definitely return.",28-Mar-16,5
"This is a GRAND Hyatt. However, there is much that is not grand at all. For example, the lounge chair in the room had Fritos between the side of the chair and the seat cushion. Easy to see; easy to smell. But not ""GRAND."" Another example . . . it is incredibly easy to hear the noises from the neighboring units. One person in the room next to ours was not feeling well. We knew this because we could hear the person cough, sniff, clear their throat, etc., etc.. Maybe I'm wrong, but it just seems to me that if I'm staying at a GRAND Hyatt, the noise I hear from neighboring rooms should be minimal to none. In fact, I recently stayed at a Hyatt Place and the noise from neighboring units was far less problematic. As others have noted, the hotel does have a great location. And the personnel in the Grand Club lounge (Anh, Jaydee, Ben, Billy, Judy) are fabulous. But if you're looking for a CLEAN and QUIET room, be advised that you might be out of luck at this property.",28-Mar-16,2
"Definitely much better than the airport Hyatt (that's currently under renovation; reviewed previously), this hotel is located strategically right in the heart of San Francisco, nearby iconic places like the Union Square, Chinatown, and the highly connected Powell Street Station (BART, Cable Car, trams and major bus lines incl. tour buses). Very happening and lively place. Shopping, food, nightlife entertainment, everything within walking distance. (Not to be confused with the other SF Hyatt i.e. Hyatt Regency by the Bay in the slightly less entertaining financial district.)The interior design of the rooms and public areas had a very contemporary 21st century theme that I absolutely love (none of that gaudy tacky flowery chandeliery nonsense you see in other hotels where they can't decide which continent, era or century they're trying to emulate). The personalized welcome message on the TV screen and the interactive consoles were a nice touch. Want to order food? Just scan the QR code given in the interactive channel anytime.Lobby and restaurant make you feel like you're in Mass Effect or Deus Ex. Silicon Valley scifi technopia feel resonating. Yes, I'm totally geeking out here.You can request rooms higher up for the best views, but you'll need to book way ahead for those. The hotel is pretty full all the time.Enjoyed the stay very much. Giving it 5* rating hands down. Highly recommended for techies.",28-Mar-16,5
"I have completed the Hyatt Trifecta in San Francisco. On prior visits, I have stayed at the Hyatt Regency and Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf, but on this visit, stayed at the Grand Hyatt. Upon arrival, it was a little crazy dealing with parking; there's very little space and construction near front entrance. Despite the High Price of Valet Parking ($67/night), we valeted with all the street chaos. (There's another lot nearby, but its still $45/night.)The lobby is not as grand as the Hyatt Regency in town. They have little kiosks to check-in. We waited less than a minute. Lobby was busier than expected, but we realized some schools are on Spring Break, already.We were automatically upgraded to a Grand Hyatt Club Room. Cool. When we reached our room, we had gorgeous views. Plus, we had access to Club Room w/breakfast, snacks & wine. Free Wi-Fi and a refrigerator in the room (but no mini bar or water).Comfortable bed, Huge shower and separate vanity area (nice!). Grand Hyatt Club Room has gorgeous views, as well. Plus, good selection of breakfast items. (smoked salmon & bagels, cereals, pastries, coffee, lattes, etc.) Selection of wines & liquor that run on the honor system (you tell them how many you had). Overall, good service. Front Desk Clerk, Doormen, & Club Servers were all very friendly. A pleasant stay and I would return.",28-Mar-16,4
we stayed here for 3 nights as first stop of California road trip to celebrate my 50th birthday. From the outset the service was excellent. We were given a club room with an amazing view of the city from the 33rd floor. A gift was in room on arrival. We used the club room for breakfast and drinks later in the day which was very nice. Rooms spacious and modern furnishings. Hotel very close to Union Square so a bit of noise during night but nothing too bad. Recommended as a good standard of hotel in central location.,28-Mar-16,4
"Great hotel. Very clean and the service was outstanding. The Grand Club Lounge is excellent and I loved the honor bar in evenings. $3 beers/wines and $4 cocktails that you pour yourself! If you are looking for an upscale property in a centrally located San Francisco location, this is the place. I",28-Mar-16,5
"Ok, so if you are looking to do a little shopping while in San Francisco, you only have to walk out the door of this hotel. Overall the hotel is fairly well appointed for the price point in the heart of San Francisco. Short walks to almost everything. The Club Room is convenient but to small for the needs that this busy hotel has. The gym is adequate to get moving before heading out - nothing fancy. The bed is very comfortable and the room is ready for all the high tech conveniences. Only issue is very limited draw space if you like to un pack. Absolutely would stay here again on next visit to get my San Francisco fix.",27-Mar-16,4
"The hotel is tired and is need of a serious renovation and redecoration. The rooms are drab and depressing, as are the common areas, especially the elevators and the hallways leading to the rooms. Everything about the place is old, nothing is forward thinking or welcoming. We won't be back unless and until this property is comprehensively upgraded.",27-Mar-16,2
"The hotel is nice newly renovated hotel and the entire staff is extremely nice and helpful. I was fortunate enough to stay in one of the suites with an attached room and was very impressed with the size of the suite (3214). There was a Beautiful kitchen with a large wine fridge, coffee machine, there were 2 very large sofas and a dining room table that could fit 8 perfectly surrounded by floor to ceiling sliding Windows with dramatic views of the city. The rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bedroom was tiny but overall a great value.If you have access to the lounge it's not a bad place to stop for breakfast, snacks or the panoramic views.The restaurants were very good incase you just want to stay in and enjoy a meal.They have a nice gym located on the 35th floor and they are pet friendly incase you want to bring your four-legged friend with you ;)",26-Mar-16,4
"Despite a modern renovation and clean guest rooms, only the basics are provided. Prices seem to reflect design and newness of common areas, where, if you're traveling for business, you spend little time. Rooms are well-designed but amenities are sparse. No mini-bar, no safe, water coolers in the hallway by the ice-machines.",26-Mar-16,3
"We attended a Saturday night dinner at a downtown restaurant and booked the Grand Hyatt as it was two blocks away. Everything in downtown SF is blocks away from this hotel - the location is ideal. There was a long line at the desk on arrival, but four very pleasant clerks moved it quickly. We had booked a club room, which had a fantastic view. The room was a bit on the small side, but was clean, with a comfortable bed. The club rooms include access to a hospitality room with a comp breakfast and evening hospitality. It was a nice room with decent fare, but the room fills quickly (no one was asking for proof that anyone was entitled to be there, which was odd.) All in all, this hotel is perfect if you're visiting downtown SF",25-Mar-16,4
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt twice during our visit to San Francisco, both times for 2 nights. Check in was easy, very friendly and professional staff who easily dealt with a situation on our first check in (Expedia had stuffed up the booking details - not Grand Hyatt's fault). The quality of the hotel is superb, very comfortable king sized bed, great shower etc etc, good gym (no pool) and the view from our room was spectacular. The location is fantastic, close to shopping, restaurants, cable cars, the financial district (great coffee and lunch options) etc. Super easy to get to from SFO. Complimentary wifi also a big plus! However, all this comes at a price - and for the price per night, we found a couple of things lacking. Firstly, the hotel operates a system where very few ""extras"" are provided initially in the room, and you have to request these be sent up (e.g. A bathrobe). The list of things to request is extensive..., but I asked for three separate items and not once were these actually delivered without us having to contact the desk a second time (and I had waited more than 4 hours on both occasions, not unreasonable I would have thought.)Also, service in the OneUp bar is pretty surly, especially when it's busy. Great drinks selection and yummy food, but given the exceptional service we experienced elsewhere in SF, this could be done better.",25-Mar-16,4
"My husband and I travelled to San Francisco for our 1 year anniversary. We got a room on the Grand Club Level thinking it would be better than a regular room. The room was extremely small, with inadequate seating and the club breakfast needed some additional items. We were disappointed in these two things, but aside from that, we really enjoyed our stay. We loved the hotel, the location, the view, and several of the staff members. Liz in concierge was extremely helpful, and even called one of the tour company's to book our tour for us. The doormen were friendly and helpful, even after helping us for four days straight. The view from our room was great!! We had a view of downtown and the bay, unfortunately we couldn't sit there and admire it :) Overall, it was a great stay. The hotel is right in the middle of union square, the staff is attentive, and the views are amazing. I would definitely recommend staying here, but probably in a regular room.",25-Mar-16,4
"We just booked the hotel for a one night stay while we toured San Francisco. Comfortable beds, great city view at night. Beautiful TV, however only with very basic channels. Other channels were extra. Comfortable large beds. We got a City View Double. We didn't get a chance to experience everything we could from the hotel, but the staff was great. They even went out of their way to provide us with a drink that the vending machine took, due to it being out of stock. This hotel is very luxurious and highly recommend to those who can put in the extra $$$ to stay at a great place.",24-Mar-16,5
"The hotel is centrally located & we had a great view. Quiet, clean, good staff, everything was great! The room was very modern/oriental in feel & comfortable. I didn't try the restaurant so I can't comment on that.",24-Mar-16,5
"We came here for only one night after a long flight and it was like finding a lovely Oasis in the desert. The service was excellent, the hotel itself is beautiful and modern, the facilities are top notch - and the view from the fitness center is stunning. Great place to stay and centrally located. I would highly recommend this hotel for travel for both personal and business.",23-Mar-16,5
"was in this hotel for 6 nights and just loved it. location was beautiful and close to very good shopping areas and excellent restaurants. the view from our room was phenomenal. the travel assistants were very nice and gave us excellent advise and service for our daily trips. Our room (2 queen size beds) was a bit small, but very clean. would definitely come back!",23-Mar-16,5
I booked a room at this hotel about a month ago as I will be planning A trip from Los Angeles for me and my wife's anniversary. I have been going back-and-forth about upgrading our room for room with a view as I know it would be important to my wife. Called couple times and spoke with reservations and explained that I was on a budget to see what the best arrangement would be. And if I should wait till checking in to see if there was any last minute offers or a complementary upgrade for our anniversary. I was assured that rooms may book up quickly and to spring for the upgrade. $400 later Today I'm receiving an email for a last-minute upgrade at less than half the price. I feel cheated and maybe I just should've waited.,22-Mar-16,1
"Check in was not pleasant, I was not welcome the host stand person did not go over the amenities. I got bitten in the room I stayed reported it to the manager he was careless he transferred me to file the complaint with the housekeeper supervisor. I left a message and the housekeeper never return my call.",22-Mar-16,1
"This hotel provided me the weekend get-away I was so in need of. Staff was extremely professional and courteous. The entire facility were first class, with an incredible view of the San Francisco skyline.",22-Mar-16,5
"When I checked in, I was given a room that was in the middle of being cleaned. Not a good start but Maria, on the Check In desk quickly sorted me an alternative room. The location of the hotel was very conveinient.",22-Mar-16,4
"Staying at the Grand Hyatt was a great experience. The rooms are on the small side, but definitely enough room for two. The service was perfect--not one complaint, the rooms were clean and nicely decorated, and the location was great. It was the perfect home base for exploring the city.",21-Mar-16,5
Great service. I was not feeling well and the hotel did everything to accomodate my needs. The staff was really friendly and responsive. Next time I go to San Francisco I will stay there for sure! 100% recommended!,21-Mar-16,5
"My partner and I stayed for two nights. The staff at reception were extremely professional and attentive. They allowed us to check-in early and gave us a very nice corner room with a King size bed.The room was a good size with everything that you would need to make an enjoyable stay - comfy bed with premium bedding, desk, sitting area, quiet A/C, plenty of reading lights, HDTV, fresh coffee machine and free Wi-Fi. N.B. Our room was not affected (thankfully) by noise with the ongoing building work with the new Apple Store currently being constructed next door to the Grand Hyatt. Completion date it would appear, is not too far away so I don't think it will be a problem in a months time or so.For a hotel of this size we were surprised that the bar and restaurant areas were quite small. In fact, the only real criticism we had on our stay here was the limited offerings for breakfast when it came to the buffet. In comparison to other similar rated hotels in the area, we were very disappointed with the choice on offer and the quality of food here. Staying many times in Union Square, we've come to expect better value for money.Seeing as there is an abundance of restaurants and food outlets in the area, we will opt to eat out next time we stay.Overall, a very pleasant stay at the Grand Hyatt made even better by the very kind gesture offered by Maria T. at the front desk to help celebrate my partner's birthday.- Thank you again Maria!Much appreciated.",21-Mar-16,3
"Beautiful modern rooms. Bathroom is stunning with wood trim and raised sink. Lots of closet space and drawers. In room safe and frig. Well furnished and well lit. Beds are super comfy. The hotel has a gym, business center, restaurant and room service. Also sits across the street from giant Starbucks. Lobby is gorgeous and welcoming!",20-Mar-16,5
"The hotel was nice. This is my second time staying. The room was small for 4 people but we made it work. The bathroom has a sliding door with no lock and a big gap so forget privacy when going to the bathroom. If you are bringing your kids like we did plan on one sleeping on the floor, the 2 beds are double NOT queen. The rooms are too small for queens. at over 400 a night getting 2 rooms was not an option. The food is okay at the one restaurant. It very expensive.(but so are all the places to eat) San Fran is a fun city but not Cheap!! We had a great time shopping, The Grand Hyatt is in the perfect location to the shopping, food. . We walked to the mall. There is a movie theatre at the mall for rainy days. The Imax is a taxi ride away so is Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 to catch the boat to Alcatraz. The concierge service is AMAZING!! ask for John or Elaine!. They are building the big daddy of big daddy Apple store right beside the hotel. the one further down is moving to this location. There is construction right in front of the hotel. They are extending the subway line right in front of the hotel so there is a noise issue in the morning. I would stay again.",20-Mar-16,4
"Stayed here for GDC with a friend. The Hotel is on Union Square, half a mile from the Moscone Center, which is a straight shot and a painless walk. It's in a very safe and comfortable area of San Francisco. My room had a beautiful view of the city. Every staff member I spoke to was very friendly and anticipated my needs. Highly recommend upgrading to a club room if possible; the Grand Club is excellent. A bit expensive, but you're paying for quality. Would stay here again!",20-Mar-16,4
"There is no way this hotel should be categorized as a Grand Hyatt. It has all the charm of a plastic, disposable razor. Let's start with the he outrageous noise from the 24 hour construction going on in Union Square. Now, you pay a premium for that room ($499 per night!) precisely because it faces Union Square; yet forget about getting a good night's sleep. I ended up feeling ripped off. The room and bathroom are decent sizes but hardly the comfort level you expect at a Grand Hyatt. The mini bar is not stocked and the room have virtually no amenities. You have to fill in a form or call guest services to request things like toothbrush, slippers, robe. No bottled water provided either. Ugh...why bother? While the location is good, you are paying a series premium for a very sub par experience. Look elsewhere.",19-Mar-16,2
Amenities left a lot to be desired. Liked it more when bar was on top floor. Food was okay but overpriced. Room and bathroom very small. Close to shopping and dining.There is no gift shop and no in room paper delivery. Cost of parking was outrageous.,19-Mar-16,3
"Very clean with super friendly staff. I felt right at home and I got an amazing (although short) night of rest. I will stay here again! I got in late and even tough it was late, everyone was friendly and helpful. I was very grateful.",17-Mar-16,5
"Very standard hotel but Starbucks is across the street and you can walk to the business/financial district, to Union Square and to Chinatown. It's a 3-4 star hotel, busy, functional although with no particular charm",15-Mar-16,3
"Extended a business trip with a weekend stay and could not have been happier with location, service, room, and view. Construction and a St. Patrick's Day parade complicated already intense traffic so take advantage of easy Muni access and do not bring a car if you can avoid it.",15-Mar-16,5
"The room is clean and nice, with good view of the SF city. Chinatown is within 5 min walk up north, with the downtown right south. The buffet breakfast is good but sometime it may get crowded. For some reason, the air-conditioning is making some noise if the temperature was set other than 22 degree ...",14-Mar-16,4
"The standard room was clean and functional, but rather on the small side. Although the hotel appears quite new, my room showed some wear and tear, like a cracked sink in the bathroom or some veneer coming off. Didn't bother me much, though. Staff was friendly and efficient. There is a nice bar in the hotel; I was just a bit irritated the bartender needed to look up a standard drink's recipe...While my stay was totally OK and I wouldn't mind to return for business, I probably will check out one of the many other hotels close by a next time.",14-Mar-16,3
"the hotel is very well located (union square)very nice inside and great decorationthe view at 36th floor is amazing, food is averagelobby a little bit windy and miss some area to chat if still street work ask for high floorpier is at 2 km, lombart street at 3 km",13-Mar-16,4
"I stay at this Grand Hyatt whenever I have business or pleasure downtown San Francisco, CA. As a Hyatt Diamond member I stay at Hyatt's all over the State of California and the other parts of the world whenever I can this hotel is as good as any of them. I love good service & great restaurant & bar and this has it all.",13-Mar-16,5
"Not sure how long the construction will be taking place right next to the hotel but I absolutely did not sleep. When I complained, they did move me to a higher floor but absolutely didn't go above and beyond to make it easier on me. They weren't on top of their game. The rooms were very beautiful though and trendy looking hotel",12-Mar-16,3
"As suggested in the title, I was here for business in San Francisco. My review and high marks are predicated largely upon this fact and the relative affordability of the hotel versus other suitable options. Here's what I liked and thought they could improve upon:Pluses1) common areas are very impressive. Stylish and new. Nice wow factor.2) room was also new and spacious. Bed was comfortable - not plush like the ritz, but perfectly adequate. Views from upper floors (i was on the 25th) are very good. Like the knock out shade operated from bedside. I read that some of the rooms are tired and some renovated. I obviously got the later.3) staff were all very friendly, well trained and helpful. Particularly liked the bartender who knows how to pour.4 ) loaction is terrific for access to downtown financial district. If you're strictly a tourist, I'm guessing you may want to consider other options.Minuses - not a lot here, somewhat have to nitpick1) gym is too small for a hotel this size. It was tight in the morning.2) would have been nice to have a bottle of water available in the room3) strong light from the hallway slightly illuminated the room at nightThat's it. I was very pleased with the hotel and would return on future business trips.",12-Mar-16,5
"We were on the 32nd floor in a spacious, comfortable and clean room with a city view.There is a room on the 32nd floor that serves a very good breakfast, afternoon and evening eats. We had to purchase any alcoholic beverage but everything else was included, Reception provided great service and there is a very convenient garage across the street that will save you money if you have a car. We went for a one night birthday celebration and it was everything a first class hotel should be. It doesn't offer romantic dÃ©cor, but that isn't the intention.",11-Mar-16,4
"This is a wonderful property, and my first time stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. Have to admire the Grand Hyatts which I've visited since 1992 in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, Zurich and now here.The Hyatt guys are prepared to invest and re-invest to provide premium services and facilities. The standouts for this hotel are: - Central location in Union Square, the hotel hub in San Francisco - close to the department stores, boutiques, financial district and China Town. You are also sitting atop an underground network (Powell Station) which provides connectivity to the greater Bay Area.- Common Areas - there is a ""wow"" factor in the main lobby area decor. The Check-in area is comprised of 3 ""pods"" where you can speak with each front office officer confidentially, without another guest ogling behind you. This all provides for a very personal and private experience. - Well designed rooms with luxury touches including hardwood floors, mirror wall bathrooms and co-ordinated interiors- all very welcoming. I was upgraded to a Club Room Suite which was large and had separate lounge, bedroom, dressing and bathroom.- Club Room - it's worth considering a Club Room which offers a higher floor - 32nd to 35th floors and expansive, unobstructed views of San Francisco. The Club facilities include access to the Club which provides for a more than adequate breakfast and other food and drink options during the day and evening. All-in-all an enjoyable stay. I was considering to sample another hotel for a change (see other reviews for this city), but ultimately reverted to the Grand Hyatt.If you have no experience with the Grand Hyatt brand, or San Francisco's hotels then I would highly recommend. It has an excellent price point booking on sites via TripAdvisor. I am a business and leisure traveller who is out on the road 3 months of every year.",11-Mar-16,5
"This hotel cuts through the busy jumble of usual hotel chaos to the simple business of easy registration, nearby elevators, comfortable rooms and beds and wonderful views! The absolute most user friendly hotel I have ever stayed at. I loved my experience at the Grand Hyatt!",11-Mar-16,4
"Stayed here for 6 nights on a business trip. The location is great, right next to Union Square, Cable Car and the shopping area. There are also many restaurants and bars in the area. The service was great and the breakfast was very good as well. The rooms are a bit old, but I heard that there are some newly refurbished rooms available as well. All in all a pleasant stay.",9-Mar-16,4
"Great location just around the corner of Union Square. The hotel has everything you expect from a Grand Hyatt hotel. Rooms are clean but without inspiration, very much focused on the business traveller. Services are good - concierge is very efficient in arranging dining and transportation options and I was there during SB50 weekend. Only the breakfast lets this hotel down. Buffet has very poor options and a la carte is so so. Go elsewhere for breakfast.",7-Mar-16,4
"There's a construction next to the hotel, so if you're looking to sleep, I wouldn't recommend this place. The food/room service is overpriced, there are better restaurant with less price nearby, or pretty much everywhere.",7-Mar-16,3
Great hotel....Hyatt's typical are great and consistent. The location is perfect for both business and leisure travel. The rooms are spacious which can be hard to come by in the city and the customer service is fantastic! ,6-Mar-16,5
"Valet parking costs us $65 for 1 night. Bed is not comfortable. Ice machine is broke. Bed sheets feels like paper. They could use a more mirrors. Loud noise from upstairs- you can hear people walking. No military discount if you booked through hotels.com Overall, I didn't get the comfort for what I paid for...",6-Mar-16,3
From the front desk to housekeeping we felt recognized. Our room had an expansive view of the city. Location of the hotel within walking distance of the best shopping and eating in the city. Who could ask for more?,6-Mar-16,5
"Hotel is located adjacent to Union Square and offers convenient access to several local attractions. As reported by others, ongoing construction of Apple store adjacent to the hotel created constant traffic snafus that affected on and off boarding of guests and visitors. However, concierge and doormen worked hard to minimize the impact and efficiently moved patrons to nicely refurbished common areas and rooms. Check-in was equally efficient and welcoming; we were kindly offered a room on a high level that faced away from the construction. As such, we did not experience any noise issues related to the construction. Newly furbished room was provided with modern accents and elements of the Hyatt brand. The room was of standard size and had floor-to-ceiling windows that extended the width of the room - that made it very bright. Working desk had facile access to several power outlets; the free wifi provided robust and reliable signal. The bed was comfortable and the climate control, as were all the other fixtures (lighting, fridge, bathroom), were functional. Breakfast at the new and nicely decorated ""One Up"" restaurant offered a limited buffet selection that in my opinion was not commensurate with the rate charged. The restaurant was also small relative to the size of the hotel; consequently, the staff was evidently working hard to move their clients through their meals, which negatively affected the experience. Overall, this is a nice and well-managed establishment; I would consider revisiting.",5-Mar-16,4
Reservation desk service is terrible! They lied to me on that rooms are not available and I would need to pay to get a kind bed and city view room. Asked to speak with manager and I was told there manager is not there and transferred me to general reservation desk of Hyatt. That is where I found out that I was lied to and the hotel was not full or over booked!,4-Mar-16,2
The room was good but very expensive. No water or mini bar in the room. Bottled water available from room service a$29 for two large bottles. Club lounge very disappointing limited food and all drinks were charge to room. Very odd accounting system - made charges to my credit card twice a day. They charge as they think and give you balance at the end of the stay.,4-Mar-16,1
"The Grand Hyatt is a somewhat basic large, chain hotel. It has some elements which are great (modern rooms and gym with views from 35 floor), a central location in Union Square, and reasonably priced. First impression was also quite positive, the front desk staff was friendly and provided early check in; they also have an open concept front desk that is unique and welcoming.My biggest issue is the extremely thin walls and doors which don't prevent any noise from entering room. There was so much noise on both Saturday and Sunday morning due to construction, cleaning and unruly neighbors that impacted our sleep.Also, WiFi worked well in room.",3-Mar-16,4
"This is a typical big hotel and totally suitable for a business trip. Good beds, good gym and central to everywhere.Its a safe option for business people and families.Excellent breakfast and an excellent concierge.",3-Mar-16,4
"While we weren't staying at this Hyatt, we needed to activate our Hyatt points so decided on a lunch at this downtown venue off Union Square. We were really pleasantly surprised by the delicious selection of tapas style dishes for our lunch at their 2nd floor restaurant. Tasty and memorable with outstanding service. And not overly expensive in a quiet and tasteful city centre venue. Lunch for two for less than $25. ",1-Mar-16,5
The Grand Hyatt is located by Union Square. There are lots of great stores within walking distance for those who like to shop. It's within 4 blocks of the BART -- most convenient is Montgomery station rather than Powell. The rooms are clean and sleep was not a problem. The food for conference was tasty. Service was great. Nothing to complain about.,1-Mar-16,5
"I've been to SF three times now and every time, I strive to stay at the Hyatt. The location is fantastic. Right in Union square but still far enough to feel immersed in more residential neighbourhoods. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are always attentive, the concierge is always friendly. The rooms themselves are small - but this is standard for SF. The one complaint I would make is that, I wish the washroom doors were able to shut completely (sliding door, leaves a crack open) and that the washroom had an exhaust fan. WIFI was included when we were there and it is high speed. The gym is fantastic for a hotel gym. Many free weights and different machines to work out on. Overall, had a fantastic time and always felt good coming ""home"" to the Hyatt.",1-Mar-16,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in SanFrancisco to attend the ""2016 Epilepsy Pipeline Conference"" which brings together decision-makers with a stake in the field of epilepsy treatment, therapeutic innovation, and product development. This was my first stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I found the Hotel excellent in all areas, from: check-in to layout of the room - for a disabled individual like myself, to cleanliness, to service provided, to my rooms value for the dollar ($). In addition the Hotel and room lay-out for a disabled individual like myself was excellent. The conference I attended was in this Hotel and the over three (3) days the Hotel conference room added to the important subjects and classes and was important to the success of this conference. I definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt Hotel to everyone visiting San Francisco and on my next visit here I look forward to returning to this very special Hotel.",1-Mar-16,5
"The hotel was nice overall. The construction was a nuisance when trying to unwind, but the earplugs left in the room was a good alternative. The overall room was nice, just a bit dated in the furniture.",29-Feb-16,4
"I've stayed at the Marriott down the street from this place and I couldn't sleep one bit due to the noise coming through the windows at 3am with garbage pick-up and people walking around. However, here at the Grand Hyatt, I couldn't even hear the construction going on, right outside my window! I was on floor 21 and I could see the crane swiveling back and forth, but not a peep. I actually got some sleep this time!",29-Feb-16,5
"With a sincere attempt to combine business travel with an opportunity to celebrate a 22nd wedding anniversary, this hotel delivered in terms of location and accommodations, but failed on the attention to details.",29-Feb-16,4
"It is a 35 story Best Western. The bed was uncomfortable. Among other things, the mattress shifted around. The bath/shower had no hand bars. The window shade system is ridiculous -- either it was completely open or shut out light like a wall. The lights had no central control and each light was a game of trying to find the switch. Room service is very expensive. I can't speak to the quality because II didn't try it. The location is good -- except for the subway construction next door.",29-Feb-16,2
"First of all, the excellent downtown location cannot be beat if you are a tourist or on business..Even though the hotel was busy on the mid-February weekend we visited, we found the service staff to be very friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the bellboy, which is no easy task! The rooms are decent sized and tastefully decorated with a contemporary feel. The beds were also comfortable. We had a fantastic view from our room, overlooking Union Square and could also see Alcatraz in the distance.While I don't have many complaints, as others have mentioned, the walls are on the thin side. We could definitely hear guests in the next room at certain hours. Also, there was major construction going on in front of hotel, Every time we came back from somewhere, our taxi driver was harassed by the police that was directing traffic, so we had scurry out of the taxi in a hurry,If you are traveling with multiple family members, club level is a cost effective option in terms of breakfast and snacks. It's also a wonderful way to let teens have their own safe space away from parents, or parents to have a working space away from children.",28-Feb-16,5
"Despite the ongoing construction next to the hotel, my room on the 20th floor was an oasis of quiet with a view of the city and the Bay. Good lighting, comfortable chairs, plentiful hot water/towels, all contributed to an enjoyable 3 night stay at the Hyatt.",28-Feb-16,4
"I agree with the majority of the other reviews that this hotel is an excellent choice for a central downtown location. We have stayed here multiple times, and have found the Club level to be an excellent option with a great breakfast and nice choices for afternoon hors dâ€™oeuvres, with desserts in the evening.The rooms are a fair size, with a small desk area. The beds are comfortable. There are blackout shades for the floor to ceiling windows. There is wi-fi for a fee, but it is free on Club level. The rooms are quiet - although currently rooms facing Union Square and Stockton Street have some street noise from the subway construction. Bathroom showers are good size. One concern: the toilets use a pressurized flush, and can be loud.Staff is friendly and helpful. Workout facilities are adequate and do have a view.A great choice for downtown accommodations.",27-Feb-16,4
"In contrast to our stay at the Hyatt Regency, I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. I used a Diamond Suite Upgrade here and was incredibly impressed with the room which was very well appointed, generous in size and had two bathrooms which was a delight. Staff here were truly wonderful - with the exception of a female staffer manning the lounge who was very rude, but the rest of the staff more than made up for that. The views from this hotel are quite something - especially from the club lounge - just breathtaking! The location is awesome, a great place to base yourself for work or pleasure. There are some terrific dining options nearby and the shopping can't be beaten!",27-Feb-16,4
"Love the hotel. Great location. Rooms were so comfortable and inviting. I was on the street where construction was taking place and it did effect my stay in any way. All the staff I encountered was kind, high attention to details. Room Service was fast and the most incredible Quesada that I have ever had. Great location and the Apple store, developing adjance to the hotel, is going to be fantastic. Ambience of the lobby is very welcoming. I don't usually like standup check-ins but this was good because I was standing too. Definitely will return.",27-Feb-16,5
"the hotel was ok, but not excellent, too expensive, location was perfect, no breakfast included unfortunately, no additional things like water, cosmetics, newspapers, cafe, tea etc. it could be more clear",27-Feb-16,3
"I am here right now at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco on my last night of a 4-day business trip. I absolutely loved this hotel. The front desk staff is awesome. My room is amazing! I have a corner room on the 16th floor, the rooms are so spacious with a huge bathroom. I just came from a trip in DC, at a nice hotel, but the room was half the size of this one, so this was a very welcome surprise. There is a lot of construction on this street (Stockton), not sure what's going on but it's pretty extensive. Overall this is an outstanding hotel. Everything is very ""high tech"" here. You can control most things from your TV. I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat! ",26-Feb-16,5
Nice hotel however a Little bit of construction going on in union square. Not great views but rooms are very nice and staff is efficient and lovely to deal with. The hotel is central located only about 5 minute uber to fisherman's wharf. Rooms are spacious and have a sit down vanity as well. ,26-Feb-16,4
"I am a frequent traveler to SF, and they hyatt is one of my favorite places. Not because it is the most luxurious, it isnt, but for the price it is my top choice. The hotel has recently undergone a complete renovation, so everything is brand new. The hotel rooms are not large, but well designed with style. I especially like the modern bathrooms and finishes.The location by union square is a great. It is not a long walk from the Powell Street Bart stop so easy and cheap to get to from the airports.I think the grand hyatt is my first choice and a bargain for the price",26-Feb-16,5
"I loved my recent stay at the Grand Hyatt. All of the staff were friendly and ensured that the stay was of excellent quality. The room, bathroom and closet was the perfect size. The remote shade opener from the door and bed were nice to have when we wanted to open the shades from the door and close them while in bed or while changing. I will definitely be staying here again (I've already told friends that we're going to plan a trip).",24-Feb-16,5
"If you want to go shopping, which we did, the venue is outstanding. Within walking distance of all the major department stores. Food at the restaurant was exceptional and the service everywhere was superior.",24-Feb-16,5
"You want to be in the heart of the city then this hotel should be your choice. Five star standards in all respects, excellent rooms and well trained staff. Top quality meals in restaurants too. Union square has all the shops you would want.",23-Feb-16,5
Conveniently located close to Union Square this hotel was a perfect choice for a one night layover in San Francisco. Very modern rooms and great service make this hotel easy to get in and out. We had plenty of time to take in a cable car ride to Buena Vista cafe for our morning Irish Coffee and a leisurely walk back. ,22-Feb-16,5
"Stayed for the entire week (Feb 16 to Feb 20), and the service was great. Was able to secure a room a 645am on the Monday arrival, thanks to Steven at reception. I have stayed at the Hyatt on the last 3 of 4 trips that I have done to SF, and will stay again.",22-Feb-16,5
"We stayed on 25th floor with fantastic views overlooking Union Square and downtown San Francisco. The hotel is quietly efficient, quiet well appointed and spacious rooms. we had a twin double. Fabulous gym, coffee cart open from 0530 hrs (great for the international traveller) and in a fabulous location. The Union square area is smart, fashionable and have something for everyone. it is also quiet on an evening so great to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Wharf. It is located on Stockton and Sutter so 2 minutes walk from the Powell-Sutter cable car stop which takes you directly down to the Wharf. The concierge is fabulous and overall I cannot fault this hotel. Will stay again.",22-Feb-16,5
"Convenient when visiting the area for a convention. Just two of my events were held in the hotel, but it was set in a central location. Valet & front desk employees were attentive and very polite. The room itself was immaculate - well-appointed, comfortable beds, great TV, clean bathroom, quality toiletries, beautiful view. The only downside I found was the $10 per night Wi-Fi charge. A little excessive for such a huge hotel, in my opinion. Since the convention organizers paid for my trip, staying here was fine, but if we return to San Francisco, we'll probably choose a cheaper place to bunk down at night.",21-Feb-16,4
"Hotel location is superb, staff very efficient, although check in can be crowded, rooms very comfortable, bathroom may not be at the expected level, but overall a sensational stay and relatively good value.",21-Feb-16,5
"Where to stay in San Francisco? Well the Grand Hyatt was not bad. Our room was comfortable with a nice view. The location was great, right in the center of everything. We jumped on a cable car a block over, walked to Sears for breakfast, walked to Chinatown, etc. And the concierges very helpful.I'd stay again.",21-Feb-16,4
"This is the second stay at the Grand Hyatt, equally satisfying as the first. The construction of the newest Apple Store next door caused minimal inconvenience. Staff made me feel as though I was the only guest. Concierge staff was excellent",21-Feb-16,5
"I have been traveling to San Francisco and Union Square for years, and have experienced many hotels. However, the Hyatt is the only choice for me. Location, great service, and the new remodel place it far ahead of the competition.",21-Feb-16,5
"Not a bad experience, but this Hyatt property cannot compete with other true high-end hotel properties. I thought that is what the ""Grand"" Hyatt brand was supposed to do? Room service was nice, though (quality of food and service) and the hotel staff was nicely attentive and helpful.",21-Feb-16,3
"Have been staying here on and off for years. Recent renos have updated the rooms. This hotel is centrally located at Union Square. Walking distance to shopping, Chinatown, Nob Hill and North Beach. The Trocadero and Fishermans wharf 20-30 minute walk or approx $10 cab. Lots of cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood and a Starbucks across the street. ",20-Feb-16,4
"Stayed for a few nights on business and over-all a good stay. Rooms are nice and comfortable and hotel is in a good location. The only issue was I went to go have a breakfast meeting one morning and the restaurant is quite small and I had to wait for a table. I ended up down the street so we didn't have to wait. Gym is also pretty tight - equipment and weights were OK, but very tight space.",19-Feb-16,4
"Bedroom furnishings badly needed renewing . Television so modern everything such as room service had to be done online. This unfortunately was beyond us. Despite calling reception who passed us to someone else who could not take us through it , it took almost one hour to have a room service menu delivered. Part of the problem was language We should have asked for in room dining then restaurant staff would have understood us. We were very tired after long flight so all we wanted was something quick!!!!!",18-Feb-16,3
"Room was very nice, clean and contemporary but then you flush toilet and its so loud i think people walking by could hear it...very strange. Otherwise like everyone else says location is perfect to shopping and restaurants and near enough to business district that you can walk to your meetings after grabbing a starbuck""s coffee across the street.",17-Feb-16,4
"It was a perfect hotel on a perfect location. I really recommend. it. Don`t miss the terrace restaurant, great food with a great view! Lo.cated at the Union Square it`s easy to go wherever you want in San Francisco. You can see a lot by foot.",17-Feb-16,4
"This is our second rating of this hotel, the last being in 2014. Like all hotels around Union Square rates are based on supply and demand. We do find though, that we often get a very good rate for this hotel which is in such a great location within the city. Beside in the heart of Union Square, a short walk through the tunnel (or over the tunnel) puts you right in Chinatown. Just a bit longer walk (or short cab/bus ride) you are in North Beach or the Embarcadero. Great restaurants around and night life can be found atop a few of the nearby hotels like the Starlite room, just a block away. The layout and design of the hotel is very modern and the rooms non-traditional, most all of them with some sort of a great view. Service is excellent and the bar (OneUp) is very nice, but with the usual high hotel prices. Parking is available at some nearby parking garages, one just kitty-corner from the hotel is your best option. Excellent hotel, great value!",17-Feb-16,5
"I traditionally stay at either the Grand Hyatt or the Hyatt Embarcadero. WIth the renovation, the Grand Hyatt's rooms are very comfortable, easy to set up for work and the room service menu (although somewhat limited) is enhanced by a thoughtful staff.",16-Feb-16,5
"Had to call twice for something (i.e. towels, car..) and late checkout (2pm) offered by the front desk seems to never properly communicate with House-keeping (HS). HS will either come by n check prior to check out time at 12 or be irritated that u r still in your room.",15-Feb-16,2
Hotel room on small side but probable normal for SF. Newly refurbished and decor modern and tasteful. Powershades with remote controls by door and bed but you have to find that out yourself. Bed very comfortable and room and bathroom well equipped. Wake up service is tenacious: called me 3 times then knocked on the door when I didn't answer. Computer services and TV/video good.,15-Feb-16,5
We go to the city for cultural events and always stay at The Hyatt. Easy drive in park your car and enjoy San Francisco. Good location. The people are friendly and helpful. The restaurant is convenient and the food well prepared.,14-Feb-16,5
"I was pleasantly surprised by this Hyatt. It is on Union center. The staff was very helpful. The view from the room was incredible. The workout room was on 35th floor and all glass walls. Be sure to go to 36th floor observatory deck with 360 degree views of SF. If you have choice to face the Bay or Union Square, I enjoyed union Square side but you can't go wrong.",13-Feb-16,5
"Perfectly located, half block from Union Square. Very friendly and helpful staff. Buffet breakfast is good. The view of the city from 36 floor is awesome. Rooms and bathroom are very spacious and clean. Only beware of sending packages by ups because they charge $5 per package. ",13-Feb-16,5
"Nicely located hotel with very central location right on Union Sq. Check in was very quick and very informal they even had hyatt no which I had forgotten to enter. Room was nice and clean, but slightly small. Bathroom was small very outdated as compare to room. Room service menu is very limited and very pricey.",11-Feb-16,4
"We stayed here in May. The facilities were great. The location was great. We opted for the club with penthouse facilities, including food and drinks. It was a great perk. The views up there were second to none. Would go back.",10-Feb-16,5
"True Rating: 4.3 circles for a centrally located, modern hotel with uber-friendly staff, especially ""Maria T."" at the front-desk (more on her later), clean, comfortable room with a stunning North-bay view. We wish there was a pool or better fitness center, but for many travelers, these may be non-issues.The Good: Easily, the staff ... ""Maria T."" at the front desk charmingly greeted us with a smile, engaging in genuine conversation about many things, and diligently worked to find THE room for us. She also resolved our Gold-Passport membership discrepancy (computer mismatch) quickly, provided us with the room we preferred, and assured us of our access to the Grand Club. She was terrific! To top it all, she delivered a card to our room, apologizing again for the discrepancy, following up & assuring us of the correction, and offered her card for assistance with anything beyond. Now, many of you cynics may say...it was just a standard-obligatory card for their error ... be assured, it was a very caring hand-written long note from her ... thought-out with expression of genuine hospitality that caught us for a smile. Thank you Maria !! Now, beyond her ... the rest of the staff was also very polite, friendly, and smiled during their greetings when encountering us in the elevators/halls, from doormen, to cleaning or maintenance staff, to servers, to Club hosts, even though we were meeting for the first time nor requesting any service ... this becoming less common in the hospitality industry. Moving on to the second 'good' = location: Smack in the center of downtown SF... below is Union Square, surrounded by mid-to-high-end shopping within easy walk, and easy access to the rest of SF - plenty of public transportation options to get to all sightseeing, or convention center...super-convenient and efficient for night life. Moving on to the room: stunning, picturesque, sweeping, birds-eye Northern view of the bay, laid out by your large windows - dotted with the Coit Tower, Transmerica building, Alcatraz Island, Nob Hill area, Chinatown gate below, etc.... though the room is not large, it is clean & comfortable with a King bed - very sleep-inducing worthy, incorporating full credenza that houses a desk/work area, an in-room safe, a small fridge, along with a nice large, wide lounge chair + ottoman for comfortable TV watching or reading. Strong, consistent - free WiFi included. The bathroom was clean, bright and spotless, with a glass-shower stall, large boat-like sink, (2) robes and basic toiletries. The room is modernly 'dressed' in muted tones of brown, orange & white, with push-button shades and lights at your bedside (nice!!). The Grand Club was terrific, with very friendly, attentive & gracious hosts who kept the food and drinks well stocked, and tables spotless.The Not-So-Good: Some minor minuses we noted that took our rating from perfection: We wish there was a pool. We also wished for a better chair for the desk/work area. The low-back rolling chair was not very comfortable to work with, especially for longer durations. We also wished the fitness center was larger ... basically, just adequate. Do note: on the South side - facing Union Square, the area is going through some subway construction 2 blocks away, and there is construction of a building (new Apple store?) literally, next door, but we were not effected, as we were on the other side. Not the hotel's fault, but for your awareness.Overall: Terrific stay at this hotel, and as you will note above, no real complaints. This location, for your events, whether shopping, sightseeing, convention, or just to visit friends in the area, is most convenient and efficient. We were very happy with the staff's friendliness and warmth, even though we did not request anything or required any services. A great sign that their staff were genuine (Maria-front desk) or well-trained, or both. It may be a little pricier than some, but deals are to be had ... we got a good deal. We recommend a stay here when you travel to SF.Happy Hotel-ing!",8-Feb-16,4
"Great stay from the time I pulled up until I left. Only issue was with construction I was not sure where to pull up for valet service, no signs. I would highly recommend this hotel to any visitor to the city of San Francisco... I've stayed in many hotels in SF and this was by far the best.",3-Feb-16,5
"The hotel staying was OK, room is clean with pretty completed facilities. However, we get shock for a hidden rule when I do my checkout. We were planing to stay 5 days but last minute decide to check out one day earlier, but the hotel insisted to charge me 5 days. I got the room from expedia and they never state in the rules say that checking out earlier will get penalty, I have been traveling and staying different hotels for 7 years in different regions, this is the first time I heard that I cannot check out earlier. This is really ridiculous especially their font office manager told us this is their (Grand Hyatt San Francisco) rule and they don't care other hotels' practice when we were trying to talk to her. I hope whoever would like to stay this hotel be warned for it if you think you may need to change your schedule because there is no place to remind you for this rule.",2-Feb-16,1
A quick business trip was extra special with a view of union square and a walk around the long square block. We stay at Grand Hyatt again and again. Breakfast at Sears Fine Foods rounded out our overnight stay.,2-Feb-16,5
"Great place to stay depending on your budget. Little expensive, but you're paying for location!! Staff is fantastic!!! Rooms are nice, except the bathrooms. Since they have a sliding barn door design with no locks, it makes it hard for a little privacy. Also, no vents in the bathrooms... Other then those little quirks. Would stay again. Also, here's a tip for parking if you have a car. DO NOT valid your car! They charge over $60 for an over nite. They is a public parking lot diagonal from the hotel. It's safe and clean and much cheaper. Park it there! This is were the Hyatt parks it anyway..lol",1-Feb-16,4
"perfect in cleaness, quietfulness, services in general, location. Very friendliy,warm attention. I didnÂ´t like to pay USD 5 for receiving each package of purchasing things. I have been in the Marriot Hotel in the same location and the packages service is for free.",1-Feb-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco was truly Five Star in all respects, from Check-in, to Suite, to Gold Passport Club, to Check-out, a Perfect San Francisco Experience. I would recommend this Property to anyone wanting an Excellent Property in a fantastic, convenient location.",1-Feb-16,5
"The staff are uniquely nice and the location is very central. So when also considering the nice views, cozy bar, versatile restaurant and high standard rooms this hotel offers, you can only be a fan. Great for short stays no matter if it is business or pleasure.",31-Jan-16,5
"The staff are friendly, the location is good, the gym is a real disappointement, its tiny and cramped and utilises the lift lobby to try and compensate. Not what you would expect from a Hyatt or for the price.",31-Jan-16,3
"I have stayed here 3 times when visiting SFO. Love it. I cannot fault it. The rooms are amazing, clean, with lots of extras; bar, wifi, nice widescreen TV and big clean comfy beds. The rooms are spotlessly clean. The hotel has recently had the lobby renovated, it's very trendy. Amazing views from the high bay facing rooms. The staff are excellent. Good location. I cannot fault this hotel and would love to stay here every time I visit SFO, budget allowing!!",30-Jan-16,5
"This will be my 5th time to stay at this beautiful, convenient, clean hotel with an amazing staff. Oh, yes, the views are spectacular! !! From the moment you arrive at the entrance to the departure, it is a memorable experience. Last year my 89-year old sister was with my daughter and me. Staff had to handle a wheelchair in addition to luggage of 3 prissy ladies. Not one complaint, rather laughter and graciousness. ..I am so excited to be staying again for my 74th birthday",30-Jan-16,5
"I was here with my husband and 1 year old in June and then again by myself for work in November. The staff is fantastic! They were so friendly and accommodating! They made sure we had everything we needed for our little one including changing out pack n play sheets. We always had what we needed and if we didn't, it was brought up quickly. The concierge is great and always has good food and fun ideas.The location is great! Right in Union Square with tons of restaurants and shopping. There was construction in the neighborhood both times, but never heard any inside of the hotel and it was not in the way. Thanks so much Grand Hyatt!",30-Jan-16,5
"We were in SF celebrating the release of my wife's book, ""If Something Should Happen: a Travel Insurance Disaster"". Upgraded to the Grand Club level and it was well worth it. Great room, the Grand Club is beautiful with a fantastic view out over the Bay and The City.",30-Jan-16,5
"We arrived at the Grand Hyatt after a 4 hr flight delay, late in the evening, with a sick daughter. The front desk staff were warm and welcoming, getting my daughter a bottle of water and immediately upgrading our room to a higher floor with a city view. Rooms are well equipped and have been refurbished by the look. Other reviews mention noise, however we found the rooms to be very quiet compared to other hotels we stayed in. Rooms are very clean and look like new. Location is spot on for tourists with plenty of shopping and the trolley cars less than a block away. The mezzanine level bar and restaurant are relaxed and have good atmosphere. Food is OK but you will pay for it, especially if you order room service. All in all we had a great experience here and would definitely go back.",29-Jan-16,5
"For pampering and feeling like you are a hundred miles away from home I suggest experiencing a weekend at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. Service and staff are customer service orientated in all departments, they go over and above.",29-Jan-16,5
"Great stay. Wonderful staff and steps away from the heart of San Francisco, Newly remodeled, the room was up to date and had tons of plugs. May seem trivial, but a real pus for a business hotel. Staff was top notch without any stuffy attitude. Another plus.",28-Jan-16,5
"The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that it is well located. The cleanliness of the rooms leaves much to be desired. They don't have all day room service which is a must in any 4 star hotel and will not accomodate so much as a cup of tea should you request it outside their service hours. The Club room is not worth the extra cost as it too is not too clean and the selection of food offered is very poor. It could be a Hyatt, but definitely not a Grand Hyatt",27-Jan-16,3
"This was our first time at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco and I planned a special trip to celebrate my mom's birthday. I travel to the Bay Area often for work and always stay at the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental but after this stay, I truly believe I am a convert now. We had a fabulous experience; from the warm, friendly & professional greeting by Maria at the front desk to the nice Doormen and Bell Desk to talking to the manager at OneUp Restaurant. We dined at OneUp for my mom's birthday and the food and service were excellent and I look forward to dining there again! All the special touches were extremely appreciated and I definitely plan on returning. Thank you for an incredible and truly memorable experience!",27-Jan-16,5
"Although I live in San Francisco, I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt several times, the most recent being this past weekend for the two-day Edwardian Ball. My weekend at the hotel consisted of almost non-stop getting ready (hours of makeup, costumes, etc.) or taking everything off, getting cleaned up, and sleeping (from 4:30AM to 10AM). Everything had to happen like clockwork and the staff at the Grand Hyatt did their part to make that happen - from check-in to in-room meals, bell service (arrival and departure), car valet, and the maids. They made me feel like a true guest, which let me focus on the things I needed to get done and having some fun in the process. On the downside, traffic can be an issue due to subway construction in the area, but other than that, I can't imagine my stay at the Grand Hyatt being any better than it was. Highly Recommended!",27-Jan-16,5
"We stayed here over MLK weekend for several nights and had a wonderful stay in part to Ashley in the front and Jason through the VIB program. They made sure that the room was clean and ready for our daughter. From the start, we were waiting to check in and a front desk attendant immediately brought her a coloring book and some crayons. We were put in a room with the view of Union Square and a huge star which our daughter loved to stare at. We did have an issue with the creakiness of our bed and they ended up bringing in a brand new mattress and box springs. The housekeeper at the time helped to facilitate this whole process and make sure the bed was cleaned out underneath as well. It is when you have staff noticing these details that you know they want their guests to be comfortable and happy. We loved the location which is a close walk to many attractions. We especially liked the close proximity to Boba Guys and After Osha. There is slight congestion in the front since there is not drive so can be a bit difficult to get off a taxi/uber during busy times. Overall the hotel is beautiful and the staff is friendly and helpful. My daughter loved going to the lounge and saying hello to the staff who remembered her each day.",26-Jan-16,5
"We stayed here for three nights in January. The staff configured the room differently to what was agreed, they couldn't find a parcel delivered to the hotel for us and when they finally did find it they charged us a handling fee. The lounge was just the bare essentials and the check in and check out took way too long.",25-Jan-16,3
"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt for a conference. The location, right on Union Square, was great and the lobby, bar,lounge area are very nice. We had a room on the 12th floor and it was large with a nice view. The king bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom and bath products were very nice. The major rub was the construction noise all day long right outside our window. The construction had jack hammers, air horns, etc... and it was started around 7am every day including sunday. The hotel does supply ear plugs so clearly they are aware of this situation.The work out room on the 35th floor was great and both my husband and I enjoyed the amenities and equipment there. We had drinks at the bar and while the drinks were delicious, the bartender could not have been more unfriendly. I would recommend this hotel to friends and we may stay here when we come again next year. I just hope the construction is gone.",25-Jan-16,4
"We stayed here overnight last weekend and we were woken up early in the morning due to the construction going on next door. Please note that this was a Saturday morning, when I would expect everyone to be off work but it just wasn't the case. Overally, I love staying at Hyatts and the interior is very nice and contemporary but the current construction conditions make this place not recommendable.",25-Jan-16,2
"Rooms have been refurbished and offer enough space. They were clean. Soundproofing is terrible as Hyatt kept the old, single glazed windows. You will thus be exposed to street noise even on the highest floors.Gym is average and floor was dirty - a real shame given its location on a top floor.Breakfast and housekeeping staff lack even rudimentary manners of politeness and courtesy. Greetings are reduced to ""how many are you?"" instead of ""Good morning.."" at breakfast whilst the breakfast service is terrible and the restaurant far too small for the hotel. Staff training needs improvement except for the concierge and receptionists.",25-Jan-16,3
A building construction project located directly next door goes on through about 3:00 to 4:00-am. Sleeping is impossible and all rooms located in close proximity should not be rented or rented only after a warning and at a heavy rental discount.,25-Jan-16,2
"Hotel room was good, towels, bedding, toiletries were good. Not a very inviting lobby. They should move the restaurant to the top floor, gym is ok, not exceptional. Compared to other hotels in SF, it is a good value.",24-Jan-16,3
"This is by far the best hotel in San Francisco. The rooms are bright, comfortable, and modern. Stayed in room 2802 which overlooked Union Square and the Drake. Floor to ceiling windows for exceptional light. Door windows crack open a few inches to allow air flow. There is a tendency to feel movement in the building but it is a high building building which catches the wind. Beds are awsome.",24-Jan-16,5
"We have stayed in a few different rooms at this hotel. Each has had its personality and quirks. One had a problem with the tub. When you stood in it, the bottom felt like it had a hole underneath it and made a loud pop when you would move your foot. Very annoying when you are trying to take a shower. In another room the tv remote did not work. In still another room there was a layer of thick dust on the carpet around the bed. The walls are paper thin and your can hear everything going on in rooms and in hallways, coughing, sneezing, clearing of the throat etc. Now for the good.Great location and views. You are near shopping and restaurants and convenience stores. The views of the bay and city are great and their floor to ceiling windows add to the view to be enjoyed. The staff is very friendly and helpful although I think they are skilled in making you feel like you are getting something extra when you really are getting what you paid for. Overall I would stay here again but don't expect too much pampering and wow factor here.",21-Jan-16,3
"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt a few times and always find the staff very helpful and courteous.The location is excellent with a short walk to Union square and the rooms are spotlessly clean, modern and very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel.",21-Jan-16,5
"My wife and I spent a single night at this hotel to avoid two round trips from the San Jose area to attend San Francisco-based events.Room with view of Union Square was quite nice and clean and unlike many other hotels switching to LED lighting, well-lit. The location is fantastic, right off of Union Square and walking distance to most shopping, theatres, the Moscone Center, etc.Excellent night's sleep although potential guest should be aware of major construction adjacent to this hotel (both new building and new transit lines). The loud noise starts at 7:00am and goes through about 5:00pm. This is not the hotel's fault (you can't soundproof against this magnitude of noise), but nonetheless, this is the wrong place to stay if you need to sleep late.As part of the San Francisco political correctness thing, guests are notified that unless you otherwise call housekeeping and request otherwise, towels are changed only every other day. OK, no problem with that EXCEPT that the bathroom (at least the bathroom for our room) had absolutely no towel rack. There was no place to hang a towel to dry and save for reuse! Duh!?!?The hotel provides internet access. However, our experience was that it was exceptionally unreliable. When it was up, speed was good. But gradually access slowed to the point where it was totally unusable (disconnects from e-mail servers), unable to reach any websites, etc. Then it suddenly comes alive again and the process of gradual degradation begins anew. This is totally unacceptable for business travelers who much count on continual high speed internet access. And it certainly is not the standard one would expect for rooms going for well over $400 per night! Whether it is a router problem or simply not enough bandwidth, this problem needs to be fixed.Note that this hotel has no driveway. The front door is right on Stockton Street with limited curb space to stop and either discharge or pickup guests and their luggage. There are several local parking garages, but given the traffic issues, I would recommend their valet parking, albeit at over $60/day.",21-Jan-16,3
"my guest was bitten through out her whole body.. ecolab was sent out, they did nothing besides that. the manager was extremely rude.. we had to stay out of our room for hours for testing, they didn't even offer to move us to another room, absolutely terrible",21-Jan-16,1
I stayed at the Hyatt and had a very pleasant stay. The bellmen and front desk people were very helpful and nice. The room was very comfortable. The hotel is in a great location. The lady at the concierge was very helpful in picking a restaurant to eat at for dinner. I would stay here again! ,20-Jan-16,4
"Stayed in room 1018 in mid Jan 2016. The hotel and location are very nice, clean, and convenient. Unfortunately several factors contributed to a below average experience. If you are a light sleeper, be aware. The actual construction is not the hotel's fault, but I feel that some warning, during booking, should have been given. There is a large construction project underway, right across the street. The project is so noisy, that our room came with complimentary ear plugs! Trucks were backing in and out during the night, so the reverse gear beeping was pretty constant. Then at around 8am, the pile driving started. We were barely able to sleep, and were being awakened constantly, by the construction noise. Booked a king, but was given a room with 2 double beds. Not queens, doubles. I protested, but was informed that those were the only rooms available. Good luck having a comfortable/romantic weekend with someone, while sleeping in separate beds. I suggest calling ahead, and verifying that you will receive the actual room you booked. Other than calling ahead, I not sure what other options you have, if they don't have your booked room available. Room was average. Wi-Fi included. Very low pressure shower, with a tub.Single sink, with minimal counter space. Hotel bar was nice. Upper scale, but table seating was uncomfortable. Sitting at the bar would be your best bet. ",20-Jan-16,2
"I was in the city the weekend of 1/15/2016 - 1/17/2016 For a holiday party for my work. My Company ""blocked"" out room reservations at The Grand Hyatt and I will never stay at another hotel in SF. Amazing experiance",19-Jan-16,5
"Stayed here for a week after Christmas through New Year's Day. Checked in and was given the 36th floor. Our room overlooked union square and was fantastic to see the lights, tree, and ice skating rink. Since we are a Diamond member, I was able to obtain a DSU only a few weeks before our stay. We could of asked for a better room and suite. The stay was friendly and accommodating. The hotel was very busy for r weekend. I think the only problem is it too just about 5 hour to get a rollaway bed. Executive floor had a lounge however it was always super crowded. Can't imagine there is that many diamond members or the hotel just gave it away to everyone. I would make it more exclusive for elites. The staff worked hard to keep food and drinks replenished and to keep the tables clear. Elite breakfast was in the same lounge. I'd recommend breakfast be an option in the restaurant on oversold and crowded days. Again hotel front desk, operators, valet, bellman, everyone was super friendly. Will stay at is hotel again for either business or so the family again soon.",18-Jan-16,5
"Currently construction out front making it nearly impossible to unload as you arrive. Rooms are renovated but you can hear every single word of the person in the room next to you talking at a normal volume. Great views, good club food and honor bar, but far too loud to sleep.",17-Jan-16,3
"The location of this hotel is hard to beat; it's right on Union Square. Also, as the building is taller than any adjacent building, rooms in upper floors have pretty awesome views to the city (and beyond).The rooms are just what one would expect from a Grand Hyatt; modern, clean, well equipped and spacious.",17-Jan-16,5
"Exactly what I hoped for. A modern, clean place right in the centre. Lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Great staff, quick check in. Very nice room with comfy beds, electric shades, safe, fridge, nice flat screen TV. Room service was good too although a bit expensive (all the extra charges really add up). Only disappointment was the breakfast: tried the bagel with cream cheese (a la carte): the bagel was dry and hard and the cream cheese terrible.",16-Jan-16,4
"A return trip to San Francisco after many years and I decided to stay at what had been my favorite hotel over a long period of frequent visits to this magnificent city. A bit of disappointment greeted me as the top floor restaurant and the mezzanine breakfast terrace are no longer there, hence my 4 rating. Yet the impeccable and exceptional service by the personnel, the magnificent views from my room and the location still makes this hotel the one to stay when visiting San Francisco. ",16-Jan-16,4
"Right on Union Square, walking distance to Chinatown, Market St, shops, restaurants, and many other attractions. An updated hotel, very nice lobby. Helpful and friendly front desk staff. Self park is just across the intersection. Rooms are contemporary, electric shade over the window. Comfortable bed, quiet room. Modern and updated bathroom.",15-Jan-16,4
This was my first stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco - having traveled there in the past - I was always looking for a hotel I would look forward to staying with again. I now found my preferred location. The Grand Hyatt is centrally located and a serves as great hub to see all of San Fran. The staff was helpful in recommending both local spots as well as a ton of terrific destinations just outside of the city.,15-Jan-16,5
"Affordable and very nice. Had a little construction going on, kept me up in the afternoon when I went to take a nap. Staff more than took care of it for me!  All staff very good! Rooms nice and clean. Everyone went the extra mile. Excellent location. Clean and moderately upscale. Very good value.Ill be back!",14-Jan-16,4
You have to get to the top floor. I think it is 36. A beautiful view of the harbor and Alcatraz. The hotel is a block from Union square which now has an out door ice rink. Very nice hotel with very friendly staff.,14-Jan-16,4
Have been a frequent guest at this property. Of the three Hyatt's in SFO this is by far the best and most central location. It is perfectly located for easy access to all major SFO attractions and an easy cab ride or Uber to those a little further away.,14-Jan-16,5
"Located in the heart of Union Square, the Grand Hyatt offers everything that the other luxury hotels offer but for over $100 less. Mid-week prices are higher for business travelers as they are everywhere in the city, but weekends are especially attractively priced. You are right next to the cable car turnaround and the best shopping of the Union Square experience. It's central to Market Street and the local theaters and museums. For my money I think it is the best locale in the city. Ask for a high floor with a bay view and you will have great city views out your floor-to-ceiling windows, and be away from street noise. Parking is high-priced but there's a lot just around the corner off Stockton for half the price. I live in the Bay Area so we frequently travel to the city. For the city views, service, and the location, I don't think the Gr. Hyatt can be beat. Plus, the hotel offers promotions often, so be sure to book directly with the hotel itself rather than the booking websites because it won't be cheaper and it's a whole lot easier to solve any issues when you book direct with the hotel.",13-Jan-16,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco was wonderful in every way. From the doorman who helped with our luggage and parking to the reception at check in who gave us s beautiful room facing the ice skating rink in Union Square. The location couldn't be better for shopping, food and sightseeing. We walked and took the Cable Cars all over the city. Our family was so sad to leave.",13-Jan-16,5
"This hotel feels more like a Marriott than a Grand Hyatt. It is a good hotel to stay in, has all you need but just didn't feel ""grand"". Location is convenient too. It's a good business hotel and for short leisure stays is good. It's an efficient hotel and breakfast was good.",11-Jan-16,3
"I like the location (close to main streets/shopping/offices), food (restaurant is great), pleasant amenities (extras/things I forget are available), style/decor (modern but classy), staff (from front desk to room service).",11-Jan-16,5
"Great customer service! Room was very clean with great view of the city. I will definitely look into staying at this Hyatt the next time I'm in San Francisco, and I would definitely recommend it to family and friends.",11-Jan-16,5
"I like the hotel a lot. I travel around the world. It is usually not easy to find a good quality hotel in the states. Even luxury brands are mediocre. I believe the hotel is refurbished in recent years and the room standard is comparable to Asian hotels. Service is top-notch. There are always doorman to open the door for the guests. The hotel is right next to the Union Square, means it is a great location for shopping. The views from higher floor rooms are just fantastic.One thing could be improved is the breakfast offerings in the grand club. I stayed for four days and every morning the offerings are the same.",10-Jan-16,5
"The location is the best in Union Square. Every major shopping mall is across the street with Barneys, Neimans, Saks, basically shopping heaven. The views are amazing from the room. The gym is kinda small but its ok. The hotel is super clean and modern. Its way better than the Westin Hotel across the street. The prices are quite decent here. There is a restaurant here and the food is pretty good. The staff is really nice. There is a construction in front of the hotel with the biggest Apple Store coming in and also the subway construction will be done in 2017 or something so Union Square is kinda loud. But other than that, the hotel is great!",8-Jan-16,5
My overall experience of staying at Grand Hyatt at San Francisco is very satisfied. The staff members are very friendly and take care all you concerns. The hotel is located in the central of the city. Highly recommended.,8-Jan-16,5
"Friendly staff, complimentary wi-fi, and overall good experience. It really needs a complimentary breakfast (as do nearly all other high end hotels in the US). At the minimum, please have a table with bananas, oranges, apples, etc. so that people can just take and go.",8-Jan-16,4
"Beautiful hotel, excellent customer service from check-in to check-out, excellent breakfast. It is pricey but typical rates for downtown San Fran. Hotel gives you ear plugs in your room in the event you need them but I found my room to be very quiet. Room temperature was set to 70 degrees, which it maintained a comfortable temperature without constant adjustment and air constantly blowing on your face. Views from room were great too. Electric blinds controllable from bedside was a nice added feature. Great stay!",8-Jan-16,5
"The staff at this hotel is very friendly and it seemed like it was renovated recently. The guest bathrooms are nice and modern with fancy fixtures and the bed was comfortable, but the rest of the furniture in the guest rooms is cheap and has not worn well at all. The guest rooms seemed to be cleaned ok but the public spaces--especially the guest room floors need a lot more attention from the cleaning crew. I was there 4 days and three nights (and in the hotel most of the time) and I never once saw anyone vacuuming or mopping the floors in the common areas.",7-Jan-16,3
"The hotel is in an excellent location, overall it is an attractive hotel and has a pleasant atmosphere, we enjoyed having drinks at the lounge. The hotel staff was kind and professional. The only negative review was about the rooms, they were small and beds were uncomfortable.",6-Jan-16,4
"We stayed here for one night because our hotel was overbooked so we decided we'd stay here because of the great location.The airline had sent our bags in a different flight so we had to wait till the next day to get them because they said they'd ship them to the hotel (meaning the one we were supposed to stay in). When we told this to a man working at this hotel he told us not to worry and when we got to our room, there was a know on the door and they brought us toothbrushes, deodorants, creams, toothpaste, band aids, shaving creams, gillette's, and more things (all for free) and we thought that was an incredibly nice gesture and it saved our night!The hotel is really nice, the staff is helpful (I can't remember that one guy's name but he was incredibly nice), the rooms are spacious and good for allergic people (like me) because of an air cleanser they have which I found to be really cool and thoughtful.After we'd checked out we decided to go shopping for about 4 hours and asked if we could leave our belongings in the reception area for them to hold them for us and they did which made life easier for us, so I would recommend this hotel (even if it is a bit expensive). We had an amazing stay, even if it was just for a night.",6-Jan-16,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt while attending a conference in January, 2015. I was very impressed with the staff when I checked in and out. My room was immaculate and I loved the look and feel. The bed and pillows were most comfortable. My only regret is that I didn't get a room on a higher floor so I could have enjoyed a great view, too.",6-Jan-16,5
"This was a really nice hotel - clean, quiet. They gave away warm cookies and hot chocolate in the lobby on New Years Day - it was a nice touch. Everyone was very friendly. The room had updated bathrooms and nice storage. The shades were automatic from a touch of a button which was nice too",5-Jan-16,5
"We attended the Top Shelf New Year's Party at the Grand Ballroom of the Grand Hyatt. We wanted to stay at the same venue, especially since it was New Year's. The staff was very welcoming and friendly.",4-Jan-16,4
"Hotel check in started off bad as I was initially under impression I had used a DSU and was booked into a suite. I was excited to use this as I was traveling with my wife. At check in they let me know that it was not available but I could get access to the grand club ( A general perk of being diamond )Hotel room was stuffy and not cleaned thoroughly. The next day we were asked to change rooms because of a plumbing issue. My wife wasnt thrilled but thankfully the hotel comped us the 2nd night. Next the heater didnt work in the new room and had to call down to get fixed. My wife let them know that we prefer for them to come when we leave ( which we told her was in 30 minutes. Within a couple of minutes the engineer comes knocking on our door...Lastly, at checkout they had the wrong total on my bill but thankfully it was a quick fix. Having previously stayed at the Grand Hyatt DFW and the Fairmont Kea Lani, this hotel has a large amount of work to do.",4-Jan-16,2
"My family and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt hotel in SF for the first time and had an absolutely Grand New Year's Eve celebration that lasted through the following weekend. The hotel was centrally located to almost everything we had hoped to visit in San Francisco. It was only a block away from the famous Union Square, where there was an outdoor ice skating; the marvelously Grand, Huge, Christmas tree; all the fine shopping and dining you can ask for. There was literally something for everyone in my family to do! The service at the hotel was exceptional, from the doormen who never ceased to greet us with a genuine smile , while cheerfully opening the front entrance doors for everyone, to the very helpful concierge, housekeeping, and front desk teams. Our room was very clean and had a beautiful view of the Transamerica pyramid and a partial view of the Northeast section of the bay. The beds were comfortable which made for a very restful night. Staying at the Grand Hyatt was an absolute Grand experience.",4-Jan-16,5
"Very helpful staff, we stayed from Christmas Day until New Year's Day. Despite being understaffed, all of the employees were helpful and pleasant. Rooms are really nice and location is fantastic. We booked somewhat late but enjoyed a very good rate.",3-Jan-16,5
"I cannot thank the front desk staff enough. There are excellent. There was a bit of a problem with the room booking and the staff worked very hard to resolve the problem and ensure that our stay was wonderful. All the staff were very nice, but the front desk staff were miracle workers.",3-Jan-16,5
"We rented 2 rooms for a 5 day vacation at the Hyatt in the week between Christmas and New Years and were overall quite pleased. I've been staying at this Hyatt for over 10 years for business and knew a bit of what to expect. The first (and, to an extent, persistent) impression is one of crowded chaos. There is almost no space on Stockton for taxis or private vehicles to unload and the adjacent construction aggravates that. I suspect that after the holidays things become a bit more orderly. The lobby is quite small relative to the number of rooms and the front desk was wisely replaced with several staffed & automated kiosks to help mitigate the very long lines that can extend into the elevator landing. All that said, everything from valet parking, bag check and check-in moves surprisingly quickly. Don't be alarmed if you walk in to a huge line - it moves quickly. Our rooms on the 32nd (club King) and 26th (double) floors were clean, reasonably large and outfitted with very nice, modern furnishings. This includes some fun modern tech touches like a smart-TV with keyboard, wall-buttons to lower the blinds and Bluetooth enabled door locks. The bed was wonderfully soft with crisp linens. The bathroom was a little small but the all-glass shower and full length mirror made it feel a bit larger. Also, kudos to the management for installing free, albeit small, refrigerators for guest use rather than the rip-off minibars that some properties insist on imposing on guests. The only issue I would have with the rooms is the lack of drawer storage space. My only complaint about the Hyatt is the massively-oversold Club lounge on the 32nd floor. I was under the impression that there were a small handful of floors with upgraded rooms that included Club access for light snacks and drinks. In fact, every time we visited it was shoulder-to-shoulder with no place to sit and families with lots of kids eating full meals at the tables. During our stay we regularly rode the elevator down with other guests carrying toâ€“go containers overflowing with the club snacks. The management really needs to rethink the mission of this space as it doesn't make anyone happy as it is. Business travelers are hugely frustrated by the constant daycare atmosphere and family's are attempting to feed their children bar snacks instead of a pricey San Francisco restaurant meal. The highlight of the Hyatt is doubtlessly the staff. Every person we had contact with was 1) friendly, 2) helpful, and, 3) made certain our needs were met. I'd particularly note that the Club lounge staff worked extremely hard to clear plates, replenish serving containers and act as concierges while being uniformly friendly and upbeat (even when, quite literally, working up a sweat). ",2-Jan-16,4
"This hotel just has. The best location when visiting SF. But the hotel is very busy and the staff isn't as responsive as you would have expected. We had booked a room for three people, but there was only sleeping places for two - at e reception they didn't say that even it was quite evident at check-in. Over the next 5 hours we contacted guest services 4-5 times (incl mgt) to get an extra bed, with limited effect. Very disappointing way to start a vacation. In addition, the rooms are quite poorly insulated, so expect some noise from street/hallway",2-Jan-16,3
"We chose the Grand Hyatt because of its location. Our view was sensational - overlooking union square with the ice rink and Macy's in the background. It was a great place to stay right before Christmas. Rooms were ""luxurious"", clean and comfortable. Beds were great and the club room was very nice. I highly recommend. View from the top floor was sensational.",1-Jan-16,5
"Close to all of the shopping and a couple of blocks from trolley lines, it is our first choice here. Staff at curb and bellmen were all excellent under stressful conditions as many cars arrived close in time. In-room service was prompt and food was hot and of excellent quality. Our room on the 25th floor had a perfect view of Union Square!",31-Dec-15,5
The construction started pretty early and it woke me up around 5:30am both mornings. Stayed on the Union Sq view side. I wish there was a note on the construction so I would choose city view instead for the same price.,31-Dec-15,4
"the room was clean and comfortable and the price (approx. $200 per night) was good for the hotel's excellent location...every year we stay at this hotel (or the nearby marriot) to do our christmas shopping and enjoy our favorite restaurants in SFthe staff is friendly and helpful,,,in-room wifi was acceptable and freethe parking is way too expensive...catch a taxi somewhere else to avoid the costs of getting out of the Union Square mess...3 blocks will cost you $10+",30-Dec-15,4
very nice. great location.staff very accommodating. Right by great but expensive shopping. Far enough away but no too far from the crazy crowded pier area. Free breakfast was very nice but room too small-not enough tables for all. Would s\tay here again,29-Dec-15,5
"We came during holiday (Dec 28), and the hotel was very busy. We did not get help with our luggage as what we expected for the usual 5-star hotel. We were waiting for the valet guys who were overwhelemed helping other people. I have parked my car and what they need to do was just giving me the valet ticket. But it did not happen. It might not be their fault but I expect them to be trained and prepared for holiday season. The valet guy finally apologized for the delay.The waiting did not stop there. I was waiting for my rolling bed for more than 3 hours. The receptionist changed my reservation from double bed room to king size and promised to provide a rolling bed. He politely argued that the double bed rooms available are on the very low levels. So it looks like he gave me better room in higher floors. It is true. The room is on the 14th and we can see union square from our window. Very nice. But the rolling bed did not come until 10:43pm when I have almost fallen asleep. The guy who sent the bed apologized for the delay.Maybe the fault is mine. I expected a 5-star hotel quality without knowing the truth that Grand Hyatt is not one. Maybe my expectation was too much because of the word ""Grand."" ",28-Dec-15,2
This was our first hotel in a 9 day trip down the PCH with our 2 college sons. It was by far our favorite hotel of our trip! This was our families first trip to San Francisco and the central location was perfect and the holiday spirit was magical. The rooms were superb and quiet and the bay view was spectacular. Make sure to go to top floor sky deck for awesome views.,28-Dec-15,5
"Very nice staff, location and amenities! Awesome view! Smoothest elevator! Loved taking pictures from top-floor with large windows! Upgrading to Club membership for just $50 paid off for my family of 4!",28-Dec-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is centrally located right by Union Square in SF downtown, so that is a plus for tourists. The downside of that of course is the horrible traffic if you have a car or want to catch a cab to get out of that area. The grand club lounge had decent food and decent service for a U.S. hotel...of course they don't compare to the service at hotels in Asia which we're used to... Being a traveling family, I wish they had an indoor pool but it seems all or most of the SF downtown hotels don't have one. ",27-Dec-15,3
"Nice location aside Union Square. Hyatt QualityYou can go walking to all big stores and malls, plenty of restuarants, but also to chinatown, littlel italy, AT&T Park, etc., or just take ubers to any touristic areas for some few bucksWe used a lot of zipcars since many walking distance parking lots on area, to go to close sites like sausalito, monterey or napa valleyGood choice to stay",27-Dec-15,4
"Great hotel right in the center of San Francisco on Union Square. Make it easy to reach restaurants, all kind of entertainment. The Regency Club is not the best, so plan that part. The views around San Francisco is great almost no matter what room you get.",27-Dec-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt is located right next to Union Square (2 minute walk). So yes, you cannot ask for a better spot in downtown SF. We traveled with our toddler and stayed there on Christmas eve and Christmas day. He was offered a choice of little gifts on a small wheelbarrow when we checked in and I found that to be especially thoughtful. Nothing like a well behaved toddler during check-in. We were upgraded on arrival with a 2pm late checkout option (perks of being a platinum member...so yes, do get on their GoldPassport program) and the view from the room was awesome (facing the ocean side of downtown). The rooms and bathrooms are pretty good in size, considering that you are in downtown SF. The king size bed was super comfy. I happened to have one of the best Moscow Mules ever at the ""One Up"" lounge on the mezzanine level, which by the way is a cozy little place to sit back and relax. They also serve some tasty bites. Overnight parking charges are a bit steep, but thats expected anywhere in SF. In summary, I would recommend the property for both business and family travel.",26-Dec-15,5
Very good hotel in a convenient location near Union Square. Location is very good access to many stores for shopping and places to eat or drink at night. Rooms are all new and modern with comfortable beds and very clean. I would definitely recommend staying here if visiting San Francisco.,26-Dec-15,5
"okay, first thing about this place that may sound negative, but you'll understand so Im getting out of the way right now. This is not a 'quiet' hotel, not only in the heart of union square, and all the car traffic you hear from below, but also the noise of elevators, plumbing (especially toilet flushes), this place is impossible to sleep in without earplugs....which the hotel provides! But understand that before you book here if getting a great night sleep is on your priority list, cause other than that this hotel is great! I highly recommend splurging and getting the club level rooms, the view is amazing (we got to look west and over union square, and for Christmas is was amazing!). Plus the added benefit of getting into the club room on floor 32 was an added (and unexpected) treat, we had breakfast, snacks, and evening cocktail, getting to look north over downtown and the bay, it was worth the price of admission just for that!!! We live in the bay area (just stayed night to go see nutcracker) and we were amazed at the beauty of it all, and the comfort of just sitting there with a nice glass of wine.As for the rooms, they are a bit on the small side, but the beds were super comfy, the bathroom very clean and spacious enough for a family of 3. One downside is their 'queen' bed is actually a full size bed, we laughed a little, but it was fine. We did have lunch at the Oneup restaurant, and the food was delicious, but don't expect 'large' portions, they are smaller portions (I think they call them bar bites) but was perfect enough for us, not to be over stuffed, and ready to go to the ballet!Ive stayed at a dozen or so hotels, from the biggies to boutique hotels, and I think this was my favorite (other than the noise, but the earplugs did help). I thought the location perfect, the staff from valets, to checkin/out were very professional, and the folks in the club room were very courteous!if want to spend a couple of days in the city, this is the place to stay!",25-Dec-15,5
"I always look to stay at the Grand Hyatt whether I'm visiting for business or pleasure as the location and convenience of parking and shopping are unsurpassable. If the price is right, this is always my first choice.",24-Dec-15,5
I've stayed here so many times it's my home away from home. I participate in trade shows at the Moscone Center and the Grand Hyatt is just a few blocks away. It's in a great location next to Union Sq. Great restaurants and shopping are right there. This hotel has all of the amenities you'd expect from a great hotel!,23-Dec-15,4
"Very nice bay view room, very clean and modern, very helpful staff, great location for holiday shopping, close to some very good restaurants, all at a very fair price considering it is in San Francisco at Union Square.",22-Dec-15,5
My friend and I had a most enjoyable stay at the Grand Hyatt. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever experienced in a hotel. The view was spectacular. The staff was very efficient and kind. I will stay at a Hyatt again.,21-Dec-15,5
Even with the pretty heavy construction around the hotel you can score a pretty quiet room (if you ask for it). I was lucky again and got it. There is a few things that could be a bit better but in all I highly recommend it. You CANNOT chose better location in the downtown SF.,21-Dec-15,4
"We arrived at 3:30 and our room wasn't ready yet. No others were available, so we were upgraded from Club to an executive suite. The view was pretty good and I loved the separate rooms so that my husband and I had one room and the kids had another (we got a roll away). Also nice was that there were two bathrooms- one with a tub and one with a shower. Also, we went out and when we came back in the evening, we had been brought free wine and cheese plate. What a nice touch! We loved it!!The club room on the 32nd floor was awesome (and worth the extra $) because we could have food/drinks whenever we wanted. With two kids who love to snack throughout the day, this came in handy. There was a lot to eat during the continental breakfast, as well as cookies and other snacks. Dinner time had appetizers.All in all, check in and check out was quick and the property was quiet and clean (and just a block from Union Square!)TIP: Don't pay the high valet rate- right around the corner is a public parking. We stayed sat-sunday 3:30pm-11am for $18!! Cheaper than anywhere else in the area!",20-Dec-15,5
"I was recently in San Francisco for business and my group arranged for me to stay at the Grand Hyatt! Lucky me! This place has wonderful service (from check in, to restaurants, to room service, to check out, to housekeeping, to door men. I could not have felt more attended to and special. The room was perfect (and I got a fantastic view of northern San Francisco and the bay). Very comfortable. Very sleek and clean. Very very nice. And, oh yes, the location is right at Union Square. Perfect.",18-Dec-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt is right on Union Square, centrally located for most San Francisco activities. The staff was absolutely excellent and the hotel was modern, comfortable and the restaurants were great! We visit San Francisco once or twice a year and this rates as one of the best hotels we've tried. Definitely worth repeating.",17-Dec-15,5
"I stayed here for one night for business. The room is beautiful, and the bathroom fixtures are really nice. I really appreciated the shades, which kept the room really dark. You can't beat the location, which is adjacent to Union Square. Please note that there is a major construction project happening right next to the hotel. I requested a quiet room and couldn't hear a thing.",16-Dec-15,4
"It is right across Union Square and very near shopping stores and convention center. However, there is still on going road construction when I was there. I find the lobby not so well lighted and the elevator seems old. You need to call housekeeping if you need amenities like slippers, shavers etc as they are not readily available in the room but they are free of charge. The breakfast area is great but there is not much variety in terms of the food (if you stay there for more than three days). The concierge was very helpful but their station is located at the other end of the lobby.",15-Dec-15,4
"We were lucky enough for the hotel to provide us with access to the Grand Club. The view is wonderful of some of the city's sights and the service is outstanding. The staff works tirelessly to ensure your table is clean and helpful with providing fresh eatery items. Also, they are very courteous and some of them would provide suggestions about sightseeing destinations.The front desk was very helpful with our reservations and the service overall was excellent.",15-Dec-15,4
"Wonderful City and Outstanding Hotel-- Grand Hyatt--highly recommend and we will return!! The location, accommodations and staff are excellent. We had a group of 12 couples staying and all complimented the hotel and staff.",15-Dec-15,5
"An outstanding hotel with a very attentive and can do attitude staff. Everyone from the bell staff, reservations, sales and maid were extremely friendly, helpful and made you feel important and comfortable. Rooms were very clean and high quality food. Great hospitality room with a beautiful view of San Francisco.",15-Dec-15,5
"This hotel is in a great location with plenty of things to do and see within a couple blocks of the hotel. The lobby is nice and spacious. The gym has a great view but is a little cramped. The rooms are fairly nice. The furniture and bathroom are a little dated but the real issue is that the door is not soundproofed. You can hear everything that is going on in the hallway. Anytime someone opens a door, talks in a moderate voice it sounds like it is happening right next to you. ",14-Dec-15,4
"I was treated like a queen from the moment I walked in the Grand Hyatt. The room was perfectly appointed, service was great, I will be back again. I decided to upgrade myself to the top floor and it was worth it. The grand level with the delicious food and drinks were well worth it.",11-Dec-15,5
"This hotel is in a very good location, located right near shopping, restaurants and the trolleys just a few blocks away! The service in all areas of the hotel were great! The concierge and front desk were extremely helpful and friendly, as were the bar servers. The only drawbacks of this hotel are three things: they are building the new subway/transit system literally right next to the hotel, so the noise level is very loud, especially in the early mornings! (Alas, the Hyatt does provide you with earplugs). And since they are building the new transit, the sidewalks and streets are all blocked and boarded up, not that big of a deal, but when your lugging luggage around, it can get annoying. Lastly, the elevators in the hotel are sooooooo slow, and annoyingly confusing. At one point we were boarding the staff elevator, which is unmarked and right next to the guest elevator, and on the bar level, you push the call button, which the elevator could open up on the other side, which you can't even see! (Suggestion, don't board the elevator from the restaurant/bar level)! Also, personally, I feel if you are younger, this may not be the hotel for you, as I was wanting a more youthful presence, this hotel seemed to cater to an older and/or more reserved clientele. The bar was very subdued and quiet, and was not even open for an early Sunday morning mimosa, which they also didn't serve in the restaurant (weird, right?!) however, one of the servers did make me one, which is why I said the service was great! I wouldn't stay here again, but the hotel is not bad by any means, it just was not the right hotel for me.",11-Dec-15,3
"Stayed here from end Nov for 6 nights as a family (2 adults 2 tweens/teens). We got a club room on the 30th floor, with access to breakfast and snacks at the Club lounge. Overall it was great value and great location, but with a few areas that were below my expectations of a Grand Hyatt experience.The good:- great location, right next to Union Square- service staff were excellent, from valet to front desk to housekeeping- nice breakfast at Club lounge with great view of the Bay- free Wifi in the room- humidifier was provided in the room. Nice touch as the air was very dry.- nice gym with many treadmills.The not so good:- room seemed dated, no shower stall and only a bath tub with shower head.- we had 2 double beds, the mattresses was soft and sort of sank in the middle so with 2 pax per bed we felt like we were sinking in sideways. But maybe if it's just one person on a bed it would not have been so obvious? The mattress was definitely the least comfortable of all the beds we slept in on this trip.- room was at the end of a corridor next to the staff room and a lot smaller than expected. I called and was told that all double rooms were the same size so I did not pursue it further. - our view was the top of other buildings, rather blah. Overall we had a good stay, despite the cramped conditions (which I suppose I cannot complain about as we had 4 pax in a room, but the room was certainly much smaller than other double rooms we stayed in). It was good value for money and great location, all things considered. Service staff were very good all around. I don't know if we had simply gotten a small room that had yet to be refurbished and had a lousy view, but I would certainly consider staying here again if we could get a bigger room or a more updated one next time round.",10-Dec-15,3
"Right bang in the center of the city and must be the very top hotel there. Nothing to fault - staff service, restaurants and good rooms. Cannot hear any noise so we are happy here. Good views all over the city from all high up rooms.",10-Dec-15,5
"Great place to stay and get into the holiday spirit. Stayed here with wife and two best friends. Very cheerful atmosphere. Pleasant staff, friendly guests. Clean upscale room with great City views.. Great location at Union square.",10-Dec-15,5
"I went for a conference. My room faced the city and was incredibly loud -- could hear the buses and trolleys squeaking down below all night long.Food provided at conference was fine. Actual room was quite comfortable with good amenities (including a white noise machine -- so they must know about the problem.) If I went back, I'd spend more for room on other side of the building.",9-Dec-15,3
"Great entry lobby and attention to customers as they enter. The room was very clean and new. View out the windows was noting special. The location was good centralized, could use more information to first timers in the city.",8-Dec-15,5
Very happy with the new and improved Grand Hyatt Union Square. Lovely rooms with floor to ceiling windows looking out over the city to the Bay. Great service and perfect downtown location. Will go back next time we are in San Francisco.,8-Dec-15,5
"I checked in for the second night for a 2-day convention at Moscone. Everything is as expected for a Grand Hyatt at the heart of San Francisco. Welcoming staff, modern interior, exterior was a bit outdated though. My room was on the 18th floor and I had a great view. There are also plenty of restaurants nearby. Moscone Center is a 10-minute walk away. I do have one gripe that took off one star. The room door was not soundproofed properly. I could hear people outside talking as if they are standing right outside of my door. When I heard them opening and closing their doors, it sounded like they were opening and closing my door. A little weird especially considering the bath tub is right there by the door. Not a huge problem, though, I only heard them 2 or 3 times. Just wish it would be a bit quieter. ",7-Dec-15,4
We stay at the Grand Hyatt every year at Christmas time. And always stay in a Union Square view room. This year it was on the 24th floor with a beautiful city view and the ice skaters in Union Square. Really puts you in the Christmas spirit. Room is nicely decorated with floor to ceiling windows. We always upgrade to the club lounge on the 32nd floor. Appetizers and alcoholic beverages (for a minimal charge) at 5:00. And a very nice breakfast with hot and cold selections,7-Dec-15,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco for business. The hotel is busy yet friendly. The staff is excellent and friendly. The bell hops are courteous, friendly, yet never made me feel like I had to give them a tip. The view of the sunrise from the gym on the 35th floor is spectacular. Location is excellent within walking distance to the BART, shopping, and Union Square. I felt safe walking around by myself.",7-Dec-15,4
"We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The hotel is perfected located for shopping and dining and entertainment. Staff is pleasant and extremely helpful when recommending dining and offering directions. The streets and buildings all around the hotel are undergoing massive renovation so vehicle and pedestrian traffic is not so easy to navigate. However, these are al good signs the economy is rebounding. Would recommend this hotel for sure!!",7-Dec-15,5
"Stayed at the San Francisco Grand Hyatt for 7 nights on business and co hosted an event in the meeting spaces. I got to interact with almost all of the departments. The most noticeable thread throughout the property was the staff. From the housekeeping, to front desk, the terrific concierge, and meeting/ food services staff; I was able to make the property my home and workplace with ease for a week. All of my guests were well attended to. The building and rooms are kept very well. The club was very nice and had a decent selection. Location is also good, walking distance to many attractions, shopping and restaurants incl Chinatown. The only critique I'd have are that some of the rooms could have been engineered a little better, as the space was a little squeezed. Understand this is a city hotel. Also, the walls next to me were thin and I had a group in the suite next door and I could hear their normal talking, which got pretty loud. Other than that, the hotel is a shining example why I pick Hyatt whenever possible!",6-Dec-15,5
"Right in the heart of Union Square, this hotel has all the night touches for a comfortable visit. The location is fantastic, in the heart of great shopping and dining. The rooms are very nice and if you're able to get a high floor, go for it. Many have views of the skyline and the water. Rooms are modern and comfortable. On-site dining is typical so I'd get out as much as possible. Just so many great options nearby. ",5-Dec-15,5
"We just returned from a stay at the San Francisco Grant Hyatt San Francisco. Steve assisted us at check-in ... he was fantastic. I prefer Hyatt Hotels for our stays, but unfortunately I cannot give the Grand Hyatt a 5 rating as I have for previous hotels. Don't get my wrong ... this is an excellent hotel. We had an Union Square view room, and quite frankly I think I would have preferred a view of the Bay. I find the ocean to be more peaceful. The view of the square is really nice, though. My reason for four stars is because I think the hotel needs some upgrading. Our room was nice, but seemed a bit cramped. The carpet looked like it was in need of replacement, and the light in the outside hallway shined into our room at night because the door did not seem to fit properly into the door jam leaving an approx. 1/2 gap at the bottom of the door, and a 1/4 inch gap around the door itself.Would I stay here again? Certainly ... this is a great hotel located in the center of Union Square. Parking in SF is expensive, so I would recommend the Sutter-Stockton Garage about 1/2 block from the hotel ... but remember, most garages do not offer in and out priv. so you will pay extra if you move your car.",5-Dec-15,4
"We liked this hotel so much we extended our stay there instead of moving on. The Grand Hyatt is conveniently located 2 blocks from Union Square and we were able to walk to many places like China Town, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf and the Ferry Building.We thought that everything about this hotel was top notch from the helpful staff, exercise room and the room itself. We were located on the 17th floor and I thought that we had a pretty good view of the city.The room was a modern decor and had the usual microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. The bathroom had a sink big enough to bath a kid in it. The room also had a number of nice unexpected touches such as power and USB outlets, directional reading lights and power shade controls on both sides of the bed. There were a few minor negatives. The windows were not soundproofed enough and we could hear sirens and construction from the street below. There were some complimentary earplugs available but we didn't use them. The bathroom has a sliding door which offers no sound privacy. Also, their tv-entertainment-info system was painful to use.We opted to park in the Sutter-Stockton garage located caddy-corner from the hotel. This was way cheaper than the Hotel's options. Even though we were there during the Blackf Fiday weekend, we had no problem finding a space for our overly large SUV.",5-Dec-15,5
"From check in to check out, the Grand Hyatt San Francisco is world class in comfort and guest related technology -- check in, check out , room service, Internet connection, etc. The location of the hotel in the center of one of the most beautiful cities of the world is great!",4-Dec-15,5
"Probably our favorite hotel during a two week trip in the US! The hotel is perfectly located 2 min from Union Sq (where all the shops are!) and the rooms are absolutely gorgeous! We had an amazing view from the 29th floor overlooking the city, we could watch the sunrise in the morning from the bed. We were lucky enough to have access to the Club Lounge, Ben was great and gave us some great tips on what to do in the city. Elaine at the Concierge was also great and remembered us every day we came to see her. As well a special thanks to Jane in Sales who took amazing care of us!",3-Dec-15,5
"Spent the Thanksgiving holiday visiting San Francisco with family. This location is absolutely perfect. We were near all of the public transit, and many of the ""tourist"" attractions we wanted to see. Walking distance to Chinatown, and a short cable car ride to Lombard Street, Ferry Building, and Fisherman's Wharf. I would definitely stay here again if I visit in the future. Being in the middle of downtown was also perfect for light shopping, excellent restaurants, and we were able to walk over to the lighting ceremony of the Macy's Christmas Tree. Couldn't be happier!",3-Dec-15,5
"Although this facility was a bit of a stretch for my budget, my party wanted to be near Union Square to take advantage of public transportation for our weekend. Everything about our stay was excellent and I can recommend this hotel highly.",3-Dec-15,5
"We just had three days at this Grand Hyatt. From the moment we stepped out of the car to be greeted by smiling,friendly Door men to when we left we cannot fault anything about this hotel Great location steps from Union Square , views from the room and a relaxing Bar for a well earned drink after the sights and shopping of this magnificent city. Will definitely choose the Grand Hyatt,Union Sq when next in San Fran",3-Dec-15,5
"After 3 requests to fix the ac...finally gave up getting anyone who had any idea of what they were doing...or in the last two cases would even respond. Loud people in the halls, and a staff hat couldn't care less. There are numerous better choices",2-Dec-15,2
Great Location - Great Staff - Great Place - Great Room - Great Price - Very Clean and well kept. Could not have been better. Walking distance to Union Square (45 seconds). Walking distance to Cable Cars (2-mins).,1-Dec-15,5
Love love love the Grand Hyatt on Union Square. Thank you for your hospitality. The fantastic food in The Grand Club Lounge especially the wait staff and food prepared -- very tasty. The housekeeping staff is very nice too. The gym is great. The gin gin candy from the concierge desk is good.,1-Dec-15,5
"Everything in the Grand Hyatt San Diego is just better than the one in San Diego. My toddlers and family loved our larger suite in San Diego but less the smaller cold and noisier suite in San Francisco. Everything here is designed for singles/adults but certainly not for families with kids. Suite a great until you have one or two kids with you. Hardwood floor sounds great until you kids keep sliding on it. Space is counted if you need to cram a roll-away and crib even within a suite. Noise level even on the 26th floor is not acceptable because the elevator makes you fell like there is a subway running under the hotel and your room is on the second floor. Service is slow to clean up the room and if heater is broken when cold weather hit SF, they you have seen it all. Please consider this review as an apple to apple comparison between SD and SF Grand Hyatt. Grand Hyatt is still a better proposition than most other hotel chains out there. But just like all others Grand Hyatt SF with nicer touches to families like us (baby bathtub, diapers trash and other baby gears installed in the room) is failing parents with toddlers and kids in a big way. Room layout is not for families nor are the amenities or services. I have yet to find an hotel who has thought about parents and how everybody in the family can enjoy hotel stay. Now I live in SJC so SF is just 45 min away for a nicer family weekend break. Not SD but I get smaller room. You win some, you lose some.",1-Dec-15,3
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt during the Thanksgiving weekend. The hotel is in the center of great shopping, restaurants so we never had to get in a car. Staff were welcoming and attentive. The breakfast on the concierge floor offered something for everyone. Definitely will stay here again. Recommend higher floors for the views.",30-Nov-15,5
"Noisy rooms, I could here people next door. Cold showers, hot water would run out. Cold room because heater did not work. Did not received view that I requested. Elevators are very slow. Staff was friendly but service was slow. The location is excellent and rooms were clean. But I still don't recommend.",30-Nov-15,3
"It's near all the shopping in Union Square, close to Chinatown, easy to walk to SOMA or Market St and access public transportation, and the rooms are spacious and modern. Wifi worked fine and you could order room service through some kind of web-style UI on the TV monitor. And I didn't have to foot the bill - I was there for a business trip - so it was highly affordable too. :-) Very convenient and I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone.",29-Nov-15,5
We enjoyed our stay at Grand Hyatt at Union Square. The hotel had beautiful rooms. We were on the 23rd floor with a beautiful view of the city/water view. The staff were so helpful and great about making our stay comfortable. The restaurant OneUp had delicious food. We ate a breakfast meal and dinner meal there. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,29-Nov-15,5
"Value for the per night rate. Located well within the city centre. Would definitely recommend an update to the bathrooms; the Hyatt branded hotels in Asia are much more elegant and well furnished. This should be standardise across the globe. What I have viewed in SF is a little disappointing but definitely much better that other chains that I have stayed at. However, I would suggest increasing the competence of the staff. At my checkout, most hotels in Asia will be able to process very quickly all the charges and be presented with the bill almost instantaneously. At Grand Hyatt SF, I had to wait at the counter with the service staff for nearly 15 minutes for him to clarify the charges. I'm confused. Am I the customer or should the hotel have such information at their finger tips? Where is the system/process to ensure that all charges are documented appropriately? So much explanation but not decisive, not clear and not customer friendly. I do not need to be troubled with the challenges you are experiencing; we want solutions and be out as soon as possible. Similarly, the night before my checkout, I had asked if a package was delivered and the bellboy was unable to locate the package when a message was left in my room phone to collect from the first level. Again, the team explained that they did not relay that message and that there was no package. I had to wait 30 minutes to clarify this.",29-Nov-15,4
"This hotel is so lovely and incredibly well situated. The staff is great. We had a great time, and will return to the hotel again. I would recommend this place to everyone as it is so close to everything. The rooms had wonderful views.",29-Nov-15,5
"If you plan to shop in San Francisco, this is the place to stay. It is within walking distance to every shop imaginable. There is some construction nearby, but you will not be too inconvenienced. The rooms are a good size. We had our son with us and a rollaway fit nicely in the room. The rooms were clean. The hallways could have been cleaner. There was a coffee spill near the elevators that stayed for two days without cleanup. There also seemed to be dishes, cutlery, glasses set outside the rooms that took forever to be cleaned up. The bathroom was a good size with one sink and a standup shower. There is a makeup table with chair outside of the bathroom. The room was pretty quiet, but the hallways were noisy. Sometimes I could hear through the door people talking. We were far away from the elevator, but the voices would carry. The staff was friendly. I will stay here again. It is better than most of the other hotels around Union Square.",28-Nov-15,4
"Surprisingly didn't offer 24 hour room service for a 4-5 star hotel. Was jet lagged and wanted a bite to eat after midnight, but told no room service after midnight. There wasn't any bottled water in the room. Service was lousy.",27-Nov-15,2
"My family and I stayed in this hotel for the first time. It looks newly renovated and the room looks new too. The hotel services is very good, especially the concierge services. They recommended some good restaurants near the hotel and they serve with a smile. The beds and pillows are very comfortable too. I will definitely stay in this hotel again if I have a chance to go to SF again.",25-Nov-15,5
We had a great time celebrating my granddaughter's 11th birthday. We were very impressed with how the hotel staff picked up on the fact it was her birthday without us making a point of telling them (must have been the helium balloon on our luggage cart. HA). The room was squeaky clean and we really liked the blackout shade. We will definitely be back,23-Nov-15,5
"Located on the corner of Sutter and Stockton the GH is one of the big Union Square hotels, as such it doesn't come cheap, but you are paying for Location and a modern very clean hotel.Perfectly placed for Union Square and downtown generally, with very helpful front desk and concierge staff you are well looked after straight from arrival. (sadly I didn't get her name but the women - from the Philippines- who checked me in was fabulous really friendly and helpful).Rooms are excellent, fresh roomy and a very comfortable bed, plenty of closet space and a good quality bathroom. shower could be more powerful but thats a small complaint.Breakfast high quality if a little pricey.Right now there is huge construction work going on in Union Sq, new Subway. I had a room over looking the square which had great views but even on the 21st floor you could hear construction work - it starts at 0630 even on weekends!! so whilst the view is great I suggest you ask for a room away from the square whilst the construction continues.",23-Nov-15,4
"We were lucky enough to stay at this modern hotel right in the middle of the city. We had a wonderful view and the hotel was great for taking public transit or walking to most of the major sights. As told by other reviewers ,and by the hotel itself, parking down the street is less expensive than the valet. If it's in your budget, I definitely recommend this city hotel!",22-Nov-15,4
Its not easy reviewing big hotels particularly when you don't have high expectations. I just want to sleep and I want to be able to watch TV when I wake up (at least when I'm in the US). Tick. Is that 200 characters yet?Rooms are a decent size and are quiet - I couldn't hear my neighbours nor anything from the street and I was on a fairly low floor (Moresby Inc not well recognised in the US yet I suspect). Bed was comfortable. The downstairs space is modern and restaurant looks cool (although we didn't try it). Checking in and out was easy. Must be more than 200 characters now.,21-Nov-15,5
At this particular hotel you will be told you don't have a reservation. You will be questioned about whether you know at which Hyatt you have actually made a reservation. When you ask to speak to a manager your request will be ignored. I strongly recommend you don't arrive to this hotel without a printed copy of your hotel reservation confirmation email.,21-Nov-15,1
Excellent location just off union square and walking distance to most tourist sites. Typical City centre hotel with a mixture of tourists and business people. The rooms were quiet and comfortable rather than luxurious but absolutely fine . Breakfast was good but you did sometimes need to wait for a table as the restaurant was small for hotel of this size. We stayed there with teenage children and they could provide interconnecting rooms which was big plus.,20-Nov-15,4
"Slightly more expensive than the Westin but definitely worth it given efficient hotel configuration, nicer rooms and strong service. Decor was modern but tasteful. Hotel generally quiet considering it's off of Union Square (versus its other competitors).",19-Nov-15,5
"Terrific location with a Hip Youthful Vibe at Union Square in S.F., modern rooms and super service. Seek out the ""Foodies"" in Concierge services for dining recommendations. This hotel is a great spot for solo female travelers on business, food lovers, true shoppers or for a fun weekend away.",18-Nov-15,4
"I booked this hotel because I was attending a conference there. What a mistake! This facility feels outdated and creaks when the wind blows. There is no front desk, only kiosks run by inexperienced staff. The restaurant food was terrible, even for a hotel. The room price I was quoted over the phone was not what I was charged. My room was $500 with taxes! I was told they charge higher rates on Sunday. What? Ridiculous. There are so many great hotels (and restaurants) in San Francisco. You can do better!",18-Nov-15,1
"I've stayed at the Hyatt a number of times on business due to its convenient location. The rooms have come to their years, the lobby is very flash and nice. Quite dark though. Like most places in US, there is an extra price tag for everything - literally. Its very pricey but the location is good. The staff however i don't remember as either warm nor overly friendly. I will stay there again, simply because its convenient for business, but wouldnt recommend for a private trip.",18-Nov-15,3
"I had a King Room with Concierge Access and a SPECTACULAR view of San Francisco! All staff were helpful and Professional and I was happy to meet all hotel Concierge during my stay for CRELC Event. This hotel is close to everything and a short cab to Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory, etc. ",17-Nov-15,5
"Stayed for 2 nights. Great location. Rooms just ok. Very weird bathroom sink (more like a trough) that took up too much of the countertop. Beds were fine. Room clean. SErvice great.Had apps and cocktails at the bar, great value, and nice way to relax after a 7h flight from the east coast.View from 36th floor unbeatable!!!Shopping nearby (bring your credit cards, every high end store on earth right around the block).",17-Nov-15,4
"My mother decided to surprise my father for his 70th birthday with a trip to San Francisco and we decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt. My mother, father and sister were coming from Alaska; I was coming from Pennsylvania. When making the reservations, I indicated that I would need a crib in the room (my sister was staying in the room with her three month old son). A few days before my arrival I received an email from the hotel asking about the child that would be staying in the room with me. I emailed back and indicated that my sister's three month old son would be in the room. Upon my arrival, I was blown away with the care that was taken preparing the room for the baby's arrival. The staff had already set up a pack and play, small baby blanket (blue with trucks, I believe), a small rubber ducky, a diaper pail, a travel size pack of baby soap/shampoo, a bottle brush/dish soap, and even a baby tub! I was so blown away that I had tears in my eyes. I have NEVER been anywhere that takes so much time making even their tiniest guests feel welcome. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left I felt like family. We were made to feel as if we were the only guests in the hotel; everyone was so kind and helpful! The staff makes sure to make everyone feel like they are the number one priority. I have stayed in many hotels, but I have never had an experience like this. I will absolutely stay here again if/when I'm in San Francisco. My father is a hard person to please, and he was even impressed with the hotel, staff and service!",17-Nov-15,5
The very best hotel in the Union Square area. The location cannot be any better. The staff is amazing. The views are spectacular. What makes this hotel so special is the staff. For business or pleasure the hotel is a haven to come back to after a busy day in the city.,17-Nov-15,5
"I was in 28th floor with a nice view of the Bay and Union Square - there was a construction right next to the hotel, and no noise was reaching my room. Service was great, every employee was very polite and helpful. Everything worked in my room and they had a complimentary set of elements that you could request: from make up remover to slippers. My only critisicm is that they don't have room service for lunch time (only morning and evening) and that they charge you $5 for every package you receive, no matter if you retrieve it the same day it arrived",17-Nov-15,4
"Stayed for 4 nights in October while visiting family who were also visiting San Francisco and staying here.Were given a corner room adjoining/connecting with their room, but whereas ours had a double queen bed they had a king bed. Found the room having double bed more spacious with a small alcove containing a table where you could do your make up etc. Very convenient.The amenities were ok, especially the body lotion (which they appeared to have run out of, as it was not replenished on daily basis). Other than that, very thoughtfully, they had placed a card mentioning that you just had to phone the housekeeping department in case you wanted the slippers or bath robes or the comb/shaving stuff etc. Our only regret that we found this note on the last day that we were there.Location is excellent with the facility of a shuttle to the airport very convenient. In the neighborhood, you can find some Starbucks coffee shops and of course the Indian flagship hotel Taj is right opposite.Breakfast buffet was fairly extensive but with hardly any variety on day to day basis. The provision of fresh fruit was welcome, which we indulged in to our heart's content. Eggs could be ordered made to order and were catered to as per requirement. Other than that there was the usual sausages, potatoes, cereals and the like.Quite liked the lobby, where a nice warm fire raged behind the glass enclosure making it a nice warm place to sit and browse from the selection of books, so thoughtfully provided. One negative point was that the front office staff could have been more efficient. At times there was just one person standing with a longish queue forming up. Second negative point was that despite our request we were not given a higher floor and had to be content with rooms on 7th. floor. So, I cannot say that there was a great view.",16-Nov-15,4
"Either the property is very tired or they gave me a very tired room since I was using points. Room 3010: smells of sewer gas, toilet made strange loud sound when flushing, the nightstand drawers and the other cabinets were in poor shape. On the plus side the club was okay except kept extremely cold so people would not hang out too long. Staff in club was excellent. Elevators were dirty. Valet parking is $67 and change per night.My original keys were not able to get into club even though I brought the fact they needed to be up when checking in.I have been a Hyatt member since mid 80s.I think I am done now.",16-Nov-15,3
"We arrived for a week after a 17 hour journey, a friendly staff unloaded our bags whilst we registered, our request for a high floor and Bay view, booked 18 months prior was ignored. Instead we were mid floor City view. Our bags taken to our room and the porter gave us several tips about what to and not do. The room was very clean with 2 Queen Beds and the bathroom included all the usual toiletries. The use of Bathrobes and slippers was welcome. The view overlooking Union Square and facing Macy's was pretty good. From a central location it was simple to get to the cable cars and car hire, with lots of shops, restaurants and tourist attractions within walking distance. We requested a mini fridge, it was delivered within 5 minutes. So our overall impression of the hotel was good.",15-Nov-15,4
"Grand Hyatt is well-located. Good customer service. Rooms are clean. Loved the electronic blinds! Check-in was quick as was check-out. Staff was friendly and when I needed some additional amenities, they were brought to my room within 5 minutes.",14-Nov-15,4
"Excellent location, comfortable and clean, friendly staff, ideal for shopping, sightseeing and business meeting. In close proximity to Chinatown and the historic tram. Wonderful views of the San Francisco Bay from the 36th floor.",13-Nov-15,4
"Arrived exhausted mid-week in the middle of a multi-location business trip. Check in was super easy and fast and I was directed to my room on the 27th floor. Gorgeous room and amazing view over the city and the bay. I was too tired to do much than drop off my belongings and head downstairs to the onsite restaurant, OneUp. The service was great as way my Cioppino followed by Caramelized apple pie (dessert for me is a rare indulgence). I didn't do much more than fall into bed, leaving the unpacking until the following morning. That is when I observed the unique elements that make this room/hotel so perfect for me. I have been doing a lot of travel lately and never, I mean not once, have I been blessed with a 'do-your-hair/makeup counter' as this room has. I don't like standing in the bathroom to dry my hair or peer into the over the sink mirror to get my makeup on. At home I use a lighted magnified mirror which helps me get things right! I usually remember to pack my portable magnified mirror which I will often balance precariously on a surface close enough to natural light and also an outlet for the hair dryer/hot iron. I practically screamed with delight when I came across the large, magnified, illuminated mirror sitting quietly and with stability on this little alcove equipped with outlets, a counter for my junk and a stool to sit on!! Happiness times a million! Thank you Grand Hyatt. If all your hotels are equipped similarly you will be my go-to chain in future.Oh, and did I mention the comfy bed, amazing view and general comfort (no noise) and general excellence of this hotel for a weary female traveler? Love, love, love.",12-Nov-15,5
"I stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 34th floor and could not have been happier. The suite was very large with a private bedroom and bathroom, a living room with 2 sofas, a desk with a Mac and printer, dinning room table with seating for 6, a wine refrigerator, another small refrigerator, small prep area, a well stocked Keurig and another half bath. Every room had sweeping views of the city and bay.The hotel itself was very nice with a good restaurant and great spaces to with sofas and fireplaces for people to gather. In walking distance to shops and restaurants. I would highly recommend this hotel.",12-Nov-15,5
"Overall our four night stay was delightful. We requested a quiet room -- there is a lot of construction work happening nearby (new Apple Store being built and a large portion of Stockton St is being dug up) -- so the lower floors can be noisy. On the 21st floor it was relatively quiet, and we had a great view over Union Square. The staff were friendly and helpful with requests. The hotel is a 10-15 minute walk to the convention Center, and close to trolley cars (fun and cheap transport). Only negative, is that the restaurant lacked atmosphere and was overpriced for casual dining.",12-Nov-15,4
My stay was for a convention I worked. So I came very tired and I found my room to be relaxing and clean. I was able to get a great night sleep every night. The check was easy and the staff was very nice and professional. The hotel is very quiet.,12-Nov-15,5
"Hyatt Grand San Francisco offers allmost everything you expect from high end hotel. The rooms are spacious, clean and welcoming. The bathroom too is spatious too but I havenâ€™t spotted the largely expected bathrobe and branded slippers. One good thing is that the rooms are well noise insulated adding bonuses on sleep quality. Best view is in the rooms overseeing the Union Sq. but the view it comes at a price as construction works currently taking place there may be bothersome during early hours.Having said that, a bit of urgency at the reception may do no harm",11-Nov-15,4
"I have stayed at Hyatt's all over the world including this one, many times.Usually I have a great experience and the staff are well trained, the systems work.Maybe I caught them on a bad couple of days.The problem started when I tried to order room service and the auto-answering service told me room service was closed at just after 9 pm. which I knew wasn't possible.So I called the front desk. They seemed unconcerned but they did connect me to room service which was prompt and good quality.Next morning, I went through the regular drill of lining up at the main restaurant which as usual at 8 a.m. was full. But after waiting 10 minutes without any communication, I went straight to the back restaurant which I knew from previous visits is where they would send me.There they told me to go back to the line and wait. I said if I leave the restaurantwill go to the Taj hotel across the street rather than be ignored again.They then immediately seated me and we had a perfectly pleasant breakfast and Jason, our server was delightful. This morning I went back to the regular place as my colleague already had a table. It was fine but not particularly welcoming other than the server who was very friendly.I think the real problem is one of service and communication. Everyone can wait if asked politely, but to be ignored is not what I have come to expect from the Grand Hyatts anywhere.For the rest of my stay, 3 nights, everything was fine except for the restaurant ambience.",11-Nov-15,3
"We stayed in the Grand Hyatt just off Union Square. The hotel was lovely, and our room was luxurious. The room service was excessively pricey (my $19 Cobb salad and glass of water cost about $35 once all the fees, taxes, etc were added), but the location was perfect. And there were 3 Starbucks on the same block. There were many other nice restaurants and great shopping within a short walk too. The trolley ride to the Wharf was fun and scenic. If you walk a few blocks from the hotel you will encounter homeless people (and once right in front of the hotel a very unstable woman needed to be taken away by police and ambulance). This is a reality of bigger cities and was not a problem for us, but I suppose some people would like to be aware of this. It would be the same for any hotel in the area. I wasn't impressed with the restaurant we went to in the hotel, but really enjoyed several close by.",11-Nov-15,4
"All of the staff at this hotel are great but front desk staff really go above and beyond to make your experience great. Nice hotel, perfect location and nice views. Would stay here again. The breakfast buffet was average so we ordered off menu. ",11-Nov-15,4
"Rooms are nicely decorated but need more thorough maintenance, in particular the ventilation trap door that was blackened by dirt. Very limited in room dining menu. Food quality isaverage. Very noisy ventilation system. Good staff. No spa facilities , no swimming pool",11-Nov-15,3
"Perfect location, central, close to union square, the market place, financial district, and china town; we walked and never needed to drive. Hotel rooms could use more outlets for charging cell phones, lap tops, etc. in the bedrooms, but overall, the rooms were clean , modern and nice.",10-Nov-15,5
I stayed in the City for three days on business the Grand Hyatt has everything. Location attentive staff reasonable rates and great amenities. I always stay there for my CME courses. Love San Francisco,10-Nov-15,5
"This is always one of my favorite hotels to stay at, with a starbucks right across the street, Nike on the corner and China town for walking makes the area fun place to visit. The hotel is simple in check in and out, and always a comfortable stay.",9-Nov-15,5
"Excellent choice for stay in SF!!! Rooms quiet clean and comfortable, Staff all friendly and helpful, BEAUTIFUL views from our room and workout room. Perfect location. Would gladly choose this hotel again next time I travel to SF",9-Nov-15,5
"It is hard to find good accommodation in good areas of San Francisco at a reasonable price. This was an expensive three-night stay in one room with two adults and two teenagers, but worth it, if for nothing else than the location of this hotel in Union Square.Check In â€“ small queue at check in and whole process was very thorough staff spending as much time as needed with each customer. Very happy and informed staff who gave great information of attractions, events and restaurants around the area.Room â€“ was small but had everything we needed. We were on and upper floor so views of the bay were magical out the floor to ceiling windows. Modern room with all mod cons. Very comfortable beds and good shower. Free in room Wi-Fi.Location â€“ Union Square location was great for us, it was easy walking distance to Westfield Centre, Apple Store, Macyâ€™s, China Town and heaps of restaurants. If staying in San Francisco again would be staying at Union SquareCheck Out â€“ simple and efficient didnâ€™t need to return the key, bill was delivered the night before, all paid and then just left the room cards in the room and left. Car was in parking and arrived by the time we arrived in the lobby with our bags.",7-Nov-15,4
"I've been to a few Hyatt in Australia and Asia and this one is well below that standard. The location is great, just off union square and the staff are good but when you pay almost $400 a night, I expect better quality. The shower was in a bathtub and the buffet breakfast was small and weak.The bed was very comfortable and there was a selection of different types of pillows to suit all tastes - which is a huge plus for me.This is a good hotel - just not good value.",7-Nov-15,3
"Location is good for shopping but beware of the massive amount of homeless and otherwise avoidable. Ask for a north facing room, worth the effort. Central location and easy to get uber/lyft/etc. Avoid the square, disgusting.",6-Nov-15,4
"This was mine and my husband's third time staying at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. We love the location, the atmosphere, the style, and the staff. Although the one thing we've noticed that is a reoccurring issue for us is the noise level. In our recent stay we purposely requested our room to be up on a higher level due to the noise level. The helpful receptionist helped me on my request and put our room on the 32nd floor, which didn't really help at all with the noise level. Everything was wonderful with our room until we went to bed and was woken up to sirens, people yelling, car noises etc..There was really nothing anyone could do so we just tried to sleep through the night. When we checked out the front desk had asked us how our room was and we explained how everything was wonderful with the room except the noise level. Their response to us was that we shouldn't have been bothered with the noise and they just seem to not care about how we felt. We just brushed off their response because other than the noise we had a great time, grand hyatt just needs to replace their thin windows.",6-Nov-15,4
"We left a really nice hotel over at fisherman's wharf to come over to the Grand Hyatt for a work event. I had been told by the first hotel that the Grand Hyatt was a nice, classy hotel. Perhaps in the 70s that was true, unfortunately the room decor appears to have not changed since then. Wood paneling, wood panelling everywhere! Even the phones and lamps look really dated, which is not something I would normally notice at all. I half expected to find an old top-loading VCR hooked up to the TV. The lobby area was nice, but then who spends much time in the lobby other than the staff?There was no offer to take our bags up to our room (not that we necessarily needed it, but EVERY other hotel I've stayed at in the USA has at least offered). For some reason the bathroom door doesn't shut flush against the wall, which means you have no real privacy. Fortunately I was with my wife but if 2 colleagues were sharing a twin room it would be embarrassing.The only plus point I can really give the hotel is that it's in a good location, but there are other hotels nearby which I'll try out instead next time.",5-Nov-15,2
"We stayed at this hotel for my husband's business conference, so it was chosen for us. And I must say, it was a wonderful choice! I loved our stay, didn't want to leave. The hotel is updated and modern, clean and beautiful. Very friendly staff! I loved being able to walk everywhere, especially close to shopping.There was a lot of construction going on in Union Square, but the hotel was very quiet, so we were not bothered at all by it at all.Thanks for a great stay, we will be back!",5-Nov-15,5
This is a beautifully hotel in a great location. Our room was gorgeous with a great city view and it had all the latest amenities. I especially liked all the extra outlets for charging devices. The thing that especially stood out to me was how well trained and helpful all the staff are. We were greeted warmly and throughout the entire stay everyone was so pleasant and helpful. I was especially impressed with a gentleman who appeared to be cleaning rooms who noticed that the water cooler on my floor was empty and I was looking for water. He offered to get bottles of water for me right away. I haven't seen such service in other hotels in a long time.,5-Nov-15,5
The Grand Hyatt is centrally located in Union Square. The rooms and the service were excellent and everything was in working order. Loved the idea of refilling water bottles from 20 gal bottles. It worked very well. Close to food and locatwed in a great walking area.,5-Nov-15,4
"As a diamond member of the Hyatt Gold passport program, I found this Grand Hyatt in San Francisco to be one of the best.The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. The staff was extremely professional and courteous. The Grand Hyatt San Francisco will be my first choice when ever I visit the city.",4-Nov-15,5
"Girls night for a birthday! Had the city view with king bed. Lovely view, not to bad for noise considering it was over Stockton St. Staff was extremily friendly. Location is perfect, right on Union Square for a great shopping experience. 2 blocks south of China town, 2 block north of bart.",4-Nov-15,5
"For the price they charge, the bathroom smelled sour like it had been cleaned by a dirty rag, the water pressure dribbled out of the shower, the TV was so small you could barely see it, and our AC was broken in the room. As a Gold Passport member, we were also placed in a room facing other buildings with no view. Avoid this Hyatt, as there is nothing ""Grand"" about it.",3-Nov-15,2
Once again the Grand Hyatt has provided us with the best place to stay in the Union Square area. The staff was spectacular and the Club Level made our stay just perfect. Won't stay anyplace else when in San Francisco.,3-Nov-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco afforded all one could want when visiting the city: a fantastic location, superb service, and the benefits of Hyatt's Gold Passport program. As a ""road warrior"" I have the opportunity to experience dozens of hotels in the course of a year, the Grand Hyatt San Francisco met all of my expectations--and I'm not easy to please!",3-Nov-15,5
"Hotel is accessible to Union Square for shopping. Hotel is within walking distance to all local Restaurants. Renovation is on going next to the Hotel, but does not affect a persons stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel off of Stockton Ave. Bedding is good and the view of the city is spectacular.",3-Nov-15,5
"Noisy Employee talking loudly on the phone for 20 minutes after midnight woke us up. We couldn't go back to sleep afterwards. The pillows were too flat, our neck hurt in the morning and bothered us for 2 days.",3-Nov-15,3
"We had a beautiful room. Fantastic fitness center. Our booking gave us access to the Club facility. We ate breakfast there every day. There were a couple hot items, and anything else you could possibly need for breakfast. Evening hors d'oeuvres had a feature dish that was always delicious. And there were mini desserts later. The only thing we had to pay for were bar drinks. There were various luxuries in the room as well. The staff were also very courteous and attentive. I can't think of any negatives.",2-Nov-15,5
I had a very pleasant stay at the Hyatt. I was in town overnight on business and the location was perfect. The staff was great. Check in was smooth and quick. the facility was modern and fresh. The room was clean and the TV had a welcome message when I walked into the room. I would recommend this property.,30-Oct-15,5
"Standard and what you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Superb location in Union Square, excellent service, bar and restaurant, breakfast options, fitness center with a great view, a tasteful bathroom.But the room was covered in dust, which is just unacceptable at this level of hotel.There was also an issue getting some sports channels on the television.",29-Oct-15,4
"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times for both business and pleasure, and every time it has been amazing. The rooms are modern, the service is impeccable, and you can't beat the location. We were upgraded to Grand Club and it's definitely worth it for the daily breakfast and happy hour. The hotel is just a few blocks from BART, close to cable cars, shopping and of course all of the fabulous restaurants in San Francisco.",29-Oct-15,5
"We really appreciated the excellent customer service and the cleanliness. Road construction made walking around the square a little challenging, but it was still do-able and we felt safe. Easy access to Muni was helpful.",28-Oct-15,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in the beginning of October to celebrate my 30th birthday and can honestly say that I have never been treated sooooo poorly as a guest. Having experience working at the Montage Laguna Beach and Palomar Hotel San Diego, and having stayed at multiple different properties including Hyatts, Marriotts, and a number of boutique hotels throughout my years of traveling, I could promise you that your money would best be spent elsewhere. The hotel seems nice but could use more detail in cleanliness and function (elevators are slow and we had issues with the blackout curtain in our room). My biggest issue was with the staff. The last day of my stay I had a Tiffany's necklace, which was a birthday gift, stolen from my room. I spent hours going back and forth, contacting the front desk, housekeeping, and security. They sent security up to my room to file an incident report and I was told that someone would get back to me but never did. I feel as though the hotel staff was hoping that I would simply forget about the incident, considering I was the one continually following up with them. I spent the next 3 weeks going back and forth, calling and emailing the hotel and nothing was ever resolved. I was promised multiple times, verbally and through email correspondence, that the hotel would send a check to refund the cost of the necklace and then was just recently informed that the hotel had reconsidered the reimbursement. There are multiple hotels surrounding Union Square and I would strongly suggest staying at any other hotel. The Sir Francis Drake, for instance, was a wonderful property I've stayed at with friendly staff, beautiful decor, and stuff doesn't get stolen from your room there. If you do, however, choose to stay at the Grand Hyatt, I would recommend locking up any valuables and pray that you do not have to deal with the unfriendly and incompetent staff. ",27-Oct-15,1
"Great customer service, convenient location to transportation, shopping, and all the rest! Beautifully renovated, modern, yet classy. I look forward to staying here again on my next visit. Great value for the money!",26-Oct-15,5
"We stayed here for 2 nights before getting on a cruise ship. The location is very good, walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars and shops, and the cable car stop is also quite close. The room is comfortable with everything you need, a comfy bed and good amenities in the bathroom. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful.I think I would recommend this hotel for a short stay.",25-Oct-15,4
"Stayed there in 2012, most of the staff gave me a very cool impression. Stayed recently for 3 nights, staff were very warm and proactively to offer to help. View overlooking the bay area is fantastic. Internet speed is good.",22-Oct-15,4
"Arrived atthehotel about 2130 first impression was reception was very sparse ,but the service and check in we're faultless they gave a quick run down whilst checking in regarding facilities available, Then told had a lovely room on the 30th floor they weren't joking on entering the room straight away you could tell it was spotlessly clean bright and airy with modern funiature after a good nights sleep in a very comfortable bed I decided to open the blinds on doing so was greet with a fabulous view overlooking the city towards the bay and Alcatraz prison. The hotel staff who I dealing were very helpful and attentive to detail, the bar had good selection drink with an happy the head barman was very informative and friendly who made feel extremely welcome a credit to the hotel .If I ever return to San Francisco then this hotel would be top of my list to stay at .",21-Oct-15,5
SFO Grand Hyatt situated in a convenient location and is easy to reach out to different tourism spots. Staffs are nice and overall I would rate it above standard. I drove around SFO and there is a public car park nearby which could provide convenient and affordable pricing for overnight parking.,21-Oct-15,4
"We had a great stay here. The central location made it easy to walk to most places, or to jump on public transport.We stayed in one of the club level rooms, which was well worth it in our opinion. whilst the room was not the biggest (to be expected in city centre hotels) the views were great, and the room stylish and well appointed.Travelling with a 10 month old baby is never easy, but the staff bent over backwards to help up, providing not only a cot for the little one to sleep in, but also a pack of essential baby supplies - lotions, bottle cleaning brushes etc that was unasked for, but very much appreciated.The club level is great, as the lounge offers the that bit more space to relax in, plus lots of drinks and snacks on demand. The breakfast was great every morning, and the evening snacks were also good. It was a little frustrating that the club lounge closed every evening at 9pm (just about the time we'd got the baby to sleep and were ready to enjoy a drink!).A lovely hotel, with fabulous, friendly and efficient staff. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to recommend it to friends or to stay here again if I'm lucky enough to go back to San Francisco in the future.",21-Oct-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt at Union Square is truly a fantastic hotel. The beds were so comfortable that within minutes I was asleep! My friends and I chose this hotel (despite the steep price tag that night) because of its reputation, and because it was super close to the starting line for the Nike Women's Half Marathon, which was the primary purpose for the weekend. Service was en pointe from the moment I made the reservation: email reminders were sent out to me and pre-accommodations were offered. Upon check-in, we were greeted by Steven, who was genuinely concerned with our comfort for the night before the race. He placed us on the quieter side of the hotel, where we heard little to no sounds from the streets of Union Square overnight. It was truly amazing and almost worth the price paid. A couple of friends forgot some toiletries, and we had asked for additional pillows and towels, all of which came up to the room within minutes of the request despite the fact that the hotel was practically fully booked. Most other hotels leave you waiting around for hours, wondering if you need to call the front desk again as a reminder. Not the Grand Hyatt. Everything about the weekend was lovely - much gratitude and many many kudos to your staff!",21-Oct-15,4
"What a great staff only, matched by the elegance and functionality of the rooms. Easy to drive to the front door and then a truly enjoyable experience began. I recognized right away that the staff was something special; they were never engaged in personal conversations between each other, and they always greeted you with a genuine smile.",21-Oct-15,5
"I stayed here on business for 4 nights. The room was very good. Great coffee machine. There was some building work going close by, which combined with jet lag made for some sleepless nights but that didn't detract from a very pleasant all round stay. I would recommend the hotel as it is perfectly located. Credit has to go to the concierges. They were brilliant.",20-Oct-15,5
"Right on Union Square. When the street construction on the entrance of the Hotel is finished, the hotel will be much more lovely. The breakfast offered in this hotel has no match for those offered at Hyatt in the Asia. Don't worry, there are plenty of restuarants with various types of foods (including Thai noodle restuarant) surrounding the hotel. It is within blocks from all fine shops as well.Have no complain with services. We enjoy our three nights there very much.",19-Oct-15,4
"The Grand Hyatt was a perfect hotel for me and my family that was visiting from France. The location was fantastic- we were in close proximity to shopping & restaurants, and it was also a manageable walk to the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf. The staff was very attentive and willing to help with whatever was needed. Most importantly, the rooms were very clean!",19-Oct-15,5
"What a great city! What a great hotel! My husband & I just spent three nights at the Grand Hyatt and loved it... great location at Union Square and convenient to everything. Hyatt staff was great, especially Ahn in the Club Room -- she went above and beyond by offering to make my husband tea w/honey and lemon as he had a sore throat! So nice, as was everyone else there. Definitely recommend!",18-Oct-15,5
We loved our 4 day mother daughter visit in this hotel located in a fantastic location in downtown sanfrancisco! Excellent and courteous service at check in and during our stay our room was very well maintained during our stay. We were on the 25 th floor overlooking union square which was amazing. We were able to walk everywhere and it seemed every day we had questions for the concierge and all staff at the concierge desk were so friendly and helpful. Most hyatts have a great rooftop bar so disappointing that this one did not but the bar at one up was good. I would highly recommend this hotel and it is pricey but worth it.,18-Oct-15,5
"Great location in the heart of san francisco, and steps away from the union square and all the shopping you can find. The parking is an absolute rip off @ $55/day however the rooms are comfortable and the overall service is good.",18-Oct-15,5
"My wife and I spent the first 2 days of a 6 day stay in San Francisco at the Grand Hyatt. I honestly don't have anything bad to report. The location of the hotel speaks for itself. It's right next to Union Square in the heart of everything. Shopping, dining, sightseeing and much more are just a short walk away. Check in was very pleasant. A young lady named Kathleen was just genuinely kind and made the process a breeze. Our room was on the 17th floor overlooking Union Square. The room and property itself was what I'd expect from a Grand Hyatt: modern, chic, clean cut and spacious. A nice touch was automated blinds that were adjustable via a switch right by the room door and switches on either side of the bed. The only other Hyatt I'd encountered this little feature to date was the Park Hyatt Paris Vendome. The room and bathroom were very well lit, which is a big plus! Water pressure was also on point. Other than the young lady at the front desk, the only other direct contact we had with hotel employees were the doormen who greeted us each time we came back to to the hotel and a gentleman who delivered room service to us one evening. ALL employees we encountered were incredibly pleasant. You can tell that they take their guest service very seriously as they should.Speaking of room service, it was prompt, expensive and convenient. Always nice when you don't feel like heading out. Have no reservations about this hotel. As a longtime Hyatt Gold Passport Member, this hotel fits the bill of a very nice property. Location and service combine for a great experience!",17-Oct-15,5
We all enjoyed our 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt San Fran. Neighborhood is perfect for sightseeing. Love taking the trolly up and down the hills. The hotel was welcome retreat after full days of sightseeing. Comfortable beds. Modern rooms. Great service. Fabulous room service. Delicious food. Wifi worked great. Free too! Air conditioning worked very well and was quiet too. Love the automatic shades. Awesome views from our 32nd floor room. Shower and bathroom spacious. Not a huge fan of the frosted glass bathroom door but that's a minor detail. Plenty of plugs for computer equipment by bed and on desk. All in all fantastic hotel.,17-Oct-15,5
"Very central, great view from the lounge and some rooms to the bay area. Extremely nice and friendly staff and a good selection of fruits and food. Lounge is great but American style. So do not expect the drinks and cocktails all day...",14-Oct-15,5
"Stayed for 7 nights the first week of October. My room was spacious, clean and modern. Was the perfect location. The food was really good - especially the hamburger with bacon jam! I will stay there next visit for sure.",14-Oct-15,4
"The hotel staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the area,shops and tours. Located in a convenient part of the city making it e add y to wak to most destinations. The housekeeping staff does an excellent job. Would definitely stay again.",13-Oct-15,5
"We checked into the Grand Hyatt and as we expected with most Hyatt, were treated like royalty. Upon check in we were upgraded to a club level floor and given access to the club lounge. The latter was fantastic and offered a nice continental breakfast, great snacks, and evening dessert. The workout room was small but packed full of all the equipment one would need to get a good workout, plus they had a location for yoga. The room was well appointed with modern decor and the views of San Francisco were picturesque! In addition, the hotel personnel were extremely nice and hospitable. We will definitely stay here again!",13-Oct-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt is perfectly located at Union Square. Most attractions can easily be reached either on foot or by muni and cable car.On-line reservation works well, a week before arrival a reminder is being sent by email.Staff is very welcoming and specially congierge Joanna (hope her name is correctly written) was extremely helpful.Our bayviewroom had a spectacular view over the city up to Alcatraz. The room is spacious and relatively well maintained.Free wifi worked fine.Minor details : a bit annoying that one has to phone to the congierge to get f.i. a second pair of slippers or enough towels for 2 persons (although the demanded items were quickly delivered in the room). Our room had the disadvantage of being next to the icemachine, as this brings a lot of noise, specially if guests seem to be in need of ice at 4h00 am.An illogic aspect of the laundrypolicy of the hotel is, that towels are only being replaced every second day, but there is no rack in the bathroom to dry wet towels. Although not cheap, we would certainly stay again this hotel.",13-Oct-15,4
"The hotel has been remodeled and they did a good job. Very busy and a little less personal. Room services very nice. Easy to walk from location and fast taxi service. For a large hotel, one of the best in S.F.",12-Oct-15,4
"Excellent guest rooms, huge breakfasts, upper rooms have a great view, but ours was too low for that advantage of the high-rise hotel. Location is very convenient to good shopping. Room service was friendly and prompt. Elevators were sometimes slow and crowded.",12-Oct-15,5
Great hotel in the best San Francisco location. Service is attentive. Rooms are stylishly contemporary. Food at hotel restaurant is superior. Amenities what you would expect from Hyatt. We recommend it.,12-Oct-15,5
"The hotel was clean and beds were comfortable. The rooms are small but when you're on holidays you really only need a clean, comfortable place to rest your weary bones. The restaurant and lounge had average food and average service. Hotel staff were pleasant enough. The location was terrific. Close to great shops, restaurants, the cable cars and if you wanted to catch a taxi it was only a US$15 trip to Pier 39.",12-Oct-15,4
"Great hotel, clean room. Bad lounge and restaurant. It's called OneUP, should be called OneDOWN. Could use some more security at the elevators to keep the homeless out. They are everywhere! Overall the hotel is nice, and the room was fine. Slept great and the WiFi was good. Id it wasn't for business I would have stayed at an Airbnb.",11-Oct-15,4
The rooms are terribly small... The restaurant has terrible food...The bathroom door offers no privacy...the beds are so creeky and uncomfortable...But the club lounge is phenominal- I would never stay here again.,11-Oct-15,2
"I am from the Bay Area but now live in Seattle. I go to San Francisco often on business but I never stayed at the Grand Hyatt until recently and now it is one of my top picks. The hotel is located in the heart of Union Square near great restaurants, shopping and in a safe area. The hotel is very clean and has several great amenities such as an awesome gym, good restaurants and the staff is very courteous and attention to its guests. They make you feel valued and appreciated - always greeting guests, opening doors, etc..top notch service. The room service was prompt but they serve only breakfast and dinner - no lunch service available. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The management is doing a good job with their hiring and training strategies. Oh - the room dÃ©cor is incredible along with the views of the city from both the rooms and the gym.",10-Oct-15,5
"It took me awhile to search for a convenient hotel with a reasonable price, I usually choose hotels where I have loyalty programs to earn points, I made an exception for this hotel since the price and the reviews are good.The hotel is very well located Next to Union Square, shopping malls are also near by, many designer shops as well (if your traveling with your wife or girlfriend then you will end up broke by the end of your trip), the rooms are very clean and the size is good, the soundproof should have been better, the staff are amazingly friendly, be aware of the gorgeous ladies in the front desk they might capture your heart, the check in was quick since I did the online check in, and the check out was even quicker since I did it through online as well, I didn't even have to go to the front desk for the checkout and the billing was sent to my email.I rate this hotel:Location: 10/10Room: 10/10Bed comfort: 10/10Room service: 9/10Cleanness: 10/10Value of price paid for the room: 9/10Breakfast: breakfast not includedStaff: 10/10Internet/wifi: 9/10 ",10-Oct-15,5
The Grand Hyatt S.F. is a typical large Hyatt with a gazillion rooms. The rooms are smallish but the views are outstanding . The views from the Regency Club are sick.The views from the nicely equipped fitness center are great as well. The one up bar is nice and the staff is very friendly. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is on Union Square where all of the high end shops are located.,9-Oct-15,4
"I really liked the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco, nice clean and quiet is the short version but I am also happy to give a good shout out to the training room on floor 33 that had an amazing view over the town. Location is good with a Starbucks just across the street. When I visited the noise level was high early mornings due to construction in the vincinity but hopefully that should go away as soon as that is finalized.",9-Oct-15,4
"The hotel and staff were excellent from start to finish, truly a pleasure to have that kind of attention while off for a week of California Culture. The staff from front desk to housekeeping were genuinely concearned of our every needs.",8-Oct-15,5
"Best staff we have ever experienced, wonderful central location in the city, very comfortable room, great bed , view from the top floor of San Fransisco bay and skyline was breathtaking Hotel lounge delivers great service , food, and drinks",7-Oct-15,5
"Came here as a platinum member. Paid big bucks for a Club room. It happened that I left a remote from my Internet TV receiver in my room while checking out. Called the hotel same night about it, wanted to get back and pick up the remote. Unfortunately, once you out of the door, the hotel treats you as a dirt. Obviously, the remote was thrown away same day by the cleaning crew. But the hotel answering service kept transferring my inquiries to the Security Department, instead of asking the cleaning crew. Very disappointed, will never come back again.",6-Oct-15,1
"Recently stayed 5 nights at this property on business. The hotel is located in the heart of Union Square, so can be very busy with lots of tourists and vacationers. The hotel is very nice with great dÃ©cor. The rooms are modern with nice dÃ©cor and are spacious as well. The beds are not the best for comfort, but ok.Be aware that there is a building being constructed directly next to hotel on the Union Square facing side. The construction starts early, so there can be a good bit of noise. The hotel does provide ear plugs in the room, but you may want to ask for a room facing another directions, if this could bother you.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for business travel.",6-Oct-15,4
"The hotel is located in the heart of the union square. Many great restaurants and stores close to the hotel. However, there was some noise due to constructions. At all events, I loved staying at the grand hyatt San Francisco!!",6-Oct-15,4
"My husband and I were on a business trip to San Fran. We had a great time at the Hyatt. Clean room, great bathroom, fantastic view of the city and close to everything. Very friendly staff. Would definitely stay there again.",6-Oct-15,5
"From the minute we walked in, the staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful for the whole of our 5 night stay. Great location for Union Square so didn't have to walk far for restaurants or cable cars. The drinks in hotel bar were expensive (what hotel isn't) but the barman was happy to recommend a very nice Californian wine, and on one night there was a guitar player singing, which was a really nice. Our room was clean a spacious with a large very comfortable bed and loads of super comfy pillows, which from my personal experience is unusual. Would definitely stay here again.",6-Oct-15,5
"Conveniently located off Union Square. Lovely hotel with upgraded amenities. Nice and new dÃ©cor. The Club Lounge had great hot items for breakfast as well as cold items. The evening had a full array of food and open until late night. It was also open on the weekends, which some Lounges at hotels are closed over the weekends.",6-Oct-15,5
Large hotel and large hotel chain - central location - close to shopping districts and city center. Ask for room on higher floors looking out towards Bay. May be a US thing but mini bar not stocked and no free water provided in room. ,5-Oct-15,4
"I have stayed here many, many times for business over the years. The hotel experience is consistently good, and the location is great for access to business district, as well as dining options around Untion Square.",5-Oct-15,5
"This hotel is very well located by Union Square and just 2 blocks from Chinatown's dragon gate. Rooms are pricey, but very comfortable, bed, pillows and furniture are great. It is very clean and functional. Internet is slow (free) and you can upgrade for a daily fee (on top of the daily rate). Restaurants are very good as pricey as well, although the breakfast not so great and didn't have espresso (if you care for it) so you have a Starbucks across the street and some local coffee shops a block away in every direction.",5-Oct-15,5
Whole stay was very pleasant. Great hotel with good service. Wonderful location to explore San Francisco. Staff was very helpful. Great views. Would stay there again and would advise others to do the same.,5-Oct-15,4
"Had a 4 night stay in Grand Hyatt on Stockton Street in September with the family. Has a double+double room for 3 of us which was sufficient space although not much room for clothes for 3 adults. Room on the 17th floor so needed the ear plugs (supplied) due to nearby major construction works, road cleaning etc early in the morning. One gripe was the shower; hardly a modern one with low pressure and awkward controls. Staff were very helpful and polite, hotel is well placed to walk the centre of SF and easy to get to Market St for the shaopping mall etc. There is considerable road works going on which meant walking is far easier than driving! Overall, it is a big hotel that does have a lot of corporate/business clientele but is large enough for this not to be an issue. Did not try the in-house restaurant as plenty of (cheaper) options close by. It will be better when the building works next door are finished and Apple move into their new 'Cube' store.",5-Oct-15,3
"Excellent staff, clean comfortable modern rooms. A great pick for your stay in San Francisco! Close to China Town and shopping. I would definitely stay here again. Great stay for a business meeting, but would also work well for a family trip.",5-Oct-15,5
"Could not have had a better location,clean rooms,excellent amenities throughout,walking distance to many places,concierge and all staff very helpful and friendly ,great gymnasium,if booking San Francisco and you want to be central this place will be perfect,look forward to coming back one day",4-Oct-15,5
"The hotel was clean, had a helpful staff, and was located in a great location. We had a gorgeous bay view and it was worth the extra money! Enjoyed the free wifi and the treats in the lobby each night. The hotel is located a block from the cable cars and is right on union square. Would definitely stay here again.",3-Oct-15,5
"The hotel is under construction and the room we stay in is right next to where they do external work. They started working very early in the morning and our heads are like being hammered since they started. But even before they start, we cannot sleep because there is a huge gap underneath the entrance door and the hallway light is so bright it light up the room even when we shut all lights. We complained when we check out but the staff only take down my email. I haven't heard from the hotel except the automatic survey.",1-Oct-15,1
"In Grand Hyatt SF you can except excellent service, a spacious room, and if you are staying in the club floor, and excellent club lounge. We must admit we optimised the services of the concierge team not only for directions but to book our restaurants, show tickets, trip bookings, and the team delivered it with efficiency and a smile. If you are staying in this hotel which is so centrally located to all the shops, premium outlet, restuarants you need to ask the concierge team to assist you and don't burden yourself with the details. Then your stay in SF will be so much more comfortable and enjoyable.",30-Sep-15,5
I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco for a work conference the last three years. They have the best beds and pillows in the industry. Their housekeeping staff is very kind and the valets out front are courteous and look very professional. I really appreciate that they have a good restaurant and coffee bar in the hotel.,30-Sep-15,5
We were warmly greeted by the front desk and bell staff which contributed greatly to the hotel achieving a boutique fell in spite of being a large property. We will certainly stay at this property again.,30-Sep-15,5
"My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco in the beginning of June. We could tell immediately we were going to enjoy our stay. They upgraded our room to a higher floor, overlooking Union Square. Not five minutes in the room and we get a phone call making sure the room was good. Then were asked if we enjoy baseball and if we'd be interested in attending the Giants game that night. Awesome!! Love it. We were able to walk to the ballpark and walk home.My wife and I enjoy walking. The hotel is in a great location and streetcar stops nice and close. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Thank you Grang Hyatt SF for an amazing stay!! And the Giants tickets!!",29-Sep-15,5
"Let me preface this review by stating that I travel a lot for work and personal trips. I can honestly say that the Grand Hyatt San Francisco is one of the nicest and best hotels I have had the pleasure of staying at.The rooms are spacious with luxurious beds and decor. I am never very impressed with hotel beds but their selection of beds and sheets gave me one of the best night's sleep I have ever had on the road. I was lucky enough to have a higher floor room with an amazing view. Everything in the room is updated and modern.The service staff was warm and friendly and made sure I was well taken care of. Their hotel bar and lounge is very nice and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of drinks and their selection.I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city who wishes to be met with welcoming staff, amazing service, a great location, and a wonderful stay.",29-Sep-15,5
"We recently stayed at the hotel in September. It was my first time visiting SF, actually first time in California! The hotel is a high rise, and situated in the center of the Union Square area of SF. Perfect location, albeit fairly busy and touristy. Our room was a good size. They put us in a handicap accessible room. We were on the 22nd floor and the view was of the Union Square (across from Macy's)...really pretty at night time!All in all, a good hotel. It's location is definitely a plus. It's within a 2 block walk of Chinatown, and there is a trolley stop within 2 blocks as well. It's also fairly close (about 1 mile) from Fisherman's Wharf. We also took a cab to the Mission area. Finally, a one BIG plus was the customer service we received at the end of our stay, actually, we had already checked out. We had left an Ipad and Bose headphones in the room safe, and we were already in Santa Clara. We called the hotel, and they had opened the safe and had our items! Apparently, if a room safe is closed, they open it prior to the next guest. We made arrangements to pick our items up a couple days later. So kudos to Security for helping us!",29-Sep-15,4
"Located in the heart of Union Square, this hotel is in the center of everything (Shopping, Food, China Town, & more) The building is also one of the tallest I've seen in the area so there are some killer views if you have the right room. The hotel itself is very nice and checks the box for just about anything you could want. We particularly enjoyed the small surprises like complementary pop corn and candy in the lobby one afternoon. They even had breakfast treats from starbucks some mornings. These little things stood out to us and made our visit more enjoyable.It's hard not to recommend this hotel for anyone. It's good for just about everything. ",29-Sep-15,4
"Great central location! Exceptional service! Good Food! Very knowledgeable concierge! Nice quiet room! Clean bathroom! Easy check in/check out. Staff was kind, courteous and helpful! Will stay there again.",29-Sep-15,5
"This is my 2nd time staying here, location is the reason why I chose this hotel again. In the heart of Union Square, shops, restaurants are just nearby! Hotels rooms are clean and the size is just right (for not more than 2 persons)!",29-Sep-15,4
"Was very pleased with the location, service and comfort of the Grand Hyatt Union Square. A great hotel and staff that listens to your requests. The rooms were spacious and the restaurant and bar were warm and inviting.",29-Sep-15,5
We stayed three nights in this wonderful hotel in Union Square. The location was superb. The staff could not have been nicer. We had a room on 31st floor with a splendid view of downtown San Francisco and the breakfast was brilliant. Would stay there again any time.,29-Sep-15,5
"Great location in San Francisco, close to Union Square. Lovely staff who took great care of our needs, especially Maria at the Front Desk and Randy at the front door. Would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting San Francisco.",29-Sep-15,4
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for two days during a business meeting. Hotel appears to have recently been renovated. Rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Bed was nice as well. Internet service was a little slow (could have been because I was a corner room) but overall I enjoyed my stay.",28-Sep-15,5
"We had a room with bay views so we had a magnificent panoramic view of the city and the bay beyond from very large windows. Everything was great, but the only disappointing thing was that the top floor which is supposed to wonderful views all around the city is off limits except for special functions. Immaculate room, very friendly, accommodating staff ready to help. Highly recommend. Enjoy!",28-Sep-15,4
Grand Hyatt reflects San Francisco perfectly. The staff was so nice and accommodating I felt like I've known them for years. Would love to come back and visit again with my wife. The location is perfect!,28-Sep-15,5
"Loved this place. Almost perfect.few things here and there which need attention.Have stayed in other hyatts in metro cities and this is by far the best one,Location is close to everything. Lots of good restaurants, shopping,china town, fishermans wharf.  Starbucks kiosk is available in the lobby and a store is across the street.Ron, at checkin was very friendly and welcomed us with big smile but g",27-Sep-15,5
"A beautiful hotel, super friendly and helpful staff. The room was spotless, modern and did not have that 'worn out' look so many big city hotel rooms do. I had an amazing view of the financial district, Chinatown and the bay from my room. Surprisingly little street noise which made for a restful sleep. If you want the best view of the city, go up to the 36th floor and look around. I'm sure they don't encourage this, but it is the best view of the city and the bay by far.",27-Sep-15,5
"Were staying as a family during July 4th at The Grand Hyatt. Great view on Union Square (large Windows), top quality beds and bathroom, great breakfirst selection and also very good restaurant (high prices though). I can recommend this Hotel for business and pleasure and will return again.",27-Sep-15,5
Excellent hotel at Union Square near a variety of very good restaurants. Staff is very professional and friendly. They remember you if you have been a guest before. The lounge has good snack food and cocktails. The servers are very pleasant.,26-Sep-15,5
"Everything was wonderful - we will definitely be back. The hotel was nice and comfortable and the staff made our stay excellent. We checked in early without and question, received good recommendations from the staff, and were always greeted with a smile.",25-Sep-15,5
"Great hotel. Modern, comfortable room - great bed. The staff makes sure that you feel at home. Everything is first rate. Love their mobile entry app. And the missing items service is a nice perk. Would not hesitate to stay at this location the next time I'm visiting San Francisco.",25-Sep-15,5
"Great hotel and stay. This is the level of service I expect from a Hyatt. I hope to visit again. The rooms were clean and updated. Had a great view of the city from a high floor. Obviously parking is very expensive, I would cab next time and just uber/lfyt around the city.",24-Sep-15,4
"We stayed the hotel with our kids and we all surtisfied. The hotel is very convenient and close to the cable car, drug store, and shopping center. The staff at concierge desk was very kind and did the confrimeation for the tour for me. The door men was very friendly and great, too.",24-Sep-15,5
"Was able to have 3 rooms on same floor high enough to avoid noise. Valet/bellman/front desk/room service attendant all excellent & friendly. Checking in/out fast. Rooms clean & sufficient towels. Plenty of room for 2 ladies to share a room w/large vanity in bathroom and space to keep items off floor. Convenience of frig & safe. Great views even from 16th floor. Room service prompt w/temperature of food just right. Comfy beds & good pillows. Helpful concierge w/great suggestions. Great, safe location to walk to tons of stores/restaurants. Would return to this Hyatt. Valet expensive ($60+) but in center of downtown (very quick retrieval)",24-Sep-15,5
"Took our two 13 year olds to San Fran for a girls weekend and stayed here for two nights. Newer hotel with a modern look and feel. Plenty of front desk and front door staff to help. Rooms are on the smaller side with beds that are full not queen. It was hard to share. Beds are also very soft with that top layer of fluff that some people love. I prefer more firm so this was kinda an issue for me but not a deal breaker and again if you like that thick pillow top feel you'll be happy. Location is great and is an easy walk to union square or china town, etc. a lot of construction going on but no noise in the room. Did not have the chance to sample the in house food options but it looked good. Would stay again.....if I got my own bed!",23-Sep-15,4
"Were in room on 26th floor with amazing bay view, hotel is located in the heart of SF, everything is pretty close. Left a car with only $41/day, only few blocks away there's all shopping area, Starbucks cafe on every corner, opens early, closes late. ",23-Sep-15,5
"I stayed here on two different occasions in June/July. One was with a friend- which happened to be during pride. She had a great room with doors that opened onto the parade- I believe she booked a basic room and didn't have Hyatt status. Without a doubt, look to this place for a late June stay for the location. I was at both the Hilton Union Square (don't bother) and the Westin St. Francis (fine enough but I used points) for comparison.I booked again for one night two weeks later off the California Zephyr. I was disappointed my original room didn't have a window that opened, but after a call they upgrade me to a room with a balcony. I'd definitely give this place a go for visitors. ",23-Sep-15,4
"If a hotel provides you with ear plugs this is already a bad sign. At the Grand Hyatt in S. F. you definitely need them!! There was already a lot of noise coming up to my room (22nd floor) from Union Square but really bad is the major construction work in the Neighborhood going on 24/7. This will stay there for a long time... The location is great, but the staff is rather unfriendly. The breakfast area is small and I had to wait long. Service here is very slow, too. If I pay close to $500 I expect MUCH more. I will definitely not come back... ",23-Sep-15,2
"This is a great place to stay and is a great value at the weekend rate. Accesible to public transportation and a short walk into the financial district, embarcadero and China town. The happy hour is worth a try and the service was amazing.",23-Sep-15,5
"The hotel occupies a central location, with a few restaurants housed within. We stayed in an Executive Suite using Hyatt Gold Passport points. The room was spacious. Our only complaint was that part of the room had a rotten egg odor. The hotel was good as a departure point for exploring the city. The hotel is often used as a site for conventions, so it can feel a bit crowded/lively in the lobby areas. Note that the hotel lacks an indoor swimming pool.",22-Sep-15,3
"Stayed here for 3 nights for my birthday, location wise very close to union square (2mins) and Chinatown (5mins). As with most Hyatts the hotel is of a very high standard with great facilities especially the gym which had great views over the city. Rooms were of high standard again with good views and comfort. Nice bars and restaurants maybe not so cheap but worth a visit if you wish not to venture too far one evening. As San Fran is a expensive city to stay with hotel costs I would highly recommend it should your budget stretch. I expect to return on my next visit soon",22-Sep-15,4
A great hotel in a great location --- the regency club is a great feature and is highly recommended. This was a pretty good deal despite the salesforce convention pushing availability down all across the city.,22-Sep-15,5
"It's very perfect hotel for business trip in union square area, this is my second stay in Grand Hyatt - it's really awesome. I think one concern area is road work happening more than 2 years nearby that causes some commutation problem",21-Sep-15,5
"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 days while attending the Dreamforce Conference and loved everything about this decision. The hotel was close enough to the Moscone Center but not that close, so it wasn't affected by the crazy traffic around the area. Rooms are very spacious and luxurious, and the Staff handled all my requests promptly. The complimentary popcorn and lemonade in the afternoon were a nice surprise while I was waiting for my airport ride. Would definitely recommend!",21-Sep-15,5
Rooms were new & renovated - NICE! It was close to everything that I needed for work. Concierge was beyond fabulous & check in was easy. Best part every morning they were happy smiling people that greeted me with enthusiasm even at 4 am,21-Sep-15,5
"This is what every 5-star Hotel should strive to be. Every staff member was a pro: friendly, respectful, genuine, well-informed, eager to make my visit enjoyable and uncomplicated. From the curb-side Bell-Hops to the Laundry and everyone in-between, this staff knows how to make you feel like an MVP. And the experience didn't end at the Hotel: the ride back to the Airport flew by as the Limousine driver was able to engage with us in a wide-ranging and lively discussion of business such that I wished the drive had required a bit more time. I was in the city for 5 days, and normally I would be in a hurry to get home, but I found myself entertaining the thought of staying a little longer.",21-Sep-15,5
"We stayed in a club room and they provided food and drink for us each morning and night. The staff was nice. Our room was normal, but the view was amazing. The location is great for shopping, eating, and public transport. A nice safe part of town.",20-Sep-15,4
"I have stayed in SF many time and this is my first choice for hotel. I usually have to go to the Moscone Convention Center and the walk is not too bad. I choose to be closer to shopping and food options than closer to the Convention Center which is generally boring.The rooms here are always clean as you would expect from Hyatt.Sometimes when I check in I am a little too early, Hyatt seems to have always found room for me when I get there which is great because I have usually been flying quite a few hours by the time I arrive. I know this isn't guaranteed, so I consider myself lucky.There is some construction going on next-door as they are building the new Apple Store. My stay was July 2015 and they should be finished with the new store summer of 2016. Even though construction is usually seen as a bad thing, I did not hear a peep from them any of the 6 nights I stayed. My co-worker also said the same thing.Even though I usually go for business, I have actually stayed here for vacation. It makes a good home base in the center of town.Also, finding a Taxi is no sweat in front of this hotel as there are always a swarm of them waiting. Have also done lyft and Uber, as there is ample room for them to pick-up/drop off,Lobby has a cool feel to it with modern furniture.WiFi is also quite good at this hotel with my experience.",20-Sep-15,5
"On our way to Maui, we decided to spend a couple of days in San Francisco. We had booked a double room in advance and were excited about our stay. We had also let the hotel know that we were on our honeymoon. When we arrived, we were told that they had no more double beds and were given a room with twin beds instead. We were offered some free amenities as a compensation and were asked to mark something on a list. Not the most elegant way, but it's the thought that counts, so we picked up some Californian wine and strawberries. Unfortunately the free amenities never got to our room and nobody apologized or bothered to ask if everything was OK during our stay. I find it really sad to pay and tip generously and get mediocre service. The hotel pays no attention whatsoever to detail. Maybe you have to be a diamond or platinum member in order to not be treated like a second class guest. If you want quality, book somewhere else! ",20-Sep-15,3
"We love staying at the Hyatt SF Union Square. Great service, food and view of the city , bay & Alcatraz. We enjoyed the Grand club with happy hour and breakfast. The staff was friendly, courteous and accomodating.",20-Sep-15,5
"The lobby entrance is dark and not too impressive. The room doors and the hallway walls are scuffed. I had to ask two days in a row for housekeeping to vacuum because the floors were not clean, with someone else's hair on my floors. The first time I'd asked for the floors to be vacuumed, my request was ignored. The gym was extremely awkward, with a broken scale, some equipment a bit squeaky, and the stretching area basically in the elevator bank. Not impressive at all. Positives included a gorgeous bar on the mezzanine floor with attentive service, a super bell desk staff who were always friendly and helpful, and a nice bathroom sink area with a modern look. ",19-Sep-15,2
"We stayed here for 5 nights last week, and we were pretty happy with the hotel overall. Upon check in, we were helped very quickly, and upgraded to a higher floor with a better view for being a Platinum member. The view was beautiful from the 36th floor, and the layout of the room was very nice, it even had a vanity area with a makeup mirror. We had the ""Romance"" package during the first 2 nights which included champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and free breakfast buffet at One Up located in the hotel. The buffet was small, but was satisfying enough for us. There wasn't many choices, a couple different eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and pastries. At $25 a head, I wouldn't have paid for it if it wasn't included in our package. We stayed in Napa for a couple nights and returned for another 3 night stay here. The second room wasn't as nice as the first, but still on a high floor. Overall, both rooms were very clean, and the bathrooms had beautiful finishes. The pillows were not comfortable at all, way too soft and flat. I requested the foam pillows, and they weren't much better. In the room they have a card that lists amenities that you can call for and it stated that they would deliver it in a bag and hang it on your door knob and knock when its been delivered. Both times that I called for things to be sent to my room, the people that delivered the items were waiting for me to come to the door, presumably for a tip. I don't mind tipping them, but I don't feel that it is right to advertise that the items will be left for you with a simple knock to let you know it's there, and then have the staff wait around for tips. On our last morning there, we were packing everything up and getting ready for our flight back to Hawaii. I searched high and low for my Gucci carry on bag that I had folded flat in my suitcase for the duration of our trip. It was nowhere to be found. We had been so busy doing things on our last few days there, I hadn't even noticed it was missing until I needed it. Our room was tucked away at the end of a hallway, no one was ever around when we would enter or leave our room, and it was definitely there and now it was gone. It's quite easy to come to the conclusion that the maid(s) took it. I filed a complaint with security and I still have not received a phone call, that they said I would get a couple days after I left on Sunday. So overall, the hotel is in a great location and really nice compared to the other hotels that I looked at in San Fran, and at a reasonable rate. Noise wasn't a problem either.I would definitely stay here again, depending on how this situation is handled. I definitely will not allow maids in my room again. I spent well over $1000 here and it would have been completely worth it....if my $600+ bag wasn't stolen.",18-Sep-15,4
"The Grand Hyatt at Union Square is excellent. The location, the service and room quality is excellent as well. Although the rooms are typically Hyatt, they have been renovated in recent years and are clean. I can recommend this hotel without question.",18-Sep-15,5
"My husband and I spent two nights at the Grand Hyatt and had a wonderful stay. The hotel staff is very pleasant and the concierge was very helpful. We got lots of great tips for our visit to SF. The rooms, of course, are well appointed and very comfortable. Only thing is there is major construction going on for a few blocks on Stockton Street so it is a bit hectic trying to navigate the streets around Union Square. We found that it is a short, easy walk to Chinatown. As per one of the listed directions we took the BART from the airport and got off at Powell Street. We then discovered that it is a 5 block, uphill walk to Sutter Street and then 2 blocks over to Stockton where the hotel is located. If you don't mind walk, otherwise grab a cab. Overall, we had a great stay and will definitely book this hotel on a future visit to San Francisco. ",18-Sep-15,5
"This hotel has a wonderful location...if you can splurge for a club room...the breakfasts and hapoy hour is awesome, and David there is great..we stayed there 3 days on our way to Napa, the shopping is everywhere around the hotel...saks and macys and nordstrom, but also a lot of the high end boutiques and the normal stores..China town is a skip and a jump away.... I definitely recommend this hotel",17-Sep-15,4
"Our stay was on July 9th for 3 nights. The staff at this hotel is courteous and friendly. The room spacious; linen fresh; room very clean. Our view was spectacular. The location at Union Square can't get any better. Walking distance to shopping, restaurants. Hotel has off parking type of valet at a reasonable price. Breakfast was included in my rate; it was worth it. Great service. We would go back to this hotel. Our experience was totally positive. Just a great stay.",17-Sep-15,5
Our experience started with super friendly and helpful staff at check-in. We were able to check in a little after noon which was nice since this was technically early. The room had a great view but the view from the fitness center was even better. Both my husband and I commented that the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The location is close to everything in SF,17-Sep-15,5
Had a very enjoyable stay at the Grand Hyatt. The hotel is located right on Union Square within a few minutes of all the shops and restaurants. Room was very comfortable and had a tasty late dinner one night in the hotel restaurant. Highly recommended.,15-Sep-15,5
"Thanks to Yelp for getting us such a great discount staying at Grand Hyatt Hotel. Excellent location. Walking distance to many tourist attraction in downtown. Hotel concierge even offers walking distance self-guide tour list. Very useful!!!The service has been amazing since the moment we checked in the hotel. We received welcome gift few minutes after we got to our room. Great room on 26th Floor!Room is clean and modern. Housekeeping is so friendly and attentive. All the service are absolutely ""A+""!!!Fitness Center on 35th floor is breathtaking. The floor to ceiling windows totally showcase downtown San Francisco. The bonus of our stay.... complimentary cookies with YELP logo!! We are here for Yelp 10 Year Anniversary Celebration and the hotel really makes all the Elite Yelpers feeling very special.",15-Sep-15,5
"I am very impressed with the staff. Everyone is super courteous and one comes away feeling that they genuinely care. The amenities are standard but they will loan you almost anything, including curling irons. Well kept, modern rooms as well.",15-Sep-15,5
"We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed the experience. A great base from which to explore SF, an old trolley ride away from the piers, a bus ride from the Golden Gate bridge park and a walk to catch ferries to view sights from the sea. Tastefully modernised rooms and lobby/restaurants and courteous staff who helped with anything. Only grouse was the creak of the building in the wind.....I've never had that experience before and when we called reception to ask about it they said yes it was because of the way the building was designed to withstand earthquakes?! Reassured by that the creaking didn't keep us awake.....but surely there is a way to design against earthquakes without the creaking!!",14-Sep-15,4
"The hotel lobby and entrance seems dated.Rooms were your typical Hyatt rooms,more of business than pleasure.Bathroom was also ordinary.The staff were courteous esp. the room service were quick.Location is fantastic as in the heart of union square.The high cost can only be justified by the location.",13-Sep-15,3
"Okay this is our 3rd visit to this hotel. Stayed in the Clubroom on the 31st floor. Hotel very well located and most areas are walkable to. Hotel was busy over the 4 nights we stayed but staff were always pleasant .I have always requested a bay view prior to my stays but have never recivied one. I did put this request on my booking but was disappointed on check in this was not noticed until I remarked on it, I was told no bay views available but I will give you a room with a nice view, turned out to be a view from the rear of the hotel onto the flat roof of another hotel, just a minor issue but it would be nice for requests to be looked at and I do appreciate these cannot always be honoured.Anyway room itself was fine and the Grand Club facility was excellent, staff always cheerfull and helpful and willing to make effort to have a conversation.good selection of hot and cold drinks and beer and wine at $3. Plenty to eat for breakfast and nice snacks of an evening.Great Hotel to stay in. Thank you Hyatt",13-Sep-15,5
"I was at Grand Hyatt San Francisco during last WWDC, Apple Event. It was very near the place, so for me was very good, but it looks I little bit far from San Francisco turistic attractions. The included breakfast was very good, but I not sure it is included in every reservation, I was using a business agreement. If you are going by your one, check it before. The room was very good, big and clean.",13-Sep-15,4
"Overall we had a great stay at the Grand Hyatt. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and seemed eager to assist. In fact, we were most impressed by the service offered at this facility. Although we arrived early, we were offered early check in and were given a complimentary bottle of wine after the hotel recognized that it was our anniversary.The room was clean and modern, and although the hotel acknowledged that construction was going on in the area, we did not experience any problems with noise. We had a partial view of the bay, which was great!! We had lunch at the hotelâ€™s restaurant on the first day and fell in love with the food! Finally, the location of this hotel was perfect for us!",13-Sep-15,5
"Nice hotel, very modern. Close to MUNI so very easy to get around. Lobby was nice and room had some nice features, the blinds were amazing. Was there for a conference. Nice facilities for that. Cleanliness is my biggest concern with hotels. First room we were given had dirt on the bed and garbage in the room. Got switched to a room on a lower floor, directly across from very loud ice machine. Definite downgrade. New room,first three towels I picked up had hair on them (not from me), there was also hair in the tub. Gross. I actually looked at the sheets before getting into bed. Rest of stay was nice and staff were friendly but that really turned me off.",13-Sep-15,3
"Great hotel and location. Only issue was not their fault: construction noise next door. Great views, and tranquil room. Lots of hotel choices in San Francisco, this hotel stands out for ambiance. Next trip I plan to visit the OneUp hotel bar, looks interesing.",11-Sep-15,5
"The location is excellent but all else did not live up to expectation. The room was adequate and clean but small with no view. Breakfast NOT included feels like a penalty, come off it Grand Hyatt what's grand about that! Didn't eat in for dinner either although we were not invited to either.The reception is more like a hot desk zone or drop in centre with no privacy and an immigration like policy of ""stand behind the line"" which does not make one feel welcome!

enjoyed the location and nice to see the real sf not just tourist locations. Walkable to port ferry building and chinatown . The room was on the 8 th floor and quiet. Take a trip to the 35th floor to the fitness center and enjoy the view of the bay. The vending machine stoled my money but i will get over it. There is filtered water machine up there also. Its easy to get transportation to airport by bart(8.95 short walk from powell st station) or airport shuttle (16 dollars) .,10-Sep-15,4
"Haven't stayed here for the last several years, but glad I did so this time. The hotel has been completely remodeled and the rooms are great. We were on the 30th floor with huge windows overlooking the cityscape. Rooms are very conveniently equipped... Power outlets easily accessible for charging tech items and phones, sophisticated lighting system, adjustable reading lights at both sides of bed, separate small vanity area outside bathroom. The beds are all white, with great linens and very comfortable. Baths have beautiful tiled showers and modern vessel sinks. I didn't want to leave! Be sure to take advantage of the club room if you can. The setting is magnificent, views all the way to the bay. The room is large and very comfortable, breakfast is extensive and gourmet.Negatives: 1. lobby is an awkward configuration and feels very cramped and corporate. Some seating areas terribly uncomfortable, with very low chairs that are hard to get in and out of. Definitely all about business, not leisure. 2. Smokers linger outside in front of the hotel and are too close to the property, so smoke wafting in leaves a lingering cigarette odor that is unpleasant.On the positive side, there is a coffee bar in the lobby, and lemonade and popcorn some afternoons.",10-Sep-15,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt at the End of August for 5 nights. This is the second time that we have stayed at this wonderful hotel. Our room was on the 17th floor, overlooking Union square. Our room was cleaned to a very high standard every day. My Husband told Maria at check in that it was going to be our 34th wedding Anniversary during our stay she arranged for champagne and chocolates to be sent to our room, courtesy of the hotel. This was very thoughtful:) all the staff were very helpful and friendly at the hotel.",9-Sep-15,4
I stayed here for my friends wedding and the hotel served its purpose perfectly. The small lobby bar worked for the small wedding party for pre drinks and although the rooms aren't large (as expected in a city hotel) they were still roomy and nicely acquainted. Hyatt remodeled this hotel a few years ago (thankfully) and it is now a favorite of ours when we are visiting. We used to live in San Francisco and enjoy the central location this hotel provides.,9-Sep-15,4
"Very clean rooms. Excellent service. Friendly staff who wen tout of their way to satisfy.Only downside is the construction for the MUNI subway line extension going on right outside the hotel on Stockton St. Not their fault, Just letting others know.",9-Sep-15,5
"As always a great place to stay. Our room on the 25th floor had an amazing view of Alcatraz, Coit Tower and Angel Island. The staff is responsive and very polite. The room was also very comfortable and exceptionally clean. We loved the ""feel"" of the lobby and mezzanine bar. We have stayed here twice and will definitely be back.",9-Sep-15,5
"Location is right in the heart of SF city center, surrounded by great Restaurants, shops, department store, and hub of transportation. Famous tram on Powell street is at the Conner. Great courtesy of hotel staffs.",9-Sep-15,5
"massive construction all around the hotel. rooms been to be up-dated, TV did not work properly, black out drapes would not lower, cheap quality to room. The room was very clean and the staff is very friendly, but unable to fit the problems in my room.",9-Sep-15,2
"My fiancee and I stayed here over the Labor Day weekend in one of their larger corner rooms. The hotel itself is very pretty, is modern, and has many nice thoughtful touches such as books in the rooms, motorized shades, and they even provided free treats in the lobby on Sunday. While I am used to primarily staying in huge suites, as I travel to Las Vegas often, I can say that the room was a good sized with a good sized bathroom as well. For San Francisco this is a rarity as the majority of hotels here, even at the 4/5 star level have rooms that are the size of a walk in closet in Vegas. I feel that Grand Hyatt is significantly better than the Fairmont or the Intercontinental Mark as both are overpriced, and are frankly decaying. Also their service was far below the high standard set by Grand Hyatt. I also enjoyed OneUp's restaurant and their lounge. The food and drinks were quite good, as was the service and the ambiance. The only negatives with my stay here were that the hotel doesn't have a pool and parking is ridiculous. The hotel doesn't have its own garage so you have to park in one across the street or valet. Valet was, I think $62 a day. Look, I am far from cheap and I know that this charge is the norm in San Francisco, but that still doesn't make it right. Even in LA it is cheaper and I think LA prices are ridiculous. I also noticed that there was a large gap between the floor and our door and the rooms weren't soundproofed too well, though this is also the norm for San Fran. This all being said the hotel deserves it 4 star rating. Actually I would give it 4.25 stars if that were a thing. I would also highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be in the middle of the action in San Fran. It is next to Union Square, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and is a few minutes walk to the Bart Station and Chinatown.",7-Sep-15,4
"My husband and I were here for four nights over this Labor Day weekend. The service was excellent, the room was clean, the restaurant and drinks were yummy. I missed having a coffee maker in the room as it's the first thing I do when waking up. Apparently there is a coffee ""cart"" in the lobby but I have no desire to get dressed and go down to get a cup of coffee. They have complementary juice and snack in the afternoon. We had an issue with the adjoining room having a party and making a huge amount of noise. At 10:30 I called the front desk and the lady asked me by name ""how can I help you""?I told her what was going on and in no time security was there to intervene. ",7-Sep-15,4
"How do you love a hotel chain and hate it as well? When we stayed at the Berlin Germany Grand Hyatt in July of 2014, I wrote a Tripadvisor review about how we loved everything about that hotel except that the air conditioning was substandard. No matter how low we adjusted the temperature it was too hot in our room. Guess what happened in San Francisco? We absolutely loved everything about this hotel especially the Staff, the Club Room, the amazing service we received and the cleanliness of our room, but the Air Conditioning was terrible! Yes, it was not hot outside to some peoples standards, but walking up and down the hills of San Francisco several hours in 73 to 75 degrees can be warming to say the least. I would loved to have come back to my hotel suite to cool down at my requested 68 degrees. The temperature in the room was 72 degrees despite the setting on the thermostat. (Yes, I had the blind shades pulled down all day). I should not have had to take a cool shower to cool off, but that is exactly what I had to do. Twice, I had hotel maintenance attend my suite to improve the performance of the A/C, to no avail. An employee confided in me that the hotel policy (all Grand Hyatt Hotels) was to restrict the A/C to rooms in order to save energy and therefore money. That would explain the exact same problem we had in Berlin.I am all for saving the environment, but when I am spending some pretty big bucks to stay at a luxury hotel, I don't want to lay awake sweating into my sheets trying to fall asleep.If I stay at a Grand Hyatt again, it will be at a winter resort. I hope the windows will open.",7-Sep-15,3
"Awesome view from 33rd floor, service was outstanding, room comfortable, gym quite good, club lounge excellent. We stayed there for a getaway weekend in SF and everything went smoothly, exceeding expectations.",7-Sep-15,5
The location of this hotel is perfect. All the big store are super close and really good restaurant as well. The hotel have an awesome bar. Order the Moscow is just amazing! Staff is very friendly and the room is very clean with good decor. Definitely worth the money. ,6-Sep-15,5
"This was our first stay at Grand Hyatt San Francisco and we loved it! Staff were very friendly and helpful, room was spacious, modern and came with an amazing cityscape view. Location at Union Square was very central to all cafes, restaurants, awesome shopping and close to all major tourist spots. We will definitely be back.",5-Sep-15,5
This Grand Hyatt is right on Union Square and in the middle of everything! Currently they are doing a lot of construction on the Union Square side of the hotel so I requested to be on the other side. The rooms were clean and nice and the staff here really is fantastic. They were all very friendly and helpful any time I talked to them the hotel is close to the Cable car and Streetcar lines and lots of great restaurants. I would definitely stay here again!,5-Sep-15,5
"If you are visiting San Francisco, I am pretty impressed and definitely recommend this hotel. Great staff members and good service. Most of all great location for sightseeing, restaurants and shopping.",5-Sep-15,5
"Attended a conference in SF and always stay here. Great location away from the Moscone conference center crowds. Having the park across the street is a nice retreat to people watch. Staff, check in and great lobby are all pluses.",5-Sep-15,4
"This is not the Hyatt we have experienced in other locations. Staff was polite and helpful, however it does not make up for the lack of everything else. Belhop was snooty and pretentious acting. Not at all interested in helping us with our luggage.Our room was clean but nothing special. I do think that extra effort could be made to remove water spots, smudges, and streaks throughout. Although we did have a good nights sleep, the entire building seemed tired. For the price, we will try elsewhere on our next trip to S.F.",4-Sep-15,3
"I had a great weekend stay that was very restful at the Grand Hyatt. The room, service, and fitness center were all really good. I have stayed at several hotels by Union Square, and I would definitely consider staying at the Grand Hyatt again.",4-Sep-15,5
"My wife and i made our first visit to San Francisco to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary and our stay at the Grand Hyatt made the trip all the more special. The views from our room on the 17th floor were spectacular, the hotel was conveniently located, and the staff were very attentive and helpful. Their crab omelet is a must have for breakfast!",3-Sep-15,5
"My wifey and I stayed here and really enjoyed it. First off, itâ€™s perfectly located to just about anything in San Francisco. Right in the middle of all the shopping, great places to eat, a mile away from ATT Stadium, a couple blocks from Chinatown, right next to the trolley line, etc. We easily strolled to and from the ballpark, grabbing a couple of drinks along the way. Additionally, the staff was very friendly, extremely helpful with directions, and helping us tape up a box of wine before departing for the airport. The rooms were nicely sized, clean, and very comfortable. I usually hit the gym and use Wi-Fi, but didnâ€™t have the chance during this shorter stay. The only complaints may have been the noise from the busy street and the $80 valet parking, but any major city center youâ€™re going to get noise. End result, if I were going back to San Francisco I would definitely check availability at the Grand Hyatt.",2-Sep-15,4
"This hotel is facing away from Union Square but is in a great area. Check-in was a breeze with friendly staff from bell boys to reception. Hotel is up to date and quite quaintly small and cozy. There is a fire going for the chilly days which is warming and welcoming in the lobby area!Rooms are a bit small for 2 check-in bags but is clean and modern. Window opens a few inches for fresh air. There is an automatic black-out shade Air conditioning was good. Sheets and bed was heavenly. Housekeeping is wonderful and cleans that room perfectly leaving us with more than adequate amenities and wonderfully made beds. Breakfast was a small area which is always close to being full. Staff were super attentive and wonderful with service. However, the breakfast buffet was really small compared to the ones we have in Asia. All dishes were western such as scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages, oatmeal and a selection of fruits. Quite surprised by the small buffet available. Coffee machine was in the room. I had requested for a tea kettle one day when I was on the way back to my room and was surprised when the front desk asked me to use the coffee machine instead to heat the water. Well, no surprises when I didn't manage to get my cup of tea for the entire trip. Apart from that hiccup, this is a great hotel and wonderful place to stay in.",1-Sep-15,5

In town for leisure. Perfect location. Walk to china town. Shopping. Dining. The train. Room had a great view. The room was nicely furnished. Clean most importantly. Upon arriving front office staff very welcoming. Will definitely stay here again.,1-Sep-15,5
"Love this hotel, the staff is always so nice and arranges our room before we show up if we have an occasion. The suite is amazing and is so worth the extra money!

Grand Hyatt stay was just what I needed. Only had one night to stay in San Fran and the Grand Hyatt did a great job getting me into my room early and out the next day without any issues. Would recommend this as a friendly and well maintained hotel. Staff was great and accomidating.,31-Aug-15,4
"I stayed 5 nights in the Grand Hyatt SF. Since walking in i felt that the Hotel's lobby to be small compared to the size of the hotelâ€_ Lobby always gave me a feeling of being full all the time. Going up to the room, We stayed in a Grand CLub room. Room is large, with a nice bathroom. huge bed, automatic drapes, nice small closet for 1, and a huge glass walking shower, no curtains.Grand Club lounge isn't one of the largest we've been. BUt it was nice. The STaff in the Lounge was just perfect! Always attentive and willing to help. It was the highlight of the stay for sure. we used the lounge a lot, they made us feel welcome all the time.The Hotels location was the best! we walked all around the neighborhood. It has high end shops and plazas and great places to eat. couldn't be better. fantastic.I used the online checkout, worked fine for me. really nice touch of being a hyatt gold passport and getting point for my stay.",30-Aug-15,4
"This is a wonderful place to stay in SF. The staff is fabulous-knowledgeable and accommodating. Location is great-near to transportation, restaurants & sights. Parking is expensive, but that is true all through SF",30-Aug-15,5
"This is place that has a great location convenient to downtown financial and the shops around Union Square. If you get a high floor room you would have a very good view of San Francisco. If you do not pay enough or do not get lucky with a higher floor room you can always go up to the top floor for a drink or a meal and have one of the best view the city has to offer. Even if you are not staying here it is worthwhile taking the trip to get the magnificent view, specially in a clear day. It is indeed a treat to stay here.",29-Aug-15,5
"This is a solid hotel, befitting of the Hyatt brand. Beware there is a bunch of construction around Union square, but still it's a great location for eating, drinking, shopping and anything else you'd want to do in SF.Pros:Nice, modern hotel. Typical of HyattGreat service from front desk and bell deskGood location, minus the constructionCons:Restaurant is too small for the size of the hotelSan Francisco was dirtier, smellier, full of homeless people than ever. I love going here for 24-72 hours, but this city is going down hill",28-Aug-15,4
"Beautiful renovated hotel in the heart of the city in Union Square. Very friendly check in and check out, eager to help doormen, and prompt response when we buzzed for a couple housekeeping and toiletry items. The lady at the concierge was helpful and informative, gave us great advice for on places we needed to know and how to get therr, and a map of the main points of attraction. The restaurant has a wonderful breakfast buffet that is bang for your buck if you book a Breakfast Rate room. Would stay at again for sure. Beds super comfy, shower and bathroom clean and updated, comp wifi.",27-Aug-15,5

"Visited USA in July. This hotel is best for people who love to shop. It is right next to union square and everything from restaurants to big branded shops are a minute away. I feel it is better to live near union square than fisherman's wharf as this place is more lively. Ben the receptionist was very sweet and friendly at the time of check in. Location- best location to stayRooms- they are decent rooms, spacious. As construction going on near the hotel. Try taking the rooms on higher floors to reduce noise. Service- good service. We were disturbed around 12 am by a knock on the door and there were two people on the door sent by the hotel. They presumed there was no one in the room. We felt really annoyed and weird about it. At the time of check out they gave us a lunch coupon of $150 which we could use at there restaurant. It was really sweet of them to realise there mistake and compensate for same.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",24-Aug-15,5
Very Clean. Fast Check-in and Check-out Process. Great Amenities. They were able to get transportation around the city and to and from the city very promptly. Fast free wifi. Keurig available in the rooms.,24-Aug-15,5
"The views from the floor-to-ceiling windows on the 20th floor were really amazing. Room was otherwise nice, clean, pretty standard. Some very loud Euro-visitors one night at 3 AM -- I guess they were jet-lagged, but they were pretty darned loud even for daytime. The lot and street adjacent to the hotel has construction going on, which a cabbie told us has been going on for years -- I'm glad we turned in the rental car when we got there are didn't try to drive, it's a mess.",23-Aug-15,4
"The hotel was very clean and great location. Room was a bit small for 5 star hotel. Staff extremely helpful knowledgeable, specialty concierge staff who assisted with directions, transport and booking rent a car. the hotel also arranged to take the rent a car back for us. Awesome . Hotel had free pop corn and drink in lobby each day. Room was also great",23-Aug-15,4
"The hotel is adjacent to Union Square and the whole of the city centre is within walking distance. Chinatown is 5 mins away and Fisherman's Wharf is 25 mins walk.The underground and the famous cable cars are only 5 mins walk. The underground (Bart) provides easy access to the airport and is recommended.The hotel is very clean and modern and meets any high level of expectations.The views across the city are excellent, particularly in the evening.",23-Aug-15,5
We stayed there for a day earlier this year coming from some other city and before catching the flight. It was a very nice stay. The staff are very professional of course and friendly. The breakfast was good. Out room wasn't closer to the top of the hotel but still the views were nice. Some essentials are not automatically in the room and you have to ask for them. But they were delivered promptly when we asked. The location is very nice. Lots to do around and convenient for doing all the touristic stuff.,21-Aug-15,4
"Location, staff, room, bed were ALL great. Only thing that could had been better was more comfortable chairs in the room, both were hard and stiff, couldn't relax in them. Beds were great, staff was awesome and friendly, rooms were clean. Location was great and centrally located. This part of the MINIMUM 200 Character Survey I don't agree with.",20-Aug-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt SF is quite nice and the rooms comfortable, if small. Check in was easy and although check out was very crowded, one of the staff was actually paying attention and dealt with our requirements to store our luggage. Amazing attention in this day and age of non-customer service!",19-Aug-15,5
Always enjoy the hotel and pleasant staff here. Great location near Union Square. Perfect for a quick get away. Rooms are always clean and beds are really comfortable. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt.,19-Aug-15,5
"Full disclosure -- this was my first time to SF, so I can't compare the Grand Hyatt to any other hotels in the city. That being said, my room (king bed) was fine. Clean and comfortable. Some of the features are odd for the sake of being odd. WiFi was pretty good. Many commenters have noted the great location and they're right -- Union Square is a fantastic spot if you're a tourist (walk to Chinatown, AT&T Park, Ferry Building, etc.). If you're into shopping I imagine Union Square is the place to be. A few specific notes:- Parking. Valet parking is around $60. There is a public parking lot (the Sutter-Stockton garage) just across the intersection to the northeast from the GH for <$40/day. I used the lot for four days and it was clean and convenient. Traffic and parking in SF -- and Union Square, especially -- are such a mess that I didn't really want to drive anywhere. Almost anyplace I couldn't walk (with the exception of Muir Woods), I took a cab/Uber because I didn't want to deal with finding parking. The Sutter-Stockton lot worked well for me (with no additional inconvenience) and saved us some money. - Construction. Other commenters have noted the construction (someone is apparently tunnelling to the center of the earth). If you're in a room on a low floor you WILL hear construction noise late at night and early in the morning. I have no status at Hyatt and requested a standard king room (didn't pay for an upper floor). They gave me a 10th floor room (relatively low) and earplugs were a help (earplugs are provided in your room). Certainly not a criticism of the hotel, but it is something to consider.- The TV/cable package and interface is a mess. I would kill for a hotel to offer a regular cable package with a regular remote that works like a regular television. Watch a movie on your laptop instead. Overall, the GH is fine and I would probably stay there again (assuming it was cost competitive). It's hard to say there's ""value"" given the price, but it's SF and the price of most hotels are seemingly out of whack. I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from staying at the Grand Hyatt.",18-Aug-15,4
"Lots to like about the hotel. Everything is clean and in working order. The elevators are fast without a long wait usually. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean. In addition, Wifi worked well, there were lots of outlets, and staff was quick to respond to requests. On the downside, rooms are small and the floor to ceiling - wall to wall window takes a little getting used to. There was a motorized shade, with 3 different panels so you could block the direct sunlight which helped. The hotel is amazingly quiet for such a large hotel. Self parking is $41 a night and across the street with unlimited in/out. Plenty of really good restaurants in the area within walking distance. Public transportation is easily available and the concierge will advise you on the best way to accomplish your travel goals.",18-Aug-15,5
"Horrible waste of a stay, I should have stay elsewhere. Staff was rude and lacking of service for a Grand Hyatt. I have had and did have better service a Hyatt Regency or regular Hyatt. This is a poor representation of the Hyatt family. I wouldn't stay here again.",18-Aug-15,2
"My experience at the Grand Hyatt, was filled with errors and all we got was lip service. Still waiting for a gift and its been a week. Be firm and when quoted a price ensure they honor the rate and the room agreed upon.",18-Aug-15,2
"Location is the best feature about this hotel - I found it old and in need of some serious renovations - I stayed it here a couple of times (which is hard because it's highly demanded) and the rooms I got needed some serious renovations, felt run down and unattractive. Below par for a Grand Hyatt.",17-Aug-15,3
"Outstanding all around. Great friendly staff, excellent food, spacious rooms, great views, awesome location. Hardly ever have a problem with Hyatt stays. Doormen unusually friendly as is the maid service",17-Aug-15,5
"I had a great time at this hotel in which we got there with our children at midnight and the night manager truly took great care of us and he facilitated our connected rooms and they send a bottle of red wine to the room for my Wife and I , Breakfast was lovely at the club room and the internet service was very adequate , I can only say thank you for a great 5 days stay at the Hayatt , Will use the same hotel again for sure",17-Aug-15,5
"I expected more from a Grand Hyatt. This perhaps is low on their scale of hotels. Very basic and nothing special about it. Clunky elevators and tired rooms. I had to ask the housekeeping personnel to come and clean the bathroom when I checked in. Apparently, only clean towels and amenities were put there. At least I hope they were clean. Personnel was responsive, so that was good. I hate the smell of urine.",17-Aug-15,3
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is always my first choice downtown. Centrally located, GREAT staff, OneUP all make it an easy choice. I come the San Francisco a couple times a month and when available I love this property. perfect business hotel. Walking distance to most everything, good restaurant and lounge in the hotel and the staff understands the business traveler. Easy in and out, always a cab and great meeting rooms.",17-Aug-15,5
"The hotel is very conveniently located next to Union Square and Chinatown. It delivers exactly what one would expect form a big modern hotel. The room was good and the service good. Being so central to the city, it is expensive so if I was in San Francisco on a budget I'd most likely stay elsewhere.",17-Aug-15,4
Good location @ the heart of union square. Fast Wi-Fi. Very comfortable bed & pillows. Coffee facilities & equipments in the room. Quite noisy because of the construction behind the building. Don't prefer the rooms overlooking union square. ,16-Aug-15,4
I stayed in the GH on a recent visit to San Francisco. I was there on business and it was my first time in the City. First impressions of the hotel: it's very busy/ very touristy/ great location/ nice rooms. Detailed impressions: The hotel is located at Union Square which is very convenient as there are department stores all around the square plus quite a few restaurants and cafes. I've never stayed in a hotel like the GH before. It's very busy and almost feels like an airport terminal at times. My room was nice but I wouldn't say that it was 'warm and inviting'. Most amenities aren't in your room when you get there but they provide you with a list of the things you can ask for from room service (free of charge). One night when I came back to my room after meetings all evening my room had not been cleaned. By this time it was 10pm and I had brought take out to eat. When I called down to the reception they were very apologetic and said they could send me fresh towels. After hearing how annoyed I was they agreed to send someone up to clean my room but needed me to vacate my room for 45 mins. Annoyed and hungry I told them I would go down to the restaurant and they agreed not to charge me for the dinner. Dinner at the hotel restaurant was surprisingly great. I had a fish stew and it cheered me up. Overall my experience at the GH was ok. I wouldn't say it was bad (they rectified the room cleaning issue straight away) but the hotel lacks the inviting feeling you want when you come back to your hotel after a day of meetings. It does the job and I might stay there again.,16-Aug-15,4
"Centrally located by Union Square. Short walk to Chinatown and close to cable car going to Fisherman's Wharf.Nice hotel, friendly staff and decent bar. Good lunch at reasonable prices. Clean good size rooms.Recommended. ",16-Aug-15,4

"Outstanding service, beautiful rooms, extremely comfortable beds, attentive staff. Perfect in every way. We stayed at the Marriott Suites as well during the same trip and had beds that were hard as a rock and HVAC that blows directly on you all night.

"Big room nice bathroom, great view clean and a double size bed with a very good quality mattress. Good price for a king room with bay view. The staff very polite and always available to help. Very close to downtown. Waking distance to Union Square and Chinatown. What else you need to have a great stay? Very good choice . ",15-Aug-15,5
"We enjoyed a top floor suite with fabulous views over the city. the suite was amazing with great space, luxurious bathroom and very comfortable bed.The club floor does get busy but the breakfast and evening service is very welcoming, so it's not surprising that it attracts a lot of guests. Location couldn't be better for us as tourists on this visit to SF. The open top buses go from the opposite corner of Union Square and you are perfectly placed for jumping onto both the cable car lines. (catch the cars one or two stops up from the turn arounds - as they never fill the cars there for this reason). You can walk to all the major shops, Chinatown and Little Italy.Service was outstanding - every one we encountered was friendly and couldn't do enough for us. We were made to feel valued and appreciated. The only slight negative is that the windows do let in a fair bit of city noise, even when closed. Though on the plus side, the windows can be opened which is rare these days.",15-Aug-15,5
"This is a great base beside Union Sq for San Fran. We were welcomed by a very nice receptionist who could not have been more helpful and throughout the service was excellent. The Concierge were very knowledgeable and efficient in booking restaurants(try 54 Mint - an excellent new Italian 10 minutes walk away). Rooms were well appointed, nice decor with very good bathrooms and comfortable beds. Breakfast menu was good. Only issue was it was very busy during the summer season and the lifts were slow. Also be aware there is a lot of construction around Union Sq which is noisy so go for a high room.",15-Aug-15,5
This Hyatt is exceptional. Front desk was extremely accommodating. The staff in the Club lounge were exceptional and the food/beverage choices were fantastic. Everything fresh and abundant. Even at peak times everything was stocked and tables and eating areas were clean and welcoming. Kat at the front desk was so very accommodating too. She was happy to help me with my floor requests and treated me as if she had known me all my life.,14-Aug-15,5
"My fiancÃ© and I came to the beautiful city of San Francisco with two of our friends for a couples vacation. We stayed at the Lavish,Trendy Grand Hyatt Union Square. When we arrive we were surprise to see different conception of the front desk,We loved it.We received help from a agent by the name of Samaj. Samaj was very helpful and friendly. He offered us bottled water and Give us room upgrade. He also offered for us to call down ask for him personally if we had any discrepancies or problems with our room. Can you say Five star service? The room he put us in was beautiful,very clean and had a great view of the City. But what really made Samaj a Super Star was, when the Conicerge desk was closed. He give us great recommendations of thing to do in the city and see. He Also Made restaurant reservations for us. Which really made our trip easy and rememberable. He sent us to the Press Club and a restaurant called Blue Sterm. We're they Treat us like VIPS. My fiancÃ© jokingly said he must have called in a big favor for us. We had a great time and was able to meet other young couples. Also he recommend we go to 1300 Fillmore for Sunday Brunch and It was delicious. For a great surprise they had live Jazz. I recommend any young couple or anybody who want to be in the know about San Francisco or its nightlife to talk to this Guy. The only negative thing about the hotel was the construction near the hotel. But We will definely becoming back to the Grand Hyatt, next time we come to San Francisco.",13-Aug-15,5
"the bellman were rude, never smiled, and seemed like they did not want to be bothered. they lost our luggage and did not seem concerned, they counted number of pieces of luggage, even though one had someone else's name on it. instead of being embarrased, they made it seem like it was our problem.",13-Aug-15,3
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt for five nights while visiting a conference at the Moscone Center. It is clearly within walking distance to Moscone and to the city center. At the time there was however a lot of construction work at the streets nearby that made it a little bit cumbersome. The staff was helpful, the room clean and the size of the room was clearly enough for me. The safety locker in the room was not big enough for my laptop but this is a common problem at most hotels. Although there was earplugs available in the room it was very silent and I could not hear anything from the streets.At Grand Hyatt you can go up to the top flor to watch the view over San Fransisco Bay. I took the elevator every morning and night. The first morning there was bad weather and there was not much to see. The other mornings I was met with a sign stating that the viewing area was closed for a private cermeny but when I glimpsed round the corner there was nothing happening or being prepared. So for some reason the viewing area was closed most of the time I spent at Grand Hyatt.",13-Aug-15,4
Nice hotel. Rooms were great. Employees very helpful. We stayed here two nights and went to two Giants games. We walked to and from the night game on Friday. It is about a 25 minute walk. We felt safe walking because this is a good area of San Francisco. Saturday we took a cab because one was waiting at the curb when we left the motel. I believe the fare was $8 before tip. We didn't eat or use room service at the hotel.There is construction going on next door which made the street very congested trying to get to the valet parking area in front of hotel but it was a Friday afternoon and San Francisco was very busy to try to get around.It is a new building going in next door so construction is going to last for quite a while.,12-Aug-15,4
"We had a great stay! The hotel itself was very clean and updated. The staff was amazing. Especially Ann and David that work on the club level. We will stay here every time we go back to SFO because of them. The location is also close to Union Square, Mall and all public trans stations.",11-Aug-15,5
"Hotel was perfectly located, staff was exceptional in every way and room was extremely quiet and well appointed. As a lifetime Marriott Rewards member this hotel got an A+, Will defintely stay here again! Only tiny negative was valet/Bellman. We pulled up to check in and they just stared at us which made us believe we were in the wrong area to park, so we had to ask them.",11-Aug-15,5
"We stayed here for 4 nights on our way home from Hawaii. Hotel is located just off Union square a block or two away from Market street, trolley buses and cable cars. Room was modern and well appointed, great view of Downtown and part of the Bay from the 22nd floor. Concierge were very helpful and staff provided great service ",10-Aug-15,5
"From beginning to end, this hotel did not disappoint. I was very impressed by the customer service, from check-in to departure, including serving staff, bellmen, etc. The hotel is in a central location to a number of restaurants and shopping.",10-Aug-15,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt recently when attending a large convention at the convention center. The hotel is well taken care of, the rooms and all public spaces were very clean, the staff was great, the meeting space and food and beverage at the hotel were top notch. The large amount of construction going on outside the hotel makes for a surpricing early morning wake up! Take advantage of the ear plugs that are provided! But, an overall great experience.",10-Aug-15,5
"The hotel, staff, and area were all exceptional. I highly recommend staying here. It is located right on Union Square, where you can find lots of shopping and dining options. The overall feel of the hotel was luxurious. The fitness center was nice and had a great view of San Francisco.",9-Aug-15,5
"I decided to try the Hyatt because of its location in San Francisco, really near Union Square. It turned out to be a disappointment. The location is good, but the hotel feels like a train station. Lots of people in and out. The check in desk is not a real desk, the lobby is weird too. The rooms are okay, but the mini bar comes empty. I ordered two small bottles of water and it took almost 20 minutes to get them and the hotel charge was $21dollars. For almost $300 a night, I would say there was very little value for money. Definitely one to avoid. ",8-Aug-15,3
"An excellent business hotel that was easy to use and very friendly. Located within walking distance of the business district and good access to the bay front area with its restaurants and stores. Service within the hotel was excellent, with very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are tastefully designed and provide all you need for your stay. Online check out was qui and simple and saved time on the morning of departure.",8-Aug-15,4
"Great hotel, great location, rooms were clean, diamond club staff were friendly, concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful with suggestions and directions (maps), bellmen were fantastic and always there day or night to welcome me and open the doors!",8-Aug-15,5
Although the hotel has been remodeled you still get the smoke smell in the rooms from years of use. Rooms are comfortable and clean. People are friendly but expect about 30 to 40 minutes for luggage delivery. Didn't appear to be a real busy day as we walked right up to front desk.$56 for valet parking which was much more the others. Location is great but there are others that are better value for equivalent or slightly more money. ,7-Aug-15,3
"The hotel is superbly located on Union Square. Everything in SF is close or can be easily reached, either by walking or using public transportation. Staff at the GH was friendly and forthcoming, really making life easier. Modern room, a bit on the smallish side as to be expected in a major city. We, a family of three, coped quite well though. The gym on the 35th floor offered stunning views and got really busy during the morning rush. Equipment could be a bit better maintained -- showing some wear and tear, nothing what attention to detail could not cure.",6-Aug-15,5
"Located just across from Niketown, on Union Square, this hotel has a nice bar and restaurant, and pleasant rooms. We had two double beds with comfortable beds/bedding, and a view to other rooftops. The higher level bayside rooms have spectacular views, but can be more costly. The union square side views are nice too, but currently have large construction noise and may impede future views. We'd definitely stay again, really enjoyable stay.",6-Aug-15,4
Our room was on the 26th floor overlooking the financial district. The room was spectacular and has modern finishing with remote control blinds that you could control from your bed. The lobby is beautiful and they serve free popcorn and limonade in the afternoon and the staff from the front desks to the doorman were always smiling and very helpful. I highly recommend this place the only thing is their is no pool.,5-Aug-15,5
This hotel is in a great location on Union Square. The rooms are small and quite compact as most are in SF but nice. Bathroom is good size and recently redone. View is great (we were on 25th floor). The fitness room has an amazing view on 35th floor.,5-Aug-15,4
The GH is conveniently located to all major shopping centers. Easy to get around. Staff is very knowledgeable and offered great advise. The room service is excellent and worthwhile. My room was left spotless when cleaning occured. I definetly reccomend staying at the Hyatt,5-Aug-15,5
Bathroom shower head is poorly designed and just annoying to use. The air conditioning in the room just doesn't cool the room. The wifi is spotty. Room service tray was in the hall all day long even after I called to advise them to pick it up. I did like ordering room service on the television. ,4-Aug-15,3
"We had 2 rooms in this hotel for a week. The service was good, the housekeeping was very good, and the location was fantastic. Walked to wharf, AT&T park, restaurants all over town. This hotel was very reasonable for all that it offered!",4-Aug-15,5
We stayed 2 nights in room 2019. It had a great view of Union Square with bay in distance. The room was very clean and the staff were all very nice and helpful. The concierge was very patient helping us with directions to different attractions and how to take public transportation in great details. Our departure flight was in the late night. They stored our luggages after we check-out so that we could go out to do our sightseeing until it was time to go to airport.The Stockton Street next the hotel was under major construction. Traffic was very chaotic. Although our room was on the 20th floor we still could hear traffic outside. One night some people were protesting in front of Macy's across Union Square. We could hear the noise very clearly.,4-Aug-15,4
"Traveled with a great friend to celebrate being cancer free. I was excited to be in the heart of the city and enjoy all the at SF has to offer. I poured over reviews and even though I tend towards Hilton (bc of my rewards card), the Grand Hyatt stood out. We were so impressed that this busy huge hotel made us feel so welcome. The concierge was extremely helpful with all of our questions and setting up a rental car for us to tour Napa for a day. (They work with Enterprise and the car will be dropped to the valet for you and that is where you can return it, VERY EASY!) Housekeeping was excellent as well. The ultimate experience for us was that front desk agent Steve N. took note of what I was celebrating and upon returning to our room the first night, he had some items to help us celebrate waiting for us. SO thoughtful! Everyone we came in contact with was extremely helpful and personable. Location is excellent, right in the heart of it all...steps from everything. Uber helped us cover more ground when needed. While I love being in the busy city, the noise might bother some. Jackhammering began at 5:30am the first morning. Ear plugs provided though and black out windows helped us sleep in. Room service was awesome, fast too. The only thing the room was missing were robes. We loved having the coffee maker and fridge...loved the views. The beds and pillows were really really nice. I love down pillows and I slept so well. The lounge was were we started out each evening. Drinks were great, decent pricing on all and the live music was very fun. Bartenders know there stuff but the servers didn't really engage much. Overall, I would select this hotel again and because of their employees being so welcoming and helpful (Steve is awesome in my book) I'll be selecting more Hyatts for future trips.",4-Aug-15,5
"I have stayed here for business many times, but this time it was all family. It's so close to everything whether walking, taking a cable car or grabbing a ride with a cab/rideshare. Hotel rooms are recently remodeled. Very nice and comfortable. the beds are so wonderful that you find yourself wanting to stay in the room instead of going out into the city. The only downside is traffic if you are driving in. This is Union Square and the center point of shopping. So many places to dine, see and/or buy from.",4-Aug-15,5
"Only valet at this hotel for what I believe is $80/night. Across the street there is a parking lot for $60/night, outrageous. The hotel room, had so much dust, that I ended up with bronchitis. The hotel uses a ""menu"" for necessities, which you might have forgotten. But be ready to wait about 1 hour to receive it. Ok hotel, but pricey.The location is great, restaurants and stores all around, and close to China Town.",3-Aug-15,3
"20 people in line to check in when we arrived, with two people handling the traffic. Hotel is OK, but with poor room design and VERY loud due to tons of construction outside. We noticed two sets of ear plugs when we got to the room, which should have told us something. Service was lousy, but maybe that is just San Francisco. Wouldn't stay there again.",3-Aug-15,3
"Excellent quality and Service! Great staff! extremely helpfull, great service in OneUp restaurant! Speedy check in with four or more computer check in stationd, Great Concierge service, very helpful front desk",3-Aug-15,5
"Exactly what one would expect from GH; perfectly located on Union Square, well equipped with very good rooms excellent views. Club lounge worth upgrading too as excellent with great food and drinks and a superb view of SF harbour. Best thing about this Hyatt ? The staff, from an excellent seemeless check in to brilliant club lounge, superb Concierge services, great doormen who high five my 8yr old every time she went through. you may pay more to stay in in SF, but I doubt you will get as much value as here. Stay.",3-Aug-15,5
"Very nice hotel. Well located. Though could use elevators directed to specific blocks of floors to cut down on long waits in lobbies.Cannot say enough nice things about the staff; esp. the concierges Elizabeth, Joanna and Elaine. Always helpful, patient and polite. And with excellent up-to-date information about San Fran. Housekeeping was very good too. An area where problems can occur in even the best lodgings. We've worked in hotels ourselves and know where to look for issues. The Grand Hyatt Union Square had almost none and we recommend it.Now about the cable cars... if you enjoy standing in line for an hour watching while gov't employee operators take their leisurely union breaks... go for it.",2-Aug-15,4
"I wouldn't stay here again. It wasn't the worst ever, and honestly most of my complaints have to do with the room design. The service has been fine. The walls are so thin that I actually heard my neighbor peeing. Like, not just the toilet flushing, but the actual urine going into the toilet. Gross. Also, the bathroom was really big, yet there was only 1 sink, and no towel rods! The clean bath towels were hung on the handicap rail next to the toilet, which I found completely disgusting. ",2-Aug-15,3
"Grand Hyatt's have that name for a reason. Besides having a great location, every staff member is courteous and friendly and couldn't be any more helpful except for one of the concierge staff.We had a great room with a view of the GG Bridge.",2-Aug-15,5
"I often come and stay at Grand Hyatt in San Francisco for my business trips cause Its one of my fav place in town. The staff is super professional and kind, rooms are large, clean and the position is strategic. The breakfast is amazing with fresh fruits, pastries and the food in general is really really good. The bar is cool as well and there is also a fitness center with a stunning view on San Francisco. The wifi connection is powerful and its free. The concierge service is one of the best in town. I cant wait to be back at the Grand Hyatt. AD",2-Aug-15,5
"View of Union Square and street level current construction. Ear plugs added as toiletries are needed as single pane windows don't muffle noise regardless of floor level. Convenient to Macy's, Victoria Secret, Johnston Murphy, tiffanys, and more. Rooms have been updated but corners cut. ",1-Aug-15,4
"This was a perfect location for a very comfortable named brand hotel with all the right amenities; fridge in room, coffee maker, great bathroom amenities and wonderful service 24 hrs a day. The bellman, concierge and check in front desk agents were very knowledgable and helpful.",1-Aug-15,5
"This is a wonderful San Francisco hotel. The location is ideal and is in easy walking distance to major attractions. We stay on the 32nd floor with access to the special private lounge there. It's wonderful. Many breakfast choices in the morning, snacks throughout the day, and an elaborate happy hour selection are available to guests. There's a great view of the city toward the Bay as you enjoy the wonderful pampering of David as he makes sure that everyone's needs are met. The room itself is large, well appointed, and meticulously maintained. This has been our hotel of choice for many years when we head to San Francisco. It's well worth the price and travel.",1-Aug-15,5
"This is a great location for wandering around San Francisco. If you've stayed in Grand Hyatt's before you know what you're going to getâ€_a comfortable room, a seemingly safe environment, concierge, etc. There seems to be lots of parking to go around and we were happy to find a garage kitty corner from the hotel that offered special spaces for motorcycles. This is in the heart of the city, lots of shopping, restaurants, taverns, a short distance from Chinatown, the Embarcadero, North Beach, etc. and great walking access to MOMA and other entertainment.",31-Jul-15,4
It was a nice stay and the location was fanstastic. The room had nothing in it but there was a list you were able to ask for a lot of opptions free even hair brush. The restaurant was really god for dinner but the breakfast wasnt really something spacial and if you go out you will find perfect places nearby for breakfast. The staff were lovely and helpful and made my stay pleasent. you dont need to wait for taxi because there is always a taxi waiting outside and the people at the door will help you any time with anything. Public transport is near and there are a lot of shops around. But as there are a lot of contractingwork around the hotel you cannot sleep well and it is always noisy.,31-Jul-15,4
"My husband and I stayed here during my husband's business trip on July 28, 2015. While the hotel accommodated an early check in, the quality and cleanliness of the room left a lot to be desired. The desk was dirty and the bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned (hair on floor and pink mold on tiles around bathtub). Although this was bad enough, a previous guest had urinated under the vanity! I discovered this when I came back to the room after using the gym and pulled out the vanity chair! Although housekeeping immedietly came to the room to address the problem, I requested our room be changed. Ben from the front desk was helpful and courteous. He moved our room to a higher floor and gave us access to the Club Room. I am stunned that a hotel that charges over $350 a night does not have quality assurance methods in place to guarentee guests have clean rooms!",30-Jul-15,2
"Just traveled to San Francisco with two friends. We had a fabulous time staying at the Grand Hyatt. The staff took very good care of us. There was a tray of cheese, and bottle of wine sent to our room upon check-in. Anything we asked for from housecleaning was brought, or left in our room. The beds were super soft, and we were never disturbed by outside noises. We stayed on the 32 floor and had an amazing view of San Francisco. We were part of the Grand Club, and ate breakfast, etc., overlooking Alcatraz. The Grand Club experience makes me want to find other Hyatt's to stay at in the future. Wonderful food and service, 3 times a day. It saved us a lot of money. Would highly recommend staying here!!",30-Jul-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt is centrally located near Union Square. We got a high floor with a view towards the East Bay. The room was spacious and had great amenities. There was an arm chair with an ottoman, a long desk for working, a makeup dresser and makeup mirror, a modern bathroom and great decor. The staff were very friendly and helpful, though the person at the reception desk did get confused about a couple of things. The only reason I'm not giving this hotel 5 stars is because the floor of the bathtub was springy. It was some type of plastic which gave way a little when one stands on it. In all my travels I have never encountered a bathtub floor like that; it was completely out of character with all the modern fixtures. In fact, the sink was so modern that it was hard for me to get my large hands under the water. In any event, the only real drawback was the strange bathtub floor. The hotel has a lot of amenities. Since this was a business trip, however, I did not have time to avail myself of those amenities. I definitely would recommend this hotel for business people, tourists and for couples looking for a romantic getaway.",29-Jul-15,4
The room was fantastic money's worth people are warmth Cardinal and courteous the location was more suitable for us since we were going for Alaskan cruise and the pier for departure was very close. We were extremely satisfied and it's really good for people going on cruise like us,29-Jul-15,5
"While this is a great middle of the road hotel we were there for a work conference and had little to no internet. We tried to use the wi-fi and it didn't reach into the conference rooms, we tried the purchased wi-fi and had the same issue. Also, our rooms were very warm, we had maintenance look at them and they told us the air conditioning was working properly. Otherwise, again, this was a nice central location to shopping and while it was a long walk it was a very interesting walk to the Pier. Concierge here is FABULOUS and extremely helpful!!!",29-Jul-15,3
"No complaints,Good locationCleaning crew excellentLobby is pleasant and welcomingValet was forthcoming about cheaper parking across the street, maybe they were full.Concierge Joanna is phenomenal, an incredible asset: Recommended the perfect walking tour, the perfect restaurants both in San Francisco and Napa including where to park near said restaurants, how to get to the Giants game an back. She provbably raised my rating from four stars to five.",29-Jul-15,5
No water or beverages of any kind in rooms. Nothing in mini bar. Small beverage cart downstairs opened after I left in the morning and before I got back in the afternoon. No coffee available when I woke up. No turn down service. No food menus in the room (forced to use poorly designed on screen prompts to order room service). Food in the restaurant was mediocre at best. Basically if you are used to staying in a top hotel that provides ammenities and service that makes your trip easier this is not the hotel for you. I will not be staying here on my next San Francisco trip.,28-Jul-15,1
"I've stayed many times in this hotel and have alway found it to be acceptable - nothing special, not too grand - with a good location. But on this stay I noticed just how paper thin the walls seems to be. It was as if the jet-lagged family next door was in my room with me. I don't blame the family - but it seems the hotel has had issues with noise because the only amenity provided in the room (apart from soap and shampoo) was earplugs. Of course the hotel provides many amenities upon request. But it was telling that they go ahead and provide earplugs in the rooms without request. The location is of course great, but there are many many hotels I n the area. I will be choosing a different one on my next sf visit. ",28-Jul-15,2
"Great clean well located hotel. The rooms are practical and upscale. I really enjoyed my first experience with the Grand Hyatt brand. Will absolutely consider staying again on my next visit to beautiful San Francisco. Had a great view all the way to the water, so ask for a high floor room. ",28-Jul-15,4
We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF for a few days. We were very impressed with the service of the staff and the rooms as well. The rooms are very spacious and have great bathrooms. I especially liked the motorized window shades!,28-Jul-15,5
I love to stay here each time I stay in San Francisco. The rooms are very nice and the staff is great. It's right across From the park. There is great shopping near by and even better restaurants. You will enjoy it as much as i do.,27-Jul-15,5
"Modern rooms, delicious breakfast, centrally located in Union Square, friendly and helpful staff. Overall, wonderful place to stay for families. Front desk was great at providing detailed directions on how to use the cable car and Muni to get to all destinations.",27-Jul-15,5
While the room and stay were average the fact that we were there for a business meeting and could not connect to internet ANYWHERE in the hotel was quite a problem! Otherwise it was a comfortable room and a nice view.,27-Jul-15,3
The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is a fantastic hotel. It is located just a few blocks from Union Square. The hotel is clean and the rooms are tastefully decorated. The breakfast buffet was excellent and service was outstanding.,26-Jul-15,5
"I spent three nights here last week and it's a great mid-city location from which to explore the rest. The room was good (but not great.) I was lucky to have a full wall window from which to enjoy the view out over the city and Bay in the distance, which was great for watching the world go by.The bathroom was lovely and the vanity table was a lovely touch.Big comfy bed and choice of pillows.A couple of less good points:The Union Square location is noisy. Plus there was construction work almost all night - past midnight and it started again around 5am. Ear plugs were provided...There was a fridge but no mini bar stocked. Not even a bottle of water was provided. Room service is only until 11pm. Apparently there are water stations on each floor, however there is no hotel information provided to tell you this.TV channel choice is awful. I didn't even turn it on after the first evening.It's not particularly good value in relation to many other cities, however it seems that hotels just ate pricey in San Francisco so this is a neutral point rather than negative against the hotel.Would I return? Yes, definitely, depending on the rate available. Good for business travellers and solo travellers like myself.",26-Jul-15,4
"Very modern hotel, very business oriented, good gym. Very much like any other Hyatt. The service at check-in is great, but I felt that the concierge was rather annoyed of me (most likely because he gets the same questions all day long). My room was full of long, black hair in the bathroom, but also in my bed linen, so Ihad to get everything changed twice! The location is very central, but not much to do after work hours. Wifi is included in the price!",26-Jul-15,4
The hotel is spectacular! It is adjacent to Union Square which puts you within walking distance to many other places to explore. And if you don't like walking then all kinds of taxis and other public transportation is immediately available. You will love the hotels rooms and restaurant / bar. Typically I avoid buffets like the plague but their breakfast buffet in OneUp Restaurant was an exception. The food is excellent. The only drawback is that the 35th floor workout facility is tight and cramped. But once on a treadmill you are looking out into the cityscape and there is never a bad view. And speaking of views you have to go to the 36th floor!On this level you can see the city and bay from a 360 degree vantage point. There are comfortable sofas on the side that allows you the perfect view of the sun setting. This floor was a highlight of our visit.,26-Jul-15,5
"Visited here for business recently. This hotel is in a prime location if you have multiple meetings around the city as it is quite central. Checkin was fast, although the lobby checkin area is a bit odd and confusing (as in there is really no front desk, just a bunch of workstations). As a Diamond member in the Hyatt program, I was upgraded to a nice suite on floor 23. The room was very nice, but I would say the furniture was designed for style not comfort (unless you want to sit ramrod straight on a sofa). The room was noisy because of the way the wind hit the building (perhaps this is why they provided ear plugs in the bathroom). The bed could use an upgrade (overly soft and worn). All in all, this is a good business hotel, and I would stay again.",26-Jul-15,4
I've stayed in this hotel for 2 straight years now..both times for business trips. The best part of the hotel is perhaps the location. Right now marred by construction but nothing beats the proximity to Union Square. The check-in process was quick and easy although I was disappointed that some of the things I had requested for before booking weren't taken care of. For ex: I'm not a coffee or english breakfast tea drinker and had requested for those to be swapped with green tea.. didn't happen. Please be aware that some rooms have higher construction noise than others. Tip: A hot water kettle is available on request.,26-Jul-15,4
The Grand Hyatt in SF was in a great location and close to many shops as well as China Town. The room we had looked out toward the Financial District and we loved the floor to ceiling windows. The movie prices on the TV were ridiculously high.,26-Jul-15,5
"Great central location. Incredibly convenient for shopping. Get a higher floor for spectacular views...if you are an East Coaster, coffee service starts early...take a walk to Chinatown to see the sights at dawn and no crowds!",25-Jul-15,5
"I enjoyed my stay at the Grand Hyatt during my short business trip. My room was very clean, and the furniture was nice (modern). I stayed on a higher floor, so I had a great view of the city. Also, the location was great as it was pretty close to the financial district and Union Square, which was great for shopping. Lastly, the service was great.Cons: The front desk area seemed a little unorganized. It always took a minute for one of the front desk employees to help me, which I think was due to the physical organization of the desks (scattered and not all in a row). Also, my room was near a storage closet, so I could hear people accessing it at night.",25-Jul-15,4
"It is truly right next to the Union Square. But the down side is that there is a construction site right next to the hotel. Construction work lasted the whole night the first night of our 4 day stay there. That was bad.The hotel got some renovation recently. Not super nicely done, but does not look old any more. The suite we booked is quite nice and reasonably spacious. Service is good. We requested a roller bed of our daughter and the delivery was timely.As it is also close to the China town, it is a plus for us Chinese tourists to grab a bite there. Would recommend this hotel.",25-Jul-15,4
"Got the ""bonus"" room upgrade for a very reasonable $39, but our room faced construction. Also, couldn't seem to get HVAC fan onto low setting. Thank goodness for earplugs. Bed was super comfortable, and we slept well. Very nice business touches such as reading lights next to the bed, lots of outlets to charge our electronics, and a/v plus VGA plug-ins on the multi-swivel HD LCD tv. FREE WI-FI!!! Yeah! ""Interesting"" decor...kinda retro late 50's/60's but very tasteful and clean. Wife LOVED private vanity area. Parking Tip: avoid $60+ valet unless you need in/out & park across street in public lot for half the price of valet.",23-Jul-15,4
"The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco has great accomodations, great views, great staff and great location. Our stay was terrific in every aspect of the trip. we will definitely pick this hotel our next time in SF.",23-Jul-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful hotel... but there are a few things that really bugged me.... the arrival was a disaster as there is no driveway so there were 6-8 cars stacked alongside the road, not enough hotel valets and not a great way to start our stay at this hotel. The hotel does not have a gift shop or store that you can purchase snacks etc... The check in was also much to be desired. We arrived after 2pm and only 2 of our 4 rooms were ready....but what made it worse is that they supposedly put a rush on our rooms...well check in time came and went and we were never notified of our rooms being ready. Normally this would be ok, but we had a ton of stuff traveling with a big group.. I just didnt feel that we received the Hyatt standard in any way shape or form when it came to service. The only bright light in this whole thing was the bellman ray who graciously shuttled all of our luggage and instruments from room to room as our rooms became available... he was working overtime to get all of us settled. Everything else was great... clean, nice rooms etc. Great location. The wifi isn't very good ...slow at best. Not sure if I would choose to stay here again.",23-Jul-15,3
One of my best stays in San Fran despite the construction. If your looking for a nice comfortable place this is it. I was there for 5 days and the club floor is one of the best I have been to in a while.,20-Jul-15,5
"The hotel is located just at Union Square - a cool area for shopping and dining - and just about a 15 minute walk to the Embarcadero/Ferry Building. Every convenience is located within a block or two of the hotel. The staff is professional and friendly. The hotel is very modern and clean - their checkin and checkout processes were entirely done on my iPhone - super easy! And the price was great, considering it is SF.",20-Jul-15,5
"This is a fantastic property - first class customer service from the moment I entered until the moment I left. The hotel is lovely and relaxing with a unbeatable location (I've been to SF many times but this was my first stay in Union Square). I stayed in a bay view king room and it was well worth the extra. I was on a high floor with a dazzling view of the Coit Tower and the Bay. Room was spacious and extremely comfortable (great mattress), plenty of storage, nice bath, refrigerator, and bedside controls for the shades on the floor-to-ceiling windows. Housekeeping was immaculate. Yes, there is construction on the south side of the hotel - my room faced the north and I didn't hear a thing. I didn't hear my neighbors or the people upstairs either - very good sound proofing made for restful nights. I had drinks and snacks in the OneUp Lounge several nights - Linda was my server and took great care of me. Room service was prompt and delicious. The entire experience was on of pampered relaxation. I can't imagine staying anywhere else and I can't wait to return.",19-Jul-15,5
"Very good location and staff! We had a beautiful room on the 35th floor with an amazing view!. We were happy to discover a very affordable weekend rate. The hotel is close to Chinatown, but a bit a walk to the wharf. I would recommend this hotel to friends traveling to the area.",19-Jul-15,4
"The hotel is located in Union Square. Perfect location for exploring San Francisco. There is lots of construction going on around the hotel (they are building a subway extension), but we did not have any noise or dust issues in our room, or at the bar inside the hotel.We ordered late night room service. The order was not correct, however the kitchen and room service staff not only corrected the order, but removed that portion from the bill.The front desk staff are some of the friendliest and nicest people I've encountered on my many trips around the globe. Lyle was amazing. He went above and beyond to make sure my family and I had a wonderful experience. I can not say enough kind words about him. Thank you!My only issue is the lack of curtains or blinds. They have odd window coverings that do not block out the morning sun, waking us all up much earlier than we'd have liked.",18-Jul-15,5
"Great stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco despite the construction that is currently going-on to add to the hotel. Exceptionally clean room, from the floors to the linens. A special thank you to Ms. Ava He, who kept my room tidy and clean, to Guadalupe in the restaurant who waited on me each morning with a friendly smile and a glass of juice, and to Mark Herihy the Concierge who provided us with recommendations, reservations, and the best way in which to get there - thank all of you very much!",18-Jul-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt is a fantastic business hotel. A lot of the hotels near Union Square - Moscone Center are old buildings that have been rehabbed. Although they have ""character"", the problem with these places is that many of them are really noisy, and have poor internet, and no desk to work. The Grand Hyatt is a the opposite end of the scale - the rooms have comfortable beds, have a great work space and the internet connection was 5 bars. Right now (July, 2015), there's subway construction during the day in Union Square so there was some noise during the day, but the hotel was still reasonably quiet. The staff is really helpful, and the location is convenient since you can walk to Moscone in about 10 minutes. Excellent gym, on high floor, with fantastic views. Highly Recommended.",18-Jul-15,4
"Stayed here for 4 nights last week. Great location at the heart of union square, very convenient for shopping and many restaurants nearby. Close to cable car and local muni bus station. Room is nicely refurbished with new bathroom and rather modern interior. Automatic blinds control and good cable channels. Most importantly it's clean and house keeping is up to the Hyatt standard. We had the high floor grand club king which has great view and access to the well run grand club. Definitely recommended for first time SF visitors.",17-Jul-15,5
The services are up to standard and I enjoyed staying upper floors to see the beautiful bay view. The night view of Coit Tower is spectacular. The breakfast in the restaurant is delicious. I felt warm in the lobby with the open fire.,16-Jul-15,5
"I visited last month on business and stayed here. The rooms were spacious, with a work station and just another chair and table for relaxing. It also has a dressing room area, with a mirror and plug points, table and then a bathroom (shower within the tub). The rooms has blinds on it but there is no obvious way to operate it so you have to call reception to ask. They told me they always get calls about it. If you are reading this, the button to adjust the blinds are located on headboard of the bed, near the phones. The sleep was very comfortable! Bed is huge.I can't comment on breakfast as the host company had their own thing for us on the top floor, not linked to hotel. It's located at Union Square and there is a lot of construction taking place. But location wise, just up the road from the Apple store and other major retailers.But overall a good hotel. Recommended.",16-Jul-15,5
This indeed is a beautiful hotel as are a lot of San Francisco hotels. I think the next time I am there I would be tempted to try another hotel to see what is available. The location is excellent and the beds are very comfortable. The room was fairly quiet. The bathroom is lovely. It was expensive but that is to be expected in San Francisco.,15-Jul-15,5
"For someone who has travelled extensively for business and pleasure, i am likely to change my travel preferences to another hotel. the room was terrible and there was no lobby bathroom and as someone who spends a lot of money, i would expect to be able to check out on time and use the club both before and after i check out. this was not the case.",15-Jul-15,3
"This hotel is in a perfect location near the BART/Muni system, and near the trolleys to access Fisherman's Wharf easily. Short walk to Chinatown. The rooms are nice and so are the staff. We really enjoyed our stay!! We would definitely stay here again!",15-Jul-15,5
"We spent 4 nights at this hotel. Excellent service, great breakfast at the Club Lounge. Nicely renovated rooms and great shower. Location is great and donÂ´t miss the city view from the top floor.Highly recommend this hotel.",14-Jul-15,5
"Stayed here 3-12 July. Fast no nonsense check in check out service. The rooms are decently decorated. 5 mins walk to Chinatown entrance, also a five minutes walk to the Union Square, which is the starting point for Hop on Hop off tour bus of SF. A lot of dining places within 5-10 mins walk. I tried Loris Diner and Scala's Bistro which is good. The only setback right now is that there is a construction that works all the way into the night right in between the hotel and Union Square. Deafening until mid nite.",14-Jul-15,4
It was our 1st time in San Francisco. The location & great hospitality of the hotel made our stay very comfortable. The breakfast staff at the One Up Restaurant was very friendly & attentive. Mark in Concierge gave great suggestions re: nearby restaurants.,14-Jul-15,5
"I had a very delightful stay at the Grand Hyatt - SF. I would recommend for business meetings or personal time. While construction was going on nearby, it was hardly noticeable in the evening. Loved the popcorn and lemonade on Friday.",14-Jul-15,5
"Great place in the middle of everything. The weekend was pretty quiet but during the week, there was noise from the construction workers at the time we stayed at the hotel. I would still stay there again.",13-Jul-15,4
"The property merits five stars. Rooms are large and comfortable, and well appointed. Work desk is roomy, with plenty of outlets and connections for any computer. Rooms contain a safe. Bathrooms are large, and with plenty of surface on the sink for toiletries. Bed is comfortable, easy chair and desk chair also comfortable. So why is it not a five? Elevator-to-room ratio is not good, resulting in long waits for elevator. More than once a phone call to concierge or front desk resulted in 12-15 rings with no answer. Approximately $5 for every 15 minutes of internet usage seems high. No pool (but there is a gym). The staff is helpful and personable. Overall, a very nice experience (rooms bigger and more comfortable than the nearby St. Francis), but one that could have been even better.",12-Jul-15,4
"Stayed for 3 nights on business recently. Check in line was long and understaffed, but use of the kiosk was easy even for the first time and check in and key was quick. This is a large hotel with an excellent location for all san fran activities.There seemed to be a 50/50 mix of biz travelers and tourists.The rooms were nicely sized with all necessary amenities. Surprisingly quite room, though once construction started around 8 it was impossible not to notice.Did not try the restaurants or bars but within walking distance is great food and drink.",12-Jul-15,4
"Loved the hotel!!!! the rooms are great and the location is magnificent, wich is good in san francisco, close to good restaurants and the staff was great. The restaurant is good and the consierge was so helpful and knew his job",12-Jul-15,5
"We had a wonderful time here. The location is great, right next to Union Square. It is easy to access public transportation from nearby Powell Street and saw the entire city. The hotel is beautiful and comfortable. The concierge staff is wonderful, so get a map and dining suggestions upon arrival. The entrance to China town is only a couple of blocks away.",12-Jul-15,5
"This hotel would have been a 4 if not for the construction noise. Room was spacious for the city and they seemed to have a good stock of rooms with two beds. It wasn't spotless but not dingy either, so I can give the benefit of the doubt on a few crusty surfaces. The bed was way too soft and saggy, like sleeping in a basket. Decor was updated but had a lot of golden wood so it didn't feel as sleek and modern as Hyatt Regency and Andaz locations I've stayed in.But the construction noise was a huge intrusion. Immediately to the south of the hotel is a new Apple office building with a 24-hour work permit, but during our stay that site only worked days. However, the city has a 24-hour work permit on the street itself, and they did their loudest work starting promptly at 12:30 a.m. each weeknight. It wasn't standard jackhammering, more like a piledriver, incredibly loud. The hotel provides the yellow 3M earplugs that are thick and stiff, not at all comfortable to wear all night. Definitely bring your own better quality earplugs (the orange and purple ones from Lowes are good) if you plan to stay here in the next several months. Unfortunately the loudest part of the noise is intermittent, a few times an hour, so it's not a steady din that you can get used to. During the second hour of noise I called down and was told the only thing they could do was move us to the other side of the hotel, which I did not want to do at 1:30 a.m. The desk employee also said that my side of the hotel was usually the quiet side, which seems impossible given that I could see two work sites and there didn't appear to be any on the other sides. Quite disappointing not to be warned about the noise when booking. Marriott is always good about warning about hotel renovations even when they have only a minor effect on the stay, and this was much worse than any renovation.",11-Jul-15,3
"the rooms are small, but the views of the city from the higher floors were cool. The continental breakfast was excellent. The reception people were friendly, but the concierge staff was surprisingly unhelpful. Our keys weren't properly activated at first and there was a long line at the reception desk so we approached the concierge who told us we needed to go to reception, saying 'I can't do anything about the keys'. Maybe so, but it would have been nicer if he had walked us over or just been a little more friendly. nothing really bad to say about the hotel, but for the price I expected something more luxurious and accommodating,",11-Jul-15,3
I have returned to stay at this fabulous hotel for the third time. This is one of my favorite Hyatt hotels in the U.S. I like this hotel because of its location and the flexibility of their staff. I have asked for a 3pm check out and the front desk agreed without the slightest hesitation. They did this even though their hotel seems to be very busy. The doorman at this hotel is also very friendly and will go out of their way to assist you. I will continue to stay at this hotel whenever I visit SF and will not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.,11-Jul-15,5
"When we made the reservation, we requested a quiet room. When we checked, I reiterated the request and the individual who checked us in checked his book and said that we were assigned a quiet room on a top floor that was very quiet. Within seconds of going to bed, it sounded like a helicopter was landing in the bathroom. When we called downstairs a sheepish voice told us that we were facing Union Square where there is a massive construction project for a subway--and that the construction company has a permit to work 24 hours a day. We were then given a room on the opposite side of the hotel. Ashley helped us move and what an impressive employee she is. If it were not for her assistance and the friendliness of the doorman (Paul) I would have had one star in my rating rather than two. The front desk manager (Maria) phoned at one stage to offer her apology with an insincere, scripted hope that we would have a nice stay. All in all, for the money we will monitor the construction project and avoid Union Square on future trips until things are back to normal.",10-Jul-15,2
"We stayed for 4 nights. Loved it and sure would come back. Location at Union Square is great, near to shopping, major attractions, restaurants. Hotel is in a very good condition. Looks very well kept. Service was excellent at check in and overall. Concierge service very helpful. Room has good size and is comfortable. Beds are too soft. Gym on floor 35 has a great view of the city.",9-Jul-15,5
"my husband and I took a trip to SF over 4th of July wkend. booked it thru hotel.com for $279/nt w/ city view. they upgraded our room to higher floor when we arrived without us even asking. city view is great view and our room had remote control shade in very large wall to wall window which was cool. they also had complimentary beverages (strawberry lemonade and blueberry lemonade) with popcorn in lobby for 4th. rooms are modern and clean and bathrooms are not too small, very comfortable size compared to other boutique hotels in SF (this is my 4th trip). wifi was free. when we asked for toothpaste, they supplied. but best part of this hotel is its location. we decided against fairmont hotel because it was farther away from center/union sq, fairmont is closer to china town and up on a hill. the hills are very annoying to walk up day after day. some of the other boutique hotels (such as klimpton ones) are actually located a bit farther down near touristy area near shopping malls on market street, its close, couple of blocks from GH. Market Street is crowded, noisy and there are a lot of street peddlers and homeless people. its not even a trendy part of town. GH was by far not the most reasonably priced hotel but for the money, service, size of room and bathrm and location, it was perfect. there was construction right by the hotel but it didn't bother us. there is convenience store half a block away for your water bottles and snacks and starbucks across the street as well as mini starbucks in lobby every morn. we walked to fisherman's wharf (2mi) but hilly. we walked to financial district, soma area, china town, pier 39 where there were no sea lions (they leave for the summer), and pier 14 where some restaurants are. riding the street cable car is not practical in holiday wend, sometimes there is 3hr wait. walking is what most people end up doing. but one thing we missed out on was the alcatraz tour. they have dinner tour which is extra spooky but we got shut out to every tour. it gets booked over 8wks in advance. some of popular restaurants get booked 8wks in advance too, so plan ahead if this is part of your trip. for the fireworks, GH has top floor, 36th where you have view of the fireworks by the pier/fishermans' wharf towards GG Bridge part of town. rooms are not what I would describe as ""Luxurious"" but in terms of what you get and where, it was 5 stars for us.",9-Jul-15,5
"I Stayed at Grand Hyatt for four nights from 15th June onwards. I was expecting a bit more from the hotel. Its a good hotel dont get me wrong with good location as its very close to Union Square and i paid around 480 $ per night including breakfast which was just too much. The rooms were small (i expected a bit bigger), bathroom is small too. The service was good and not Great . I was disappointed by the breakfast at level one the cafe as i was expecting a Luxirious Buffet breakfast but there was hardly anything to choose from not even a egg station .To make it short. Its at a very good location. The hotel is good if not great. Rooms are small , breakfast is ok. A bit too pricey i would say. I got fooled by trip advisor reviews, its Over Hyped .",9-Jul-15,4
"As a Hyatt rewards client and an avid business traveler, I have come to expect high standards for any Hyatt, but especially a Grand Hyatt.Pros:- service was excellent- bellman were quick and welcoming- front desk assisted in changing your room quickly and without hesitation.Cons:- I was checked into I believe a ""stale"" room. It smelled musty and had a fishy odor.- there was dust everywhere.- the sink filled up and wasn't draining.- there was no robe or slippers.- the headboard was all wood and beat up and scratched.- the bed actually squeaked.- the whole room was filthy.I called the front desk and moved me right away and the next room was much better, had just been cleaned, and had a robe and slippers indicating it was recently refreshed.- it was still dusty and the headboards need to be changed out as they look banged up. Something ,ore sure is required for a headboard.- the bar and room service had God quality beverages and food.- I love the location as its next to Union Square and all the shops surrounding the hotel. I'm hoping management reviews and escalates up to remodel the rooms as they need to be done.",9-Jul-15,3
The hotel is very centrally located at Union Square. We stayed for 4 nights. There are lots of nice bars and restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel and China Town is only a 5 min walk away. Fisherman's Wharf can easily be reached by food or public transport (bus stop is just across the street). Best to try to get a room with bay view as there is a construction site facing Union Square. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was great. ,8-Jul-15,4
"Admittedly it was a last minute booking at about 6pm but on arrival the receptionist was quite offhand and definitely needs some training. The room she gave us was on the first floor and when we asked for something higher, as my husband has a Hyatt card we hoped this would help, but she said it was the last room and when we asked again she said "" it's only for one night""! So we went to the room and were horrified. It was obviously originally a big corner room that they had simply divided in half. You could see that the front window went into next door, as did the wardrobe. The entryway was so narrow and it was a tiny room. We have stayed at many Hyatt hotels around the world and could not believe this room was part of the Hyatt chain, let alone the Grand Hyatt. I am sure a lot of the rooms were great but this one was pitiful. We rang down to speak to the Duty Manager, he wasn't very apologetic but we were moved to a room on the 4th floor( so the first room was not their last!!) which was somewhat better but still not worthy of the Grand Hyatt brand name. A month later we were talking to some friends about San Francisco, they complained about staying in a terrible room- yes, the same hotel - so it wasn't just our opinion.So be careful, as I said I'm sure there are some great rooms.",8-Jul-15,1
"It was the first time my parents visited the beautiful city of San Francisco. The location of the hotel was very close to Union Square, Market St, and Chinatown. The Pier was a good 15 minute walk from the hotel which is not bad at all (5 min using the trolleys). People were friendly and the room was nice as well as comfortable. ",7-Jul-15,4
Great hotel experience. Perfect location to walk to everything in the downtown core. The room on the 17th floor was great. Very comfortable beds and pillows. I can't say enough positive about the Concierge folks. They couldn't do enough for us and did everything with a smile. Highly recommend this place.,7-Jul-15,5
"Stayed there for two nights over July 4th weekend. I'm a diamond, so my review might be skewed in that regard. Used a suite upgrade for the two night stay and loved the room. The only complaint we had was the bed was too soft. It was a pillowtop that had seen it's better days. Don't like a soft bed at all. Otherwise the room was fantastic. Regency Club was staffed with excellent help; very friendly, too. Would most definitely recommend on our experience. Will return.",7-Jul-15,5
"As a frequent traveler - domestic and international - I realize that things happen - such is life. Additionally, it's almost instinctive to write and complain when something goes wrong. I try to write and compliment the establishment when something goes well and exceeds my expectations. The 4th of July visit was one such occasion when the staff at your SF location outdid themselves. From Julia at the Check-in to Adnan and Jason during the fogged out fireworks. Pedro at the bar and Stephanie (Operator) not to forget Nate and Philip and Maria. Well done folks! Well done!!",7-Jul-15,5
"The hotel is very new looking, rooms recently renovated. Had some issues with the house keeping accidentally taking 2 champagne flutes we brought back from Napa, but the management went above and beyond to alleviate the issue. Really great customer service. Our room had some slight creaking coming from the ceiling, I assume this must have just been a random occurrence for our room as I've never experienced this with a concrete build hotel before.. otherwise very quiet and really great views.",7-Jul-15,5
"Room was comfortable, but they have only two elevators that go to the restaurant and lounge and they seldom were in service during my stay. I ended up walking around the neighborhood to look for breakfast since I have a knee problem and stair access only was not comfortable for me.",6-Jul-15,4
"Strongly recommended to stay at this hotel when visit San Francisco. Great experience! We all enjoyed our 3 nights stay there. Great city view from our room. Central location, within walking distance to the shops and restaurants.",6-Jul-15,5
"Stayed at Grand Hyatt San Francisco for a work trip in April, 2015. My colleagues switched to the Gran Hyatt a few weeks before the trip because of the Hyatt Gold Passport point promotion that was going on. So glad we did! The property is about 30-40 minutes from the airport, and about $50 one way cab ride. I was upgraded to a room that overlooked Union Square/Macy's...loved it. The privacy blinds could be controlled by remote control and I loved the morning sun rises. I did not eat at the hotel, but from what I hear from my colleagues, the food was fantastic. I loved the location because it was in walking distance to pretty much everything we needed and to get to our office. Definitely a great work trip choice hotel. I would definitely consider staying for a personal trip as well.",6-Jul-15,5
"The ho0tel is located close to all major sightseeing attractions. The conference center and amenities were more than suitable for all 200+ attendees. Perfect for business and pleasure! Staff was helpful and friendly, the Gold Passport is a must.",6-Jul-15,5
"Our favorite hotel to stay in San Francisco for the excellent service and proximity to many key attractions. You often do not get the overwhelming crowded hotel experience in here, and the staff tend to be extra helpful and hospitable. The hotel has nice amenities and offers several dining options that are good. The views on high floors are terrific. There are many very good restaurant choices within few blocks.",5-Jul-15,4
The best part of this Hyatt is the staff. Everyone is exceptionally helpful. If you can stay on the club floor - it is well worth it. The club room has a great selection for breakfast and the afternoon hors d'oeuvres were delicious. You can make yourself your own cocktail and sit and relax with great views of the city. Our room was okay which is how I would rate the hotel itself. It is not up to the standards of other Grand Hyatts. The bar on the 2nd floor was okay but again missing the higher standard of a Grand Hyatt. We did not eat in the restaurant.,5-Jul-15,4
"Great hotel with very helpful staff, although a liitle on the expensive side. The Gym is on one of the top floors overlooking San Fran, a wondefrul way to work out. The location in Union Square is ideal within easy reach of the main shoping area and Market Street. I would certainly stay here again.",5-Jul-15,4
"I appreciated the gracious and helpful service, stylish decor, and a very quite and comfortable room (I now hate my own mattress and pillows after being spoiled here)! I look forward to staying here again in the future, since it was by far one of the most restful and customer-service oriented hotels I have stayed at so far.It is within close walking distance with Union Square, making it easy to access the cultural goings-on in the square as well as Asian Box, a 100% gluten free restaurant that made life easier for me as a traveler with celiac. :)",5-Jul-15,5
"The conference I speak at had changed venues and i was so glad they did. Although I was used to the other hotel and had been ogling there for several years, the Hyatt was a definite step up. The room was excellent and the food in the restaurant, as well as the catering for the conference, was very good. I'll be back.",4-Jul-15,4
Lots of mistakes on check in but i must say they seemed absolutely flat out with a big conference at the hotel. After a couple of complaints the front desk manager gave us Regency Club access and cut the room rate by half so cant really complain too much. Rooms are a bit dated but that is made up for by the location and great staff,4-Jul-15,2
"Very satisfied with the hotel in general and with the service. The room was pleasant and clean, and the staff responded immediately in replacing an iron and hair dryer that were not working properly. Concierge was very helpful in getting a dinner reservation at a great restaurant.",3-Jul-15,5
"My wife and I had a great experience staying at the Grand Hyatt for a conference and vacation. The room was nice and big. Just as important, the customer service was excellent. The people who checked us in and out were very helpful and handled a tricky checkout with ease.",3-Jul-15,5
"Good service, very comfortable beds, clean room, nice view, but the noise from the BART station construction outside our room was a real drag and woke us at 6:30 every morning (including Saturday and Sunday). Convenient location for the convention center, Chinatown, walks to the Ferry Building and lots of great restaurants.",3-Jul-15,4
"Rooms needs to be updated. We had a room in the third floor (stayed for a week), and it was not part apparently of the mayor update the hotel went through. Great service at the concierge. I asked to be moved to a better room...was not possible. Good -not great- breakfast.",2-Jul-15,4
I'm a diamond with Hyatt AND Hilton and I stayed at this property for 1 night in June. I was impressed with the quality of customer service; from the front desk to the doorman - everyone was helpful and kind. The room's view was GREAT - which I asked for - and the lounge was fantastic. I'm impressed - and that doesn't happen easily for me. I'm staying again this Friday (July 3) and hoping to see the same standard of service and room quality. Well done.,1-Jul-15,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Fran for 4 nights. Fantastic location right across from the Port of San Francisco. Close to Fiance District and public transport right outside your door. Beautiful hotel with great food and bars, reception area is outstanding. Staff are very friendly and helpful if you need to find your way anywhere. Great choice for accomodation in central San Francisco CBD.",1-Jul-15,5
"I just spent four nights at this centrally located hotel, and I highly recommend it. The room was immaculate, furnishings were in great condition, and staff was very friendly. My room had a terrific view of the city. While I was curious to see a package of ear plugs in the bathroom along with the hotel toiletries, I quickly understood when I heard the street level noise way up on the 25th floor. I appreciated the hotel staff offering the plugs. I would definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt to others. ",1-Jul-15,5
"I recently returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel, where there is construction going on directly next door (I was told an Apple Store was forthcoming) and the street directly in front of the hotel was also all tore up! So, needless to say, utter chaos reigned around the vicinity. The hotel itself was lovely. As soon as you walk in the doors, the hotel is an oasis of cool quiet. We did not eat at the hotel, but there was a restaurant on site. Our room was comfortable, clean, and well-attended. I was in town for a conference, and the conference center was a nice 10 or 15 minute walk away which was a definite plus. I would definitely stay here again, hopefully after the construction projects are finished!",1-Jul-15,4
"I stayed there for 4 nights. It's a 5 star hotel and I'm glad I got what I expected.Room was big and confy.It was centrally located few minutes away from convention site and shopping center,I left my iPhone in the hotel after checkout and I got it back.Breakfast buffet was awesome. Staff are nice.",1-Jul-15,5
Terrific staff which made me feel welcome and offered a free room upgrade. Also gave an excellent recommendation for breakfast. The hotel is in an excellent location with lots of shopping and restaurants close by. The hotel offers amazing panoramic views from the top floors. The interior design is modern contemporary.,1-Jul-15,5
"I stayed at the San Francisco Grand Hyatt while attending a conference at the Moscone Center. On the positive side, the location was convenient, and the staff were friendly and professional. However, the room was average, not luxurious. I was charged a conference rate, much lower than the advertised price, but I was still a bit disappointed. I know bed preferences are very subjective, but I found the bed and pillows uncomfortable, so I did not get much sleep during my trip. The mattress was lumpy and the pillows were squishy, not at all supportive. I would not choose this hotel in the future.",1-Jul-15,3
"perfectly located almost equidistant from the piers, Chinatown, arts district, and major downtown shopping areas. Million dollar views (assuming you are facing the bay), and uncluttered contemporary rooms.",1-Jul-15,4
"I spent 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt on Stockton St. Rooms were very nice . . . simple and modern. Very clean and comfortable. I was on the 18th floor with a view across Union Square. There's a lot of construction going on in San Francisco so you do hear quite a bit of noise. No fault of the hotel. The location is great for walking around, shopping, dining, and going to the convention center. It's 5 blocks to the Powell St. BART station which I took to and from the Oakland airport. Chinatown is a few blocks away. I had a room with two double beds. The only complaint I had is that there's no water in the room. A few bottles of water would have made it perfect. I like the Hyatt brand and I'm rarely ever disappointed. This was no exception. I didn't try the restaurant or bar. The lobby area is quite nice and self check-in was quick. Staff is friendly and the doorman are pleasant. I would definitely stay there again.",30-Jun-15,4
"A friend and I came for a few days of shopping and hanging out. The hotel is located right off Union Square. It is a fairly central location, excellent if you are looking for big name stores. Not very close to boutique style shops and eatery. Hotel was clean and room was updated. Small complaint would be that they did not change the windows when they renovated so there is a lot of noise coming from the street. We were",30-Jun-15,4
Excellent hotel. Great view from 20+ floors. Love the l9unge on the 25th floor. At $30 per person breakfast is a wonderful value and selection. Rooms are very comfortable and quiet. Try and check in as early as possible to get the besf available rooms. I highly recommend bay view above 20th floor. Overall A+,30-Jun-15,5
"This hotel has it all given that it is a very nice hotel and it is located on Union Square so a lot of shopping and site seeing is literally outside the door. It has been renovated during the past few years so the hotel is very contemporary in design and every feature of the room fits the theme. In addition to being in the right place with very nice accommodations, our interactions with the staff were all very good and they seemed to make sure we were happy. Given we were there on a busy weekend, this is not an easy thing to accomplish so I can highly recommend the hotel. Larry",30-Jun-15,4
"I've actually stayed at this Hyatt a number of times over the years and it's provided consistent high quality service every time. The rooms are comfortable, they're not havens of modernity but everything is there that you would hope is there. All the staff are great from the front desk, concierge & valets all the way to the cleaners.The lobby has been updated in the last few years and is inviting but it's not massive, in fact the hotel has quite a small footprint so the elevators take up a lot of space in the middle. There's a restaurant and bar on the mezzanine level and I must say that I preferred the restaurant on the top floor where you'd get a great view in the morning, but it's still ok.Location is awesome though, I think you could be in Union square in 100 steps (I didn't count) but you're on the quieter side of the square away from the noise and general hubbub of Powell St.",30-Jun-15,4
Poorly trained staff! Very bad layout of reception! Has to clue about the Hyatt Members or recognizing them. Rooms are way too small - no matter what room you get its nowhere near the Grand Hyatt in the middle east for example! Grand club was very disappointing at this facility Room was next to a pantry and the noise just messed my entire weekend - could not sleep properly as the banging woke me up each day around 6 am!,29-Jun-15,2
"The location was the reason why I stayed. You would expect all the good things about a Hyatt and the hotel delivers them. Ask for a room at a higher floor to enjoy the view, I had a room at 16th floor and didn't see a thing. Breakfast room is small and crowded, I had to wait 10 minutes to get a table.Cool stuff for kids, they had in the lobby free popcorn and lemonades.",28-Jun-15,3
"When we first drove up to the hotel, we were not sure if it was the front or back entrance because no one came to greet us until a minute later. The check-in process was fairly easy and the man who guided us to our room was very very courteous and brought us extra towels and tips on shopping and where to get the best views all without asking. The room is very updated and modern and the hotel wifi is fast too. The check-out process was a little more unnerving as the man who checked us out did not bother with any formalities and seemed like he was just trying to get us out of there. All in all, a great experience up until the very end.",26-Jun-15,4
"I changed my reservation from an inferior hotel to the Gran Hyatt SF during my business trip and was very pleased. Excellent location and amenities. Hotel is modern, clean, and has outstanding service. Very happy that I moved hotels.",26-Jun-15,5
"This hotel is in the middle of everything San Francisco. It's clean, modern and the staff is friendly & helpfull. No negative complaints. I recomend this hotel & would stay there again. I was traveling with my family (2 kids) they loved the hotel as well. Hyatt Rocks!!",26-Jun-15,5
"I stayed here to four nights. I am very satisfied with the location of the hotel, the super clean room, and very impressive view from room. The dinning at OneUp restaurant is a pleasant. The fitness center is in the 35 floor, it was pleasant experience exercising while facing beautiful city view.",26-Jun-15,5
"Great location, a walk away from all the shops and department stores around union square. A little bit more of a walk but did it most days, to Fisherman's wharf through China town, took about 30 minutes. Lovely clean, modern rooms and comfy beds! Also has a good size gym. Friendly staff. Would stay here again.",26-Jun-15,4
Beautiful hotel! So close to shopping and great food! Had a great time with coworkers in the bar and great food in the restaurant on 2nd floor. Amazing views from the top floor. I was able to see Alcatraz and all the way around the city. The room I stayed in was a really nice size with a huge bathroom and was really trendy. ,25-Jun-15,5
"A bit shy on elevators at busy times, the Grand Hyatt is nicely refurbished and the staff is responsive. Close to SF Union Square it is centrally located for mid-town shopping and sightseeing. Getting to the wharf and piers is a bit of a schlep. A good choice for a SF first-timer.",25-Jun-15,4
"I found this to be the best deal in SF on hotels.com based on price, level and location, and was glad of the choice. 2 others in my party who usually stay at higher end were also pleasantly surprised. Package included 2 breakfasts (not just a continental, but a la carte or full buffet). internet and rooms. Bargain! The rooms are not huge, but nicely re-done, lobby, bar, front, hallways, rooms and bathrooms have all been renovated and look modern and sleek. The automatic shades are a nice touch, big TV's (no HBO sadly), nicely re-done bathrooms and closets. Service on the phone, requests, etc were taken care of quickly and efficiently - water, a robe, toothpaste, late checkout, etc. Breakfast is excellent for a hotel - dungeness crab omelette!! No extra charges. My two complaints would be 1. design of hallways which cannot be changed of course leaves several room doors meeting and you can hear if your neighbours are the boorish kind that talk outside their doors or bang around coming and going. 2. bath needs a spray to get rid of mildew, a bit of red mold growing between tilework in areas. If housecleaning were a little more careful about the baths, I would have very little to pick on in most hotels. great bar area on mezzanine - caffe on the ground and salt water taffee at the front desk!! You are right on Union square. every bit of shopping a block away and a Starbucks across the street (though in SF I think it is mandatory to have one every 2 blocks).",25-Jun-15,4
"The location of this Hyatt is right in the middle of one of San Francisco's jewel, Union Square. It's very clean, modern and the staff is very helpful Grab the highest floor possible as this location is very busy with cars and people. If you get a room high enough on the bay side, you'll see Alcatraz, the sail boats and Coit Tower. Dining is satisfying and the bar staff is wonderful. Got my own private whiskey/bourbon/scotch tasting. Top notch, world class hotel and staff.",24-Jun-15,4
I came to san fran to join my girlfriend for the weekend. she was in town for business and i came out to join her on thursday night. The staff here are amazing . the front desk staff were friendly and helped with all of our questions. this was my first trip to the bay area. The dorr men were all very friendly and helpful. I would recommend staying here the veiw from the 36th floor is very nice and you can see alcatraz form the viewing deck. The breakfast was always fresh and plentiful,24-Jun-15,5
Excellent hotel located in Union Square. Rooms were nicely appointed and staff was friendly. Valet parking was very expensive but convenient. Construction during stay provided early am wake-up calls. Nice lounge areas with hotel.,23-Jun-15,4
We've stayed overnight here many times when we come in for dinner and don't want to drive home after enjoying an evening in town. This hotel has been kept up nicely. Rooms are clean and bathroom has all the amenities you need. Although this time around no bathrobes a favorite of my wife's. We get a king with a view which is nice. The main attraction is location. Right across from Union Square. Nearby to all the shopping you need. Be aware that there is major construction going on adjacent the hotel and nearby Stockton Street. The noise is not a factor in the hotel but getting around the streets requires some maneuvering. Don't valet park it'll cost an arm and a leg. Use the nearby public lots on Geary or O'Farrell streets.,22-Jun-15,4
"Our family of 4 stayed at hotel for 2 nights during a sightseeing trip to San Francisco. The hotel service was outstanding, the rooms were well kept, and the upgraded ""Club Room"" service was very good. Would stay again.",22-Jun-15,5
"Most things went well, but I was shocked to wake up one morning -- struggling with jetlag -- to the sounds of drilling and pounding. Unbeknownst to me, staff at the check in counter had happily placed me right next to a construction site, without even giving me a heads up. The internet in the room also conked out on my third day, and I had the pleasure of staying on the phone with their technical support for a good 15 mins to troubleshoot the problem.",22-Jun-15,1
"If you have allergies, make sure you ask for their pure rooms. The rooms are fresh and clean and even the bath products are fragrance free, etc. Air freshener runs 24/7, you can turn it off if you like. I'm not a big fan of the sliding door on the bathroom, but otherwise it was quiet and clean.",21-Jun-15,4
"Stayed with our points to have dinner & attend a theater performance at the Orpheum--The Book of Mormon--very funny but crass. Very nice hotel with friendly staff & easy access to any where in San Francisco. We ate in the Lounge & OneUp dining room & found the food very good in each area. We did feel the parking fee was a little excessive, but we were able to take the car in & out without an additional charge. We will return.",20-Jun-15,5
ok - before I start - there is construction going on right next door - not that the hotel can control that but wanted any soon to be travelers to know this in advance as you do have to maneuver around this if you are walking around the area and it does get noisy beyond what I would consider normal San Fran noise. I had a room on the 30th floor - which was not my original room but as I arrived early due to a early AM flight - they were great to get me into a room early. I had a great view of Coit Tower and the TransAmerica building and being on a high floor the street noise was still there but a bit less(this is a city - like NY there is noise - they had ear plugs in the room if needed). The room was typical Hyatt furnishing - no complaints - here though is where they stray from General Hyatt - they people in both the restaurant and the lounge in OneUp were some of the nicest most genuine people I have meet working in a hotel - the gentleman in the Grand Club was also a dear man - this alone would have me coming back as well as the location.,19-Jun-15,4
"The Grand Hyatt was a wonderful hotel. We stayed there 4 nights and had a view of the city and bay with a king-sized bed. The room was kept very clean. Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The bathroom was large and water pressure was ok, but not outstanding. The shower curtain was a tad short and that created a lot of water on the floor after showering. The only problem we had was there was a lamp on the desk that wouldn't turn off and maintenance promptly took it but never returned with a new one. Since I needed the light, I had to call to receive a new one, which I did without a shade. The doormen were outstanding. We always had a cab within minutes. We were traveling with a large group for a wedding and everyone was pleased with their rooms and the general atmosphere. The location is within walking distance of all the shopping and one of the trolly stops, plus the bus tours are only a few minutes' walk to where they pick up and start the tour. Chinatown is a short walk away through a tunnel. I would stay there again. There is quite a bit of construction going on about a block away, but we didn't hear any of it in the hotel and it wasn't a problem walking on the sidewalks, either.",18-Jun-15,4
"Visited San Fran for a business trip and this was the perfect hotel. Close to the Moscone center as well as the shopping and attractions. Helpful staff, large rooms, clean and modern. The restaurant is good for breakfast, albeit a bit pricey, and has a nice bar area. Would recommend to a friend.",18-Jun-15,4
"What I love about the Hyatt SF is the location: its close to everything in downtown. And walking downtown is really a pleasurable experience. The other asset is the staff are very friendly and helpful, you truly feel at home.The reason for my low score is that the hotel isn't very user-friendly. Instead of providing the basic necessities that any decent hotel should provide; they ask you to call for shower caps, cotton buds, tooth paste, and the list goes on. The coffee machine is tucked in a cupboard that is not easily discoverable and no map to help you get around the room. The night blinds are not easily discoverable either. You need to call for everything. By the way, you also have to request for the electric kettle as its not a given.However what is most annoying is if you have parcels delivered to your room, the hotel charges $5.00 for every package. Considering how much you pay for the room, this should be service that the hotel can provide at no extra cost. And it doesn't matter whether you pick the parcel at the reception, you will still be charged. On the positive side, the hotel has a great gym on the 35th floor and it has a great view of SF. The hotel has lots of interesting events in the evening and this makes it a really cool, happening place!",17-Jun-15,3
The construction noise from union square ruined our sleep. The rooms are not constructed to handle any bit of extra sound. where its from the construction or the neighboring rooms. Rooms are very small aswell .,17-Jun-15,3
"My daughter and I stayed here for our quick trip to the city. We wanted to shop near Union Square, we were attending a show at the Orpheum, and we had an appt. near Sutter and VanNess so the location was perfect for us. We drove into the city and parked at the Sutter-Stockton garage which is basically across the street. We were parked there for about 19 or 20 hours and paid $27. Not too bad relative to other options.Check in was quick and easy. The lobby is very different from other hotel lobbies - there are a few people standing with laptops at small podiums ready to check you in (rather than one big long counter). Our room was on the 14th floor and faced west so we basically had a view of Sutter Street. We noticed a bit of street noise but it was not too bad - and we are used to complete silence at home.The room was very high-tech (at least in our minds). There was a shade that you could raise or lower via switches at the beds or at the door. The tv had internet access and the remote had a mouse / trackball like control.The bathroom was fairly spacious, although the design of the sink (one large trough-like basin on top of the counter) took up a lot of space so that there wasn't much counter space left and you still only have one sink - it would be nice to have EITHER a bit more counter space OR 2 sinks (or both). The shower was ok - I like a stronger water flow but it was adequate. The towels were a good size but a little thin in my opinion for this level of hotel.Both my daughter and I thought the beds (we had 2 doubles) were THE MOST COMFORTABLE we have ever slept in! We both wished we could have slept in and enjoyed the comfort! My one comment re: beds would be that I prefer to see queen beds rather than doubles.There was free internet access that was sufficient for our needs (basically checking email and using some basic apps). There were 2 other levels available for purchase ($5 or $10) but we did not need more than the basic level available.I did order room service after we returned from the show and it took about 30 minutes for it to arrive. I have really no experience with room service but the wait seemed reasonable and the food was good and quite warm.We didn't use any of the other hotel amenities although we did go and look at the fitness room. It was fairly big with lots of machines and had a great view of the city from its location on the 35th floor.",16-Jun-15,4
"You cannot ask for a nicer, friendlier hotel in Union Square. We had a wonderful view of the city, the buffet breakfast can't be beat, and everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. If you like to work out, what better way than overlooking the city!",16-Jun-15,5
"Service forms a big part of my impressions of hotels, so the Grand Hyatt was a terrible experience. It took housekeeping an hour to deliver a charger for my laptop, and when I called at the 30 minute mark the operator's response was ""I don't know what to tell you."" My $10 room service bill (for 5oz of ice cream, already a clear markup that I accept is part of hotel food everywhere) that I ordered through the Roomlinx system came with an additional $5 ""delivery charge"". When I called to find out what it was for, the room service staff said it would be on every room service order I made. This is my first time encountering such a system in years of travel. There are no basic toiletries in the bathroom, like a toothbrush or toothpaste (this too only came after waiting for 30 minutes). The rooms are big and the location convenient, but there are hotels around the area with similar facilities and much, much better service. This is really not the best you can do.",15-Jun-15,2
I was very happy to utilize the mobile check in and mobile key. It was great to enter and walk past the registration desk!! I had previously requested any free upgrades and was happy to be assigned the 32nd floor! We loved our room and would be happy to return. The room was small but had a great view and bed. The bathroom had a cute / funny sink that looked like a bathtub!!,15-Jun-15,5
"I stayed here three nights on business. The check-in experience could have been a little better - rather slow and a bit of a line. The room itself was great - large, comfortable bed with a big clean bathroom and a good view.Two complaints - the coffee machine made atrocious coffee; basically tasted like hot water. And I found it odd that the minibar fridge was empty - such a lost opportunity for the hotel to make some money!Shower Score: Average - Simplicity 5/5: Single knob to control everything; it was responsive and well- varies - Flow 3/5: This is perhaps the most important element of a good shower, but unfortunately this one was a little weak - Space: 4/5; Simple, in the tub",15-Jun-15,4
The hotel was overall lovely. The staff extremely accommodating. And the location couldn't have been better.... Walking distance to the Trolley. Walking distance to great shopping. Walking distance to Chnatown.,15-Jun-15,5
"I really enjoyed the stay in the Grand Hyatt while going to the Apple WWDC 2015, just as the years prior to that. Great service, location, hotel and views. Just what you want in SFO if you are there on business or leisure, with family or without.",15-Jun-15,5
"Stayed here for three nights. The hotel is very centrally located right in the heart of The City, near Union Square. Steps away from great shops, restaurants and attractions.The Bell staff and Front Desk were very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 31st floor with a beautiful view of Coit Tower and Bay Area. The room was rather spacious with two double beds, however, the beds are rather small for two adults to sleep on one bed. I think it would have been more comfortable to have stayed in a room with a King bed and a rollaway for my husband and I and our teenage son. The hotel provides you with earplugs, as the noise from the occasional honking horns and sirens can get a bit loud, especially late at night.The one area that needs improvement in is at the Concierge Desk. We were very disappointed with the staff there. We asked the Front Desk for help regarding visiting an attraction and they referred us to the Concierge, we went over to the desk and the person manning the desk was helping someone else regarding a lost wallet, which we understood and had no issue with but what bothered us is that the concierge, did not acknowledge us at all. She made no eye contact, and pretended not to see us. After the other guest left, the concierge immediately got on the phone and was trying to find the wallet, and not once did she look at us or say that she would be with us shortly. While still on the phone the other guest came back and said he found the wallet and the two of them proceeded to have a long conversation and we were completely ignored. We were disconcerted to say the least. We left and found out on our own what we needed to know. It was very disappointing for a hotel like Grand Hyatt to have their staff ignore their guests. To make matters worse, that wasn't the only negative encounter with the Concierge desk, later that evening, we wanted to get a recommendation for an eatery and asked one of the Bell Staff, well he referred us to the Concierge desk and we decided to give the desk another chance. Well, the woman earlier must have left for the day, as there were two gentlemen on the the phones sitting at the desk. One of them acknowledged us and said he would be with us shortly, but shortly was not the proper term as they both were on the phone for at least 10 mins. It was very frustrating, because I know that the one who acknowledged me was helping a customer over the phone in making dinner reservations, but I highly doubt that the other staff member who was also on the phone, was helping a guest, because he was on his cell phone and the desk phone simultaneously and it sounded like he was dealing with a personal issue. With the exception of the Concierge Desk, the rest of the staff at the hotel were professional, friendly and very accommodating, and we would not hesitate to stay here again.",14-Jun-15,4
"I am satisfied with all aspects of my stay. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Free wifi internet offered in the rooms was very fast. Room service was great. Whatever you need, you call them and they bring it to your room in few minutes. After staying in four different 5 star hotels in US, this hotel was the only one who offered a tea kettle in the room. I don't have anything to fault the hotel.",14-Jun-15,5
"This one is bordering on dropping out of classification, I think. It is reasonably clean and tidy. The fit out is a little dated and in some rooms tired. I tried a couple, for reasons I will come to in a minute. Bed is comfortable. It is a tourist hotel, some distance from the financial district, but convenient to the main shopping area, and appeared to be frequented by tour bus parties. There is not a good selection of restaurants and coffee close by.The rooms are incredibly sparse. No water, nothing in the fridge or cupboards, no paper (they have gone paperless and services are requested online through the TV/intranet). The only thing in the room were toiletries, towels, and an American style brew coffee machine. Free wifi speed is just above the threshold of pain.But the reason I won't be back follows. Readers who are easily offended should now stop reading.At about 11pm I was just contemplating turning in when I heard a noise. Other reviews have commented that it doesn't see well soundproofed. I heard a regular, high pitched ""owwrrr"" from the room next door. Usually these things don't go on for long, so I wasn't too troubled, but it persisted. Only to be replaced by a sort of ""mewwww"" that was also regular and high pitched. I admired the variation in style, but it was so persistent I stuck my head out my door, partly puzzled, and party intrigued. Only to have it stop and be replaced by a distinct ""yap"". At which point I realised there was actually a real dog in there. Extraordinary. Which promptly started to go off its nut with a full time barking episode. I rang switch and, in disbelief, asked if it was hotel policy to accept dogs. And was advised it was. Which means there is a statistical probability that a dog had lived in my room at some time. Sorry not on. I love dogs, but I am not staying a hotel which allows dogs to stay. It never even occured to me that a Hyatt might. New question now added to my travel list!!Anyway, back to the evening's entertainment. I explained to switch I had a problem. They sent security. A large, very pleasant man who sympathised, established there was no-one but the dog home and rang the manger. Who came, tried to contact the owners and then opened the door. Only to have the security guy attacked by a wizened rat like creature, which the owners had obviously (and fraudulently) been told was a ""dog"" because one of the sounds it could make was a ""yap"". The visual contrast as the rat attacked the physically imposing security guy was hilarious and a clear indicator of the rat's IQ.At which point the guys managed to herd the animal back indoor and shut it. Advising me that they would have to get the ""animal control officer"" up. You are joking...an ""animal control officer""????? I offered to control it permanently for free. But the offer was declined.After some little time they managed to find me a downgrade room to move to. While the rat yapped on....Bizarre.",14-Jun-15,2
"My room was amazing. Great views of San Fransisco and a comfortable bed. If you like working out, you will be very pleased with the gym here. It is on the 35th floor with an amazing view and excellent equipment.",14-Jun-15,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Union Square, San Francisco for 5 nights in June 2015. I have food intolerances and the hotel catered for this in most cases and they made it reasonably easy for me to have food for breakfast and evening meals. I have stayed here in 2013 for a similar amount of time and in a very similar room. This time however I was on the Union Square side and I found the rooms very noisy (not from the construction work outside - which I was told during checkin, but from the rooms surrounding). I even, ashamedly, called down to reception to ask them to deal with the noise at 1am (as this noise level was constant in the preceding nights and I couldn't deal with it for a third night in a row). The security dealt with it, which was good, however it started again the next night. I donâ€™t believe it was the fault of the other guests, more so, the lacking of soundproofing in the walls, something that is quite disappointing in such a high calibre hotel and for what the guests are paying!The hotel is very well situated with a Muni Bus (the easiest way of transportation around the city) right out the front (on the corner of Stockton and Sutter Streets). As well as being walking distance (without hills) to shops and Union Square and Bart (the train system)There is a wonderfully equipped gym (pictures attached) as well as a lovely set up of the breakfast and evening canapÃ©s in the Club Lounge (images attached). On the top level is a private area that you can view (if there are no functions being held) the landscape of the city. It would also be a fantastic location for any function you are wanting to hold (images attached)The staff from all departments were very friendly and helpful and it also helps that I have an extreme soft spot for San Francisco. If any readers would like to hear things that you really need to do during your time in San Fran please donâ€™t hesitate to get into contact with me â€“ Iâ€™ve done tourist things as well as ""off the beaten track"" walks and venture - I have photos of all I have done.",13-Jun-15,4
"Our stay has been really enjoyable. Customer service is top notch from housekeeping to the doorman. Rooms are nice and the bed is comfy. Our view of SF is awesome! Convenient to Union Square, steps away. Chinatown is also just a block away. The fitness center is nice and has everything you need to get a good workout in. We'd stay here again.",13-Jun-15,5
Its been the best place i have stayed at !! The well decorated and equipped rooms Great hopitality !! The ambience around the hotel is great ! Of the best corner was the fire place at the lobby to beat the cold outside. Union square being just a few steps away and ofcourse the shopping was easy to access ! Loved every bit of the stay!,13-Jun-15,5
"Since there are a lot of Filipinos who work there, it felt like home. Starbucks in the lobby is good but there is one right across the street as well. We dined there one evening but food wasn't that great. I would rather eat in Loris Deli, which is just a 2-3 minute walk. I would consider Marriott on my next visit just to do a comparison.",12-Jun-15,4
"Looking like a great cold building the inside is surprisingly cozy, I sat with friends in the lobby for hours just talking. The rooms were bright and sunny and dark when it was needed. Bathroom was modern and had all the necessities in it. Close to the Bart and surrounded by great shops.",11-Jun-15,5
Only stayed here 1 night prior to moving on to Fisherman's Wharf. Check-in was quick efficient and friendly (after having a bad journey through immigration at SFO)Our room was high and overlooked Union Square.Hotel furnishings were very nice and the only small complaint I had was the inter connecting door seemed thin and we had noisy neighbours.....but saying that we were only there 1 night so no major problem.A nice hotel in a good location.,10-Jun-15,4
We stayed 3 night at the Grand Hyatt and really liked the location next to the union square. We had a room on the 26 floor with a splendid view on the bay. The room it self is nice for a city travel or business stay. The doors do not close from the outside noise so you can hear pretty much everything eg when your neighbors are coming home late at night. And stay away from any room next to the ice machine if you do not want a all night noise. Besides this we liked the stay and slept really well in this hotel. ,10-Jun-15,4
"Before heading to the Hyatt I had seen great reviews and some negative feedback on the construction around the hotel and noise. It honestly didn't bug me a bit! The location of the hotel was fantastic, close to shopping and great restaurants. We had booked 3 rooms and stayed for 3 nights. Upon arrival, one of our rooms wasn't ready until after 6:30 pm due to a late check-out. We weren't too put out, as we had two other rooms to put our belongings in, but it did seem pretty late. The front desk staff sent up some wine and beers to our rooms for the inconvenience, which was nice. We had club level rooms, which was worth it. Access to continental breakfast (a good one, not just muffins and yogourt) made it worth it and also kept us up in the higher floors, so the view was spectacular. We had kept one extra room for an extra night so that we'd have somewhere to put all of our things until we left at 5:30 pm. With not getting our room until so late the first day, it would have been nice to have that credited - but whatever. I'd stay again simply due to how nice the hotel is and the location.",10-Jun-15,4
"We stayed there April 2015, the hotel is in great location but I wouldn't say it compares to other Grand Hyatt hotels, its not luxurious as other Hyatt I have been to, maybe it is for NA standards. Good location close to SF shopping area and all attractions accessible.",10-Jun-15,4
"We stayed for 4 nights in June, and as diamond members, used one of our suite upgrades during our stay. Overall a nice, clean hotel in a good location with friendly and helpful staff - you certainly would not go wrong staying here. However...It's just not what we had come to expect from a Grand Hyatt and there were a few annoyances that added a little frustration to our stay. The Grand Club is nice enough but the breakfast and dinner snack options are pretty limited compared to other Grands we've stayed in. Our Wifi connection was problematic throughout our stay which as I had to work a bit was frustrating. After I phoned tech support and was told it was my laptop, the front desk were very helpful and offered to send someone to look at it which was good but frustrating nonetheless. Since my laptop has travelled everywhere with us and we'd not had problems anywhere else, seemed odd it would suddenly be the laptop . Indeed on the Tuesday before we left it suddenly started working without any problems at all - Ho hum! Also, there are no express elevators to the higher floors which meant during busy periods it was taking 10 minutes or longer to get from our floor (29) to the lobby, or we would be waiting for an elevator for what felt like ages to go up to our room each time. Minor things but they add up and left us feeling a little underwhelmed rather than really satisfied which is how I normally walk away from a Hyatt stay feeling.",9-Jun-15,3
"Very nice hotel, location, and rooms. Just a little noisy right now with lots of construction next door and down the street. hfjksk hsdflkjhsdlk hklsjdfhsdlkjh hslkdjfslkj hsflksklj kljsdhfjklsdhfsjkdh lkjashdflkjds lkjsdhflkjsdhfjk kljshdfjkshdfh lkjhsdfkljhsadflkhj",9-Jun-15,5
"The room was large and comfortable. As I was on the 32nd floor, the view, too, was incredible. I have one small complaint - when I checked in, I had to wait for an hour for my room. During that time, I received no feedback from the staff as to my room's status. However, they compensated for the inconvenience (without me asking) by giving me access to the Grand Club during my entire stay. The restaurant, although recently moved to the second floor from the top of the hotel, was fantastic - great service and delicious food. The concierge service was exceptionally helpful.",7-Jun-15,5
"We selected this hotel due to the location on Union Square and it did not disappoint. But our stay was much more pleasant than expected because of our experience with the excellent and friendly staff at the hotel. Steve on the Reception desk was very friendly and made we two weary travelers feel right at home. Our room was lovely and well appointed. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel, from the people holding the doors in the lobby to the concierge who was so helpful and the staff at both the OneUp bar and OneUp restaurant were very pleasant to deal with. We had a very good experience in San Francisco and would cettainly stay here again on our next visit to San Francisco.",4-Jun-15,5
"Decent stay, good location, friendly staff. Hotel restaurant was a bit disappointing, maybe caught them on a bad night. Other eateries close by. Good location for shopping, and getting to know downtown San Francisco. Cabs right outside hotel.",3-Jun-15,4
"The hotel is clean, modern and comfortable. Quick check in/out and very good service. Very nice bar/restaurant to hang out. The rooms are spacious and the beds are fairly comfortable. I was hoping for a pool, but it did not have one.",3-Jun-15,5
"Excellent facilities, super friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are clean, quiet and modern. If you are able to have access to the Club lounge, it is a great relaxer. Staff there are the best in any club I have attended. Location is great to get to all the parts of SF you want to visit.",3-Jun-15,5
Love this hotel. Right off Union Square. Great for business also if you happen to like Christmas shopping in The City. Easy across the bridge to Emeryville / Oakland in case you are headed that way. Staff is excellent and super friendly.,3-Jun-15,5
"We stayed here 5/27. First off, the staff, EVERYONE, is absolutely AMAZING and helpful. They provided suggestions for site seeing, transportation and food. Unlike other hotels that charge $8 per bottled water, we had 6 brought to us for free. The hotel is literally in the heart of the city. We were a 5 min or less walk from Chinatown and a 2min walk to amazing shopping. Any direction you walk from the entrance, you'll end up somewhere amazing. Great shopping, farmers markets, places to eat...it's all accessible from the Hyatt ! We took a trolley ($6 all day pass ) down to the wharf. I highly recommend this! Great views, picture opportunities, and HELLO, you're in San Francisco! RIDE A TROLLEY!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because construction woke us up at 6am. Omg....lol. Our room faced Macy's, and although the view of Union Square and the bay are stunning, that construction was loud. Let me reiterate, the staff was Just lovely, from the valet to the bellhop to the front desk. Omg....almost forgot. You can even 'text' the hotel, and asked questions! We asked about bars and breakfast recommendations. They responded within 2min. How fun is that! We didn't eat there, but we did go to the bar for a drink. Great vibe to just relax and socialize. I included pics of our room view (2419) and a fun trolley pic!! ",2-Jun-15,4
"Well located in downtown San Francisco with only walking stroll to Macy, Disney store, Union Square and other shopping strip. It's also couple blocks away from Powell Street turntable and Westfield. The good thing is you don't see homeless around your hotels as homeless is part of SF community that you normally see around the town. Room is kinda small but expected for downtown hotels. If you ever forgot any amenities they have list of items that you can request to housekeeping, very long list! Sure that would meet all your needs!",2-Jun-15,5
"We chose The Grand Hyatt for our weekend getaway as it was perfectly located in between the theater, Book of Mormon, and the restaurant, Slanted Door. It's a well-maintained property with stunning views of the Bay and city. The proximity to Union Square was also a real bonus. I will stay here again when I return to the city.",2-Jun-15,5
"My opinion of the Grand Hyatt San Francisco... meh...I stayed for a night in a standard double and found it to be small and the bed to not be very comfortable. The amenities are average, the bathroom is average, the check-in experience was average.... you get the point.By far my biggest complaint with this hotel is the service. First off, don't put on your website as the first option for arriving from the airport a route by way of the BART. It's six blocks... uphill... from the nearest station. My father and I hoofed it with 6 pieces of luggage, arriving drenched in sweat. Just unacceptable to not provide proper information to paying customers. We would have gladly hired a car or paid for a taxi from the airport had we known it is in no way a walking distance with luggage. Just in case you think I'm over-reacting, the reaction from two front desk employees was ""You walked that with luggage!!!!"".Second, when I filed a complaint I asked that they please e-mail me once they've had time to discuss internally possibly putting a disclaimer on that ""transportation"" option. Of course I never received an e-mail, nor an apology.Just a disappointing experience. I originally had a reservation at the Hyatt Regency SFO, but changed it to the Grand Hyatt. I certainly regret that now.Low-end of the scale 4-star property in a 5-star location, with 3-star service. My recommendation would be to shop wisely.",1-Jun-15,3
"This hotel is situated nicely so you can access Chinatown, Union Square, the Moscone convention center, and other areas within minutes by foot. The modern feel and the great amenities were a welcome treat that I enjoyed while staying here on business. The higher floors (I stayed on the 23rd) offer scenic views of the bay (including coit tower, Alcatraz) and the sunset/sunrise was gorgeous. I would definitely stay here again.",31-May-15,4
"Hadn't stayed at this property in several years, but they've really upgraded the place. Rooms are spacious and have everything you'd need. Staff were friendly, welcoming and available. The coffee bar had fresh muffins and breakfast sandwiches which is always great.",31-May-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt has great staff that care about your stay. The rooms are updated with Hyatt class.The location is fantastic, just around the corner from union square.We walked to the theater and plenty of dining and shopping options. This location is safe and views of the bay are awesome.",30-May-15,5
"Excellent hotel with a new attitude to do business. There is not lobby by as soon as you get to the hotel you are greed with a person that makes your life easy. This hotel is used to test the new method and I can tell it worked for me. The hotel's instalations , the personnel and the rooms were fanastic. Great location, in downtown closed to all major transportation means, close to Chinatown and to all the major stores.",28-May-15,5
"If it wasn't the neighbors too loud at midnight to interrupt our sleep, it'd be a perfect trip. But everything else was great. The staff are excellent. Would stay there again. The location is where you want to be. You can walk to Chinatown. You can walk to a BART station. We even walked to Fisherman's Wharf. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around the area. It's everything you want on a vacation in the Bay Area.",27-May-15,5
"This hotel is 1 Block from Union Square, and 1 mile from AT&T ballpark, very busy location, lots of construction going on right now, lots of services and shopping nearby close to Embarcadero. Friendly hotel staff.Nice rooms,Will stay again.",27-May-15,4
"Location : Central, Macy's next door, 10 minute walk to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minute by taxi. Lobby : The interiors are not that great, there is definitely room for improvement. People : Very nice and accomodating staff ! from the bellman to the receptionist to the concierge, every one was warm and friendly and willing to help ! Food : We had room service, buffalo wings, it was excellent ! Beds : Very comfortable !Room : Cozy and Clean ! Bathroom : Typical hotel bathroom,nothing fancy but it was clean. The toiletries are not name-brands, but still good enough to use.Price : Reasonable considering you are smack right in the middle of everything",26-May-15,4
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in SF for two nights while on business. We were very happy with our stay, the room was very clean, and we will definitely make plans to return to this hotel in the near future. I was fascinated with the layout of the lobby, and I thought the artwork looked cool (see pictures). Also, the room was very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable, although I thought that the room could have used a bit more lighting. We ate at the restaurant OneUp a couple of times, and we met up with friends at the lounge in the evening. I admit that we were surprised to find that the food was excellent, especially since the restaurant was never crowded when we visited. The staff was friendly, and we enjoyed our food every time we visited. All in all, the hotel is in a great location downtown (Union Square), is close to lots of shopping and eateries, and the rooms are well-appointed. Thank you!",26-May-15,5
"Stayed here for the weekend. Great location just off Union Square. Central to almost everything. Staff is excellent, very attentive and responsive. Rooms are updated and very nice. Street construction on the Union Square side of the hotel was quite noisy. Would recommend asking for a room on another side of the hotel.",26-May-15,4
"From the moment we got there, Valet parking was on it although it's quite a feat to get curbside in the first place since the city is hustling and bustling. Check in was a breeze, the bell hop got our belongings quickly up to our room. The room was fantastic, we had a room on the 26th floor with Bay views which I probably enjoyed the most. Room service was prompt, food and drink were great! Felt a good sense of privacy too. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the water pressure in the shower. One Up Bar and Restaurant was excellent!! The location was also a big factor as it's right in the middle of the city.",26-May-15,5
"Our arrival was Filled with ""Hawaiian Hospitality"" Hugs of Welcome from Steven at the front desk just made our Day (traveled by by Van that morning from Eureka). Check-in was smooth; our luggage was promptly brought to our rooms by Ceaser (he was so helpful too.) Our Executive Suite was spectactular and jaw dropping. Mahalo Michael Jokovich the Best ever General Manager EVER!!!!( we miss you on Maui : ( The Grand Club Services were exceptional and gracious as ever. Manuel/Engineering took care of our requests and left us well taken cared of. Gina in the Executive Office is a priceles Gem! Mahalo for securing ""Giants"" Tickets on such short notice. My first Game ever....I will Never forget it!. And Hugs from Jennifer Loh made our trip complete!. So many Wonderful memories for Me and my Ohana (family) Mahalo Nui Loa (Thank you Grand Hyatt San Francisco from the bottom of our hearts)",25-May-15,5
"I generally like Hyatt hotels and this one was pretty good as well.The staff was efficient and accommodating.I did find two draw backs.The beds could use renewing, they are very soft and I prefer a firm mattress.The exercise room was on the small side and if you wanted to work out before work without waiting in line you better be there before 6:00 AM.",25-May-15,4
"So far the business hotels of other big chains were rather disappointing. So the Grand Hyatt was a very positive surprise. Everything new and clean, no worn out carpets, etc. My room was on the 8th floor on the backside. Not the perfect view but it was very quiet. Rooms are big, beds are good and here I could even handle the aleays present shower curtain. You have a little coffee maker for a first wake up coffee or to make hot water for a tea. There is a Starbucks in the bldg and one directly opposite. One block up Sutter St is a nice diner if you are looking for a good breakfast and there are also some nice pubs around. Little down was the pricing in the hotel bar. But all together - thumps up. ",24-May-15,5
"Good hotel, comfortable spacious accommodation in a brilliant location. Friendly staff: Welcoming reception staff and knowledgeable concierge offered good advice for our first visit to San Francisco. Would recommend staying in Union Square.",24-May-15,5
"First time visit to San Fran.Stayed here for convention at Moscone Center, which was a short 10 minute walk away. Our initial room was on the 12th floor with a Union Square view. As a fan of high floors, and awesome views, it did not cut it, so we asked to move, and for a slight rate increase our request was granted. New room was on the 24th floor with awesome view of the Bay and had a better layout than the previous. Bountiful choices for shopping and dining nearby. We did have a rental car, which was $41 a day to ""self park"" which is not really self parking since you hand over the keys to someone to park your car. We did have to go back to the car to get our luggage the 1st day, and lets just say they park the cars very tight! Could barely get the suitcases out of the trunk. Also note it is across the street and requires 3 left turns to get back to it if you pull in front of the hotelThis area is very busy with pedestrian traffic and for the most part felt very safe. Walked to the Masonic Theater one evening for a Sammy Hagar/James Hetfield Acoustic Benefit concert for pediatric cancer. No issues walking back at 11pm after the show.If this is your 1st time to San Fran be prepared for some serious hills and elevation changes while walking! We walked to Tony's Napoletana and then to the Piers, Ghiradelli Square and Lombard Street. Amazing views, but we were exhausted! Would do it again in a heartbeat.Hotel is maybe 15 minute drive to Golden Gate Bridge. Drive over to the other side and drive the road up to ""Hawks Point"" which is at an elevation of 805 feet. Best vantage point of the city from up there. Muir Woods is a must as well, but try to go off peak.",24-May-15,4
"Our stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel exceeded our every expectation. Terrific location, upgraded room was beyond belief, and service by all staff was ""Grand""! Of the thousands of hotels we have stayed in over the years this experience was ""the best""!",24-May-15,5
"Location is great, walking distance to majority of important places. Clean rooms with great view from higher floors ( we were on 24th ). Breakfast was one of the best during this our stay in US. We have tried the dinner once as well and we were satisfied too. Willing personnel. Everywhere clean.",23-May-15,4
"I just arrived 15 minutes ago and was badly welcomed by a bad behavior receptionist. This kind of attitude does not fit at all to this high class fancy hotel. Then, my room should be available by 3pm and the receptionist just said coldly that it was not available and not even an apology. Unbelievable! I hope the manager can read this and give her more training.",22-May-15,1
"Impressive view of the room, cleening and stlyle. I just love it! Plus, there are no additional charges when you deliver a package from Amazon or other online sites to the hotel (as other hotels do, such as Sheraton).",22-May-15,5
The Union Square area is under a lot of construction right now but the hotel itself was a pleasure to stay at. It's convenient to the BART and local city transportation options as well. I'm a Diamond Hyatt member and the club access is great with stunning views and very attentive staff. Really nice stay.,21-May-15,4
Be wary of staying in rooms close to Union square as the roadworks and adjacent construction occur day and night. The noise was audible from the 18th floor. Nice room and good location. Friendly staff.,21-May-15,3
"Got upgraded to a bay view room with grand club access. The food at the club was great. Rooms are updated, spacious, and clean. Bay view was spectacular. Nothing I can complain about. I have stayed at the Westin St. Francis a few times as well and I would give the Grand Hyatt a slight edge over it.",20-May-15,5
"I have stayed at the Park Hyatt Hotels in other countries and have had wonderful experiences. However, the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco left me unsatisfied. The hotel staff were very professional. However, we had requested assistance in getting dinner reservations from the checkin rep. She stated that she would take care of it and would contact us. We never heard from anyone at the hotel regarding the dinner reservations. The hotel had no store to purchase water and other items needed throughout our stay. There were no water bottles in our room until the night before our departure (which was I assume, the maids attempt to make a good impression for tipping purposes only). Lastly, although our room was clean everyday, the mattresses left my husband and I with back pain every morning. On a good note, the doormen were always there to open the door for us, they got taxis for us immediately and the location was perfect--right in Union Square.",20-May-15,3
"This hotel is very centrally located and walking distance to many attractions. The staff was polite and helpful throughout our visit. Our room was adequate in size, updated, and clean. Our only two complaints are 1) the low water pressure/rain shower head make showering slightly difficult and 2) housekeeping came in to our room even though we had the privacy sign on our door. I don't think I would use these as reasons to not stay here again, but if these things matter to you, then it's important you know. ",19-May-15,4
"Great place to stay in SF, close to Macy's and Union Square, so good if you want to go shopping. Lobby had popcorn and lemonade while we waited to check in and champagne when we checked out. Room was spacious, no noise from neighbours or the street, pressure in the shower was nice and strong and the bed was big and comfy. So it ticked all my boxes. I would definitely stay there again and have recommended it to my parents on their visit.",19-May-15,5
"The hotel had a GREAT location - close to shopping and restaurants and Union Square. Room was nice with a good view of the water, but the bathroom sliding door did not close all the way, and the shower had no water pressure. Free wifi, didn't eat at any of the restaurants. We did get locked out of our room and they sent maintenance up right away to let us in. Staff was very friendly and helpful.",19-May-15,3
Stayed for a couple of nights to see the Giants. Nice hotel. Interesting lobby and is smallRoom was clean average size.People were great and very helpfulRoom not ready so went to bar for a couple of beersCoors Lite 12 oz draft $9.00 each seems a bit high.Close to Union Square and lots of great places,19-May-15,4
Insanely expensive. But didn't mind since someone else was paying for me.Reception is great. As u would expect.Rooms are pretty standard affair. But since mine was at the 19th floor so view was great. 1 complain I have is they didn't have a glass for water in the room.,18-May-15,4
great staff courteous helpfull and friendly. absolutely loved the room .Best view of san francisco i`ve ever had I have already recommended others to this hotel and will continue to send others in the future,18-May-15,5
"Stayed for a few days while attending a convention. I liked the peace and quiet in the stylish and modern room, the comfortable bed and the above-average quality of the in-room coffee and tea selection (always a nice touch). But apart from this, the hotel offers little else for a relaxing stay: the large lobby is extremely busy and noisy, with throngs of people being shunted through at all times, the mezzanine bar likewise. Perhaps the only thing to go some way towards making up for these shortcomings is the (not so busy) fitness room on the 35th floor, with views across the skyscraper jungle towards the bay. Overall an ok stay, but not quite so convincing value-for-money.",17-May-15,3
"Hotel was wonderful, I would have given this 5 stars except for the noise that came from the construction that ran over into our meeting. No fault of the hotels but annoying none the less.Hotel staff partnered with us to make this a positive experience for our attendees.Location was great; lots of shopping, restaurants and public transportation within walking distance.Hotel lobby was unique and well decorated. Sleeping rooms were clean and comfortable. Showers were great with good pressure.Food was the best conference food I've ever experienced.",16-May-15,4
"Overall, this hotel was great. Only complaint was that the bed wasn't comfortable. Mattress was likely on the older side and I sank right into it, resulting in back pain each morning. Everything else was top notch.",16-May-15,4
"great location, great 35th floor workout room with killer views of the city..breakfast at hotel was outstanding, fresh, very good quality food...lots to do in the area...shopping in area something for everyone...",16-May-15,5
We had booked this hotel as part of our honeymoon through a booking site for 4 nights. Upon check in we were made welcome and checked in very swiftly and on check out we were advised that we had no charges and everything was prepaid. 2 weeks after returning home the hotel charged the entire stay to my credit card which we had provided for incidentials. When I rang and emailed the hotel I was advised that we had cancelled our reservation with the booking site and this is why they billed us directly. This has put a real stink on our once in a lifetime honeymoon/holiday and we found the customer service to be very poor. Also SF is beautiful however it dosnt feel very safe especially at night. ,15-May-15,1
"The hotel was clean, well decorated, and centrally located to all the desirable ""tourist"" destinations. The view from our window was incredible at night; so much so, that we elected to sleep with the shade open to view the nighttime skyline. The staff was helpful and courteous. We will be back.",15-May-15,5
I stayed at the Hyatt for a business trip and would love to return for leisure. The hotel is beautiful and well-kept. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast that was included with my room was also amazing! But the best part was the view! Amazing views! Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area!,14-May-15,5
Rooms were tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The hotel location is very convenient. Rate was great for the quality of the property. Fitness center was small but great views! Large hotel but 'small' hotel feel. Great lobby - cozy and comfortable.,13-May-15,5
I was there for Business and leasure. Location is just perfect as it could be. Staff was Not caring except of the valet Parking Team and concierge at Club which Are great. No water in minibar or in the room. You have to take care to get it at the icemachine if you like to drink something in the night.,13-May-15,3
Excellent hotel room and staff. Great location right in the middle of Union Square with lots of dining and shopping options. I had left an item in the room safe and the security staff was very responsive and helpful in retrieving the item and mailing it to me. The room is very nice and cozy.,13-May-15,5
"I have visited this property several times and it is still improving. It is close to BART, shopping, the ballpark, the cable car to fisherman's wharf, etc. But the property is also nice enough for a staycation with the fitness center, business center and the views.",13-May-15,5
The location is ideal for visiting the theatre district or shopping in Union Square. The overall atmosphere of the hotel is excellent. Views from the higher floors can't be beat. Used the new mobile check in which worked flawlessly.,13-May-15,5
"Excellent location for this Hyatt - staff extremely attentive - would definitely stay here on my next San Francisco visit. The OneUp restaurant/bar was open late which helped with a place to retreat to for good food, drinks and conversation after a long day of San Francisco sight seeing.",12-May-15,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a night in May on our way back into San Francisco. Our room was located on the 25th floor and it was great. Very modern, all amenities and really well looked after. We we there with some of my work mates and had drinks in the bar on the 1ST floor. Service and the drinks were great also. No complaints with this hotel and our preferred over the Westin as we had stayed there earlier in the same week. The Grand Hyatt is much more modern and contemporary.",10-May-15,5
"Excellent location off Union Square. I really liked the room layout and furniture. Also has block out blinds. Great mezzanine bar and restaurant really added to the experience as I don't spend much time in the room!House keeping wake up at 8.45 on Saturday morning was ridiculous, but all other staff really friendly and helpful while professional.Ask for a late check out!",10-May-15,4
"Grand Hyatt staff was very helpful, friendly and courteous. Willing to answer questions about locations and travel without issue. Loved the hotel decor. Very modern. Location was close to lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Enjoyed the view of the city from the room.",10-May-15,5
"I had conference San francisco Moscone center. It was walking distance to the center and union square for great shoppingGreat views from the restaurant, very helpful concierge service.I will come back with my family next time.",10-May-15,5
"Located right in the heart of Union Square and San Francisco, this Grand Hyatt is a fabulous choice for lodging and dining in the city. The staff was exceptional...at check in, in the restaurant, and on the club level. We would go back again and again!",10-May-15,5
"The Hyatt is about 20 mins walk to Fishermans wharf. It is very close to Chinatown though but I found that to be alittle dirty.The bed was a king and was very comfortable with great pillows. The bathroom and shower was well presented and clean. Free wifi, self parking is $40 per day close by with in and out access and valet is about $61 for a park (I don't think you can go in and out). When you pull up out the front they will let you know these options.",8-May-15,4
Stayed for 4 night for a business conference. The room was clean and overall comfortable. The chair at the desk sat too low to work comfortably there. The overall work out facility is adequate and has a nice view. The hotel's location is convenient to shopping and convention center.,8-May-15,4
"I stayed here only for one night. The room looked like it was very recently remodeled and it was lovely and quite large. I like the motorized window shade on the very large picture window. Nice view of the city and the bay. Unfortunately, the hotel room was very noisy. Conversation in the hallway was fully audible and the ac unit was also loud. On the plus side, ear plugs were provided! Location right off Union Square was convenient.",5-May-15,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a week. great weather and the city is worthy of a visit. Grand Hyatt disappointed. While many Union Square hotels are pricy, we picked the Grand Hyatt because we stayed at this brand in other cities. For the price, it did not seem a bargain. Lobby, restaurant were nice but our room seemed very dated. uncomfortable seating. Shower (tower) had low pressure and seemed less than normal. Overall I would not stay here at this location again.",4-May-15,3
"Stayed here four nights during a twelve day stay. Very nice and secure. Close to everything- restaurants, China Town, museums, trains, Trolleys. I parked my car elsewhere because to hotel's fee. There are plenty of garages around. Would visit again!",3-May-15,5
"First the good:1) Location in the heart of downtown San Francisco overlooking the bay and restaurants, attractions etc.2) Service was good for most part - Belldesk, Checkin etc3) We had an infant travelling with us and the Hotel took extra care to make our stay pleasant. 4) BAd:1)Price is definitely on the high side.2)Parking is very close but pretty expensive with Valet running at $60+ a day and self at $41 so if you can avoid dont bring a rental car 3) Housekeeping wasn't responsive. We forgot toothpaste and it took them almost a day to get it to us.",2-May-15,4
I stayed 4 nights. With the combination of adjoining room and poor windows it was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. When I asked to move from the room I was told 90% of the rooms where adjoining. Terrible for what they describe as an executive suite.,2-May-15,2
Highly recommended hotel with friendly helpful staff. Starbucks conveniently located in the lobby for morning coffee and pastries. Conveniently located and easy to get around with and without a car. Keeping car at hotel is expensive but convenient. Clean and modern and good gym facilities.,1-May-15,4
"Room- A little dated, very dusty, creaky walls..Staff- Helpful, Polite, Location- Fantastic location on union square made it easy to go anywhere.. This is what your paying for.. Facilities- Didnt get a chance for restaurant experience but hear it's very nice, no pool, starbucks across road..",29-Apr-15,3
"Great business hotel, very well located. Staff is great, bar/lounge is very good, location is very central right next to Union Square, and rooms are very clean and comfortable. Grand Club is beautiful, although food choice could be larger.",29-Apr-15,5
"I stayed three nights. Decent distance to subway (BART) and plenty of bus stops nearby. Was in town for business conference at Moscone and found it convenient and very agreeable walk back and forth. Lots of shopping and dining options in walking distance as well. Fast elevators, friendly staff. Would definitely consider staying here again for business trip. Not really a kid-friendly hotel but not unfriendly either. But definitely more of the corporate, tourist option as opposed to staying in a quaint, neighborhood hotel or VRBO - so if I brought wife or family I'd look at getting out of the core SF downtown and finding something with more local and cultural flavor and appeal.",29-Apr-15,5
"I got a surprisingly good rate on this (still expensive!) and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Overlooking Union Square, the hotel is very modern, stylish and the room was spacious and well furnished. Staff were friendly and room service excellent and prompt. Minor quibble was that the bathroom did not live up to the expectations set by the room - but it was fine.",28-Apr-15,4
"The hotel is perfectly located at the central area of San Francisco, very close to the cable car, and close to several stores and restaurants! The union square area also is very safe to walk at night and we didn't have any kind of trouble or dangerous situation.The rooms are very spacious, beds are very confortable, and service was very attentive and fast!The only two downsides were the rooms a little noisy, specially in the morning (you could hear other rooms doors opening and closing), and the Internet work a little irregularly.Besides that I think that a hotel at this should have the breakfast included.In general the hotel is very good and I would come back!!",28-Apr-15,5
"property has been updated and staff are top notch. Would like better restaurant on premises. If you are out of town guest, the location could not be better...anytime of year...especially December holidays.",28-Apr-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt is one of these 'can't really go wrong but won't be too memorable either' hotels, of which there are so many these days. It's all it promises to be: at a great location almost directly on Union Square, friendly receptionists and concierge, efficient, spacious rooms, good breakfast with a great spread. The views from floor 18 or so upwards are wonderful, going over SF's roofs and onto the Bay. I was a bit disappointed with the gym, which was small, cramped full of machines and quite characterless. But beds were good and - important for those intercontinental travellers among us - the blinds made the room completely dark. Oh, and the free wifi signal was very strong, even in the upper floors! A quick word of warning: there's a building site in front of the hotel at the moment so the lower floors should perhaps be avoided (some of our party had difficulties with noise). Overall a very good and comfortable stay - just not a spectacular one.",28-Apr-15,4
"Fabulous location if you're a shopper. Lots of construction in the area make it more difficult to get around, however. The staff (especially the front desk staff) were very helpful. Rooms were nicely appointed and comfortable. Wish I were there longer (only stayed one night) to use the other amenities in the hotel.",28-Apr-15,5
"The hotel was remodeled a few years ago, and is now a very modern, sleek hotel in downtown San Francisco. It is situated on Union Square, and is just a short walk/cab ride from most of San Francisco's main attractions. It is definitely a fantastic location - and if you're visiting San Francisco for tourism, you'll want to stay in a hotel that's this convenient.I arrived early, not expecting to be able to check-in, but the hotel staff kindly took my number, and within 15 minutes they had my room ready. I was booked in a suite on the second night, and a standard room on the first night, but the staff realized that asking me to change rooms would be inconvenient and thus allowed me to stay in the suite for both nights for only slightly more money. The room was fantastic, with two bathrooms, two televisions, and a nice living area. The views were great, and if you are one of those travelers that likes to exercise, then you'll enjoy the fantastic views from the hotel's 35th floor gym. My only critiques of the hotel are the following: --This hotel has (just like many others) done away with minibars (there is a small refrigerator) in the room, this is fine but there were no water bottles in the room (not even for purchase). I found this to be really inconvenient. I did ask for waters, and the hotel did bring me several (at no charge), but the second night we actually ordered water from room service, and a large bottle of mineral water was $20 (after taxes, delivery fees, and tip). --Room service isn't 24 hours, again, not that important, but full service hotels traditionally have 24hr room service. If I remember correctly, room service was only available in the evening, and for breakfast (most travelers staying at the property probably don't stay in to eat lunch). --I am a Hyatt Platinum member, and I stay at Hyatt hotels around the world frequently. I found the toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash) to below the standard of what I would normally expect from a ""Grand Hyatt.""Overall this is a great hotel, with great service, and a great location. Try booking through Hyatt's website to get a good deal (you may be surprised). I found the rates to be very competitive even though I made the reservation about a week before my stay during a busy spring weekend.",27-Apr-15,4
"I loved the dinning experience in Grand Hyatt, the service is what I particularly valued. The staff and manager in the restaurant provided personal service and answered every question. Plus, the location of the hotel is so close to the center area of the city!",27-Apr-15,4
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF for 6 nights last months and had a great stay. The check-in was very quick, friendly and professional. Got a corner room on one of the lower floors, but it was really nice and clean. The location of this hotel is fantastic, only a few steps from Union Square. The service was overall very good and I will surely return to this hotel next time in San Francisco.",27-Apr-15,5
"This is my second time staying at the Grand Hyatt, San San Francisco. Rooms with king size beds is slightly smaller and the bathroom is slightly older compare to double bed rooms.Cons: - Great location- Grand lobby- Friendly staffPros: - Some rooms needs to be updated- Lobby is nicer than rooms - Rooms with king size bed is cramped- TV is position oddly on the wall (king size room)",26-Apr-15,3
Great stay in SF in perfect location at Union square. Web check in was a breeze and the kiosk check in at arrival was smooth. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful from the valet to the restaurant staff. We had a great view of union square in our room 1719. The hotel was the most reasonably priced hotel around and I will book again on our frequent trips to the city. ,26-Apr-15,5
I stayed here with my wife for a few days and it was great. Rooms were a bit smaller than some hotels but not much to complain since it was in the middle of San Francisco. I would recommend this place for anyone that needs to visit SF.,26-Apr-15,5
"We spent spring break in SF and were extremely pleased with the hotel. Beautiful adjoining rooms with a great view of the city, the bay, Alcatraz, and Coit Tower. Excellent service and amenities and a perfect location.",25-Apr-15,5
"Checked into the hotel very easy. The staff are really friendly. We had an amazing view from the 20 floor and there's still another 15-16 above. The hotel is central to everything, there's plenty of shops and not far from the cable cars to take you to fishermans wharf. Will stay again",25-Apr-15,5
"Situated in city centre near Union SquareRooms clean and comfortable but nothing special. Floor to ceiling windows provide nice views on higher floors. Disappointing that the Grandviews top floor bar is now closed, so residents can't access, used to be one advantage of staying at this hotel. Had fantastic views across the city and bay. ",23-Apr-15,3
"So the location is excellent, the rooms nice and functional, it overlooks Union Square, is a short walk (albeit through construction) to get to the main shopping areas and Macys is on the far side of Union Square from it. However the service just doesn't match. It was slow...so so slow. They also neglected to advise or mention the 24 hour construction work that is going on right outside the hotel. The only hint when I arrived in my room was the industrial strength ear plugs that were provided. 12th floor and earplugs and still I was woken at 4am by the drilling and clanging. While I appreciate that the construction is not the fault of the hotel, when I asked for a room with a view, I thought perhaps it might have been mentioned that the view would come at a cost - lack of sleep. They leave an impressive list of items that are available to you should you require them at no extra cost - the usual, toiletries etc. - however you will be waiting up to an hour to have any of these delivered so if you want something in a hurry, it would be quicker to run to the Walgreens around the corner or to Starbucks across the road if it's refreshments you are looking for. I also find that providing only creamer powder for the lovely filter coffee defeats the purpose. On requesting actual milk or cream for my tea and coffee it was suggested I buy it from the above mentioned Walgreens and use the fridge in the room. Which I did!Would I return? Not by choice. There are too many other places to stay!",23-Apr-15,3
"Friendly staff, nicely appointed rooms, good location. Beware if you are a light sleeper like I am (there's a reason the rooms have ear plugs in them) as even on the 21st floor, I can hear the construction coming to life at 4 am. Certainly not the hotel's fault (my room does face Union Square and I couldn't move as the hotel is full due to a conference) but you may have a hard time sleeping.",22-Apr-15,4
"The staff here is uniformly among the best I've had the pleasure to meet. You expect great location and views in hotels of this caliber; it's the staff that sets the Grand apart from many of its competitors. One of the delightful surprises of the trip was looking out our window to find that we overlooked the alley in which Sam Spade's partner was shot in The Maltese Falcon. If you've any interest in San Francisco literary history, the GH is a great place to start the tour. I am looking forward to my next visit!",21-Apr-15,5
"I really like this hotel. It is right near Union Square and an easy walk to Moscone. However, there is construction noise during the day that is unmanageable. This is going to go on for quite some time too as the City is building a subway down Stockton Street. If you have to stay, go for a high floor to get away from some of the sound and try to get a room facing Sutter. The rooms are really nice and have floor to ceiling windows with power shades that can be operated from either nightstand. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is well appointed. The water pressure is weak but that is probably drought related.",21-Apr-15,3
Just had a really warm and friendly experience at the Grand Hyatt SF. I travel over 200 nights a year around the world and these guys are up there with the best. The One Up lounge has a good selection of wines by the glass. The Grand Club staff are so friendly and will go way beyond their job to help you. Small club lounge but great views and excellent canapÃ© selection in the evening.,21-Apr-15,5
"This hotel is excellent. We got a room facing downtown SF and the bay.. It is definitely one excellent view of the beautiful city.Rooms are decently sized for a hotel in downtown SF, and impeccably clean.Location is great! Within walking distance to the many department stores and restaurants.Concierge is also always very helpful and friendly.Now on to the slight minor issues..You basically have to request everything.. from slippers to shower caps!We requested for some shower caps and were told that they run out!Oh and they have construction next door; however, we didn't find any disturbance from that.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for travellers looking for central location.",21-Apr-15,5
"This is my second stay at the Grand Hyatt since the renovation (the first was actually during the renovation). The hotel is in a great location, nice and very modern. The rooms are good size and most, at least on upper floors, have great views. The lobby makes it feel more like a boutique hotel. The staff are very helpful. I'd recommend for both business and vacation.",20-Apr-15,5
"I stayed here with my family (2 adults, 2 teens) arriving on 7th April for 6 days. When you arrive, super greeting from doormen and lobby reception team, very informal and friendly yet efficient. Obviously coming from the UK we were all very tired on arrival, were given a room on the 12th floor so off we went, I will cut a quite long story short or I'd go on for days, the room smelt very strongly on stale cigarette's and as none of us are smokers we really didn't want to stay in it for almost a week. The chap who showed us to the room came back up and said 'I'll get housekeeping to spray around and open the window for a while' which I did have a little laugh to myself about. Went to room number 2 also on 12th floor, my husband went to open the French window a bit and the frame broke completely then wouldn't shut, not ideal either, engineer came up and hammered it back into place but meant no fresh air for our stay as the door now couldn't be opened. Room number 3 on 17th floor was much better, roomier and cleaner but the noise from the works next to hotel was a shocker and they have a 24hr licence to work so the noise was going to stay! Anyway properly 3rd time lucky and were given a room on the 25th floor, super clean, roomier like the 17th floor and had fab views over the bay, so phew we could finally unpack and start our trip!! Location of hotel was perfect to get everywhere, close to restaurants, great designer shops on Union Square, Bus tour stops, trams, cable cars, all on your doorstep! The staff on reception were friendly and helpful, I definitely wasn't a cross complainer but when you go on a trip like this with your family you want it to be right. The One Up bar is a great place to nip in after a big day sightseeing for a drink and a quick use of the wifi as here has the best reception. I think it was a Friday evening, a singer was in the bar who was great, good atmosphere, good spot to relax.The room we ended up in was super, good sized bathroom, robes on request, shower I found no problem with as I had read before about the water pressure being weak but it was fine. Great housekeeping service, turndown service of an evening if you wanted it, fresh towels daily and a good little coffee machine in your room. Lovely comfortable beds and bedding too. The gallery on the 36th floor has amazing views of the bay and over the city so well worth a visit for photo's. My husband used the gym a couple of times and was 100% happy with it. Even after our rocky start I would stay here again without a doubt. Our stay in San Francisco was really great, it just was over too quickly!!",20-Apr-15,4
"The hotel was a perfect location to explore San Francisco during my first visit to the city. However, be warned - the rooms are not very soundproof - I could hear every word the two families next to me said, and they were not particularly noisy.",20-Apr-15,4
"We stayed 8 nights on Bay View Room, on the 26th floor.The outstanding view from the room on sunrise or sunset worth every nickel.Except for some police sirens from the city during day (after all this is center of town), no noise came into room. we had quite nights.The service is beyond our expectation. for example: there is no kettle in room (there is coffee machine), and when we asked hot water from room service, we got them in 2 minutes.Excellent bath room, Excellent bed, Excellent interactive interface on TV, a lot of TV channels.Close to bus stations and also to the shopping on Market street and Macy's.",20-Apr-15,5
"I stayed here for the first time and was completely pleased with the hotel and its location. The room was clean, modern and quite accomodating. It's centrally located- walking distance from most places, shopping, restaurants etc. The hotel staff was also helpful. I checked in late and was helped to find a local restaurant.Would definitely stay here again.",19-Apr-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt staff greeted me with a big smile, and that's always the best first impression. The lobby is quite small and informal so I immediately started wondering what the rooms would be like. When checking in, I mentioned that I wanted to go to the gym and I was offered a room on the 32nd floor so that I could be closer to the gym that was located two floors above me. That was a very nice touch. When I entered my room I was excited to see my view was overlooking Union Square. Such a beautiful view! The room had a tasteful clean and modern decor with wood floors. I hate carpets so this was a plus! Everything was high tech, with automatic sunshades on the windows. My bed was big fluffy and very comfortable. The spacious bathroom had an entire line of skincare products, soaps and shampoo etc. The gym was decent with free weights and cardio equipment and offers a great view onto the city while you workout. The view over San Francisco is spectacular from the top floor where you can see the entire city of San Francisco. As for location, you can't get better. You're right in the middle of everything. Walking distance to shopping, food and galleries. I would most definitely come back to this hotel and the hotel staff is wonderful. Thank you.",19-Apr-15,4
"The Grand Hyatt is very well located and a well run property. I visit two or three times a year, and this is always my hotel of choice in SF. Rooms are spacious and amenities are above average. Valet parking is pricey as it is in any urban hotel. The Club Level for Hyatt members is especially nice. A full breakfast is served as well as a happy hour light buffet. The view is terrific. I'll be back and highly recommend the Grand Hyatt.",18-Apr-15,5
"If you want to be centrally located on your next leisure trip to San Fran, then I recommend the Grand Hyatt. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The concierge service is also very informative on what to do in the area. As a Hyatt diamond member access to the Grand Club on the 32nd floor is included. Great views, and a really great spread for breakfast and happy hour. The OneUp bar is really a must visit too, but the experience definitely depends on the bartender you get. We had some outstanding ones, and some wet noodles. While I was mostly here on vacation with my wife, I had some business at the beginning of the week also, so WiFi and business center were critical. The WiFi in my room was especially spotty (very unreliable DNS), the staff do everything they can to address the issue, but it's all outsourced so its a tiring pass the buck, please reboot your device kinda dance. The business center is just sad. A small cubby without even one outlet to plug my laptop into! really!?! Also, spring/summer of 2015 they are building an Apple store right next door so be prepared for construction noise! And all day long! All in all though, a really good hotel.",18-Apr-15,4
"Stayed here with my wife and daughter for a few days. It was perfect. We did not want the best, but wanted a reasonable value for a hotel with good location. This fit our needs perfectly. Rooms were clean and nice. Loved the Union Square location. Did not eat anything at the hotel, so can't comment on that. I would definitely stay again.",17-Apr-15,4
"We have just returned from a trip to San Francisco where we stayed at the Grand Hyatt. I was expecting a generic city centre hotel, but this was far from it. The views were incredible, and I absolutely loved the electronic blinds on the wall-sized windows. The beds were very comfortable (there were two small doubles in the room). The air conditioning unit was quite loud and made some weird clunky noises.The bar area was very good, and aside from a relatively grumpy bar man, was a great experience with lovely cocktails. We also ate in the bar where they serve good snacky food (burgers, flat bread etc). Breakfast was served in the restaurant and was either buffet style or you ordered from a menu. The buffet was great, with so many options (there were 3 different kinds of scrambled egg!) and they make eggs for you if you ask your waiter. Coffee and orange juice was consistently topped up, and one of my favourite things was the size of the orange juice glasses, they were huge! I hate having my morning juice out of thimbles. Special mentions to Linda who served us on a number of occasions and was lovely, and also to a man in the restaurant at breakfast whose name escapes me, but he was fantastic, remembering our name, and nothing was too much trouble for him. The location is perfect, you are right next to Union Square. There are some serious works going on around there at the moment so it looks a little bit messy, but you can still easily navigate around.I would definite recommend staying here if visiting San Francisco.",16-Apr-15,5
"Will definitely stay here again! The views were spectacular and each room has floor to ceiling windows. The hotel was spiffy, clean and well maintained. The Grand Hyatt's location is 1/2 block off Union Square so if is super convenient to all kinds of shopping. The San Francisco transportation system is so discombobulated that I found it difficult to get to some of the tourist sights such as the Golden Gate bridge -- you have to make three transfers. It is only 4 blocks from the BART which whisks you to SFO in thirty minutes. Was a little surprised that the Grand Hyatt only had high end breakfast and dinner -- and grab and go breakfast. Food in the area was touristy.",14-Apr-15,5
"This is an attractive hotel, in a great location, with fantastic, professional staff. Despite its large size, the layout, decor, and courteousness and attentiveness of the staff make the hotel feel more intimate and homey. Outstanding views from rooms and especially from the fitness center. There was a mysterious wet spot on the carpet when we arrived that was quickly addressed, and it would be nice to have in-room coffee or complimentary coffee in the lobby in the mornings, in addition to the paid coffee bar, but these are minor gripes for what is overall a very good, borderline excellent hotel.",14-Apr-15,4
"I visited the hotel for my birthday. When I originally arrived I explained that a previous mishap resulted in me being upgraded. I was put in the smaller room anyway. While I was out and about I called and talked to the front desk and explained to them that I was previously promised a larger room and I would like to have that because it was my birthday and I was in town celebrating. I gave them permission to move my items to the new room. When I returned I had rose pedals on my bed, wine, and a cheese and fruit plate. Also, there was a birthday card signed by every person working at the front desk that evening. I have never experienced such great customer service anywhere. I was so please with my room, the surprise items and especially the card. I plan on contacting the hotel manager to tell him how great this experience was. All of the staff I came in contact with were gracious, helpful and friendly.",13-Apr-15,5
"Our recent stay at the Grand Hyatt was fabulous! The staff - especially John, the concierge - was absolutely exceptional! The location was great and convenient to everything. I do recommend a high floor since there is currently construction in Union Square.",13-Apr-15,5
"We had a wonderful stay. From doormen to waiters to housekeeping, everyone greeted us warmly. The room was immaculate, the bed comfortable, the bathroom roomy and clean. It was a relaxing place to end the day.",13-Apr-15,5
"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary last week. Check-in was quick and easy. We were given a room on the ""quiet side"" of the hotel. I had read about the construction noise and was concerned about it, but we never heard a sound in our room (and we were only on the 5th floor). We were also given access to the club lounge on the 32nd floor which has amazing views along with food and drinks. The location was perfect for what we were looking for. Centrally located and public transportation was easily accessible. The room was spacious and clean. All in all it was a great trip and I would definitely stay here again.",13-Apr-15,5
"So when I think of a Hyatt Hotel, I think 5 star luxury! Unfort not this hotelPros- great location, fairly priced, good health clubCons- Tired rooms especially the bathrooms, weak water pressure and decor of corridors was very poor, slow wifi,",13-Apr-15,3
Didn't stay in the hotel much. Mostly spent all of my time out in the city walking around. Hotel is in a good location. It's close to all the shopping and about a 30 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Everything in the room was clean and the staff were friendly. There is always someone at the hotel door ready to open it for you. Overall I was pleased and happy to stay here again.,13-Apr-15,4
This hotel was perfect for our visit to SF. A few weeks before my arrival I spoke with the concierge. Liz was so helpful and pleasant. She helped plan a number of tours for me. Joanna also was so helpful. They both did a great job and made my visit enjoyable. The staff were all attentive and check in was quick. The hotel is clean and the rooms were very nice. The location in Union Square was perfect and we were able to walk to different restaurants.,12-Apr-15,5
"Staff was very friendly, facilities were all very clean, and you're only a short walk from lots of stuff to do.Downside:I think the rooms are a bit overpriced, they're on par with Ritz/Four Seasons, but for a hotel that isn't nearly as ""fancy"". I checked into another hotel after I got off the company dime!If you've got the money or if the company is footing the bill, I doubt you'd be disappointed with Grand Hyatt.",12-Apr-15,5
"The hotel's location is excellent. Rooms are not big but are nicely decorated, as it is the bathroom.I would not recommend the breakfast. The space is very small compared to the size of the hotel and queues are frequent. In addition it is split in two parts and if you are seated in the area far from the food you spend your time walking along the long corridor.The buffet breakfast is not exceptional.",11-Apr-15,4
"Grand Hyatt San Francisco is placed smack in the middle of union Square , Shops and conveniently close to Chinatown and transport to Pier 39, Fishermans Wharf. The Hotel is in good shape - seems recently renovated. We booked a high floor room with 2 double beds. Was surprised how noisy it still is from 28 th floor and the walls /doors are just thin to a level you can hear activity in hallways and rooms next to you. Hotel has ear plugs in the bath room - meaning they are aware the noise level may disturb. We slept well, but beds are on the small , if you have kids above 12 - would recommend extra connecting room instead. The lounge is fine - food is fresh and well displayed. Coffee is however below expectations - such a pity that GH has decided to go for mediocre coffee in the lounge. If you want good proximity to the action in San Francisco - can accept the natural noise from a big city - GH San Francisco is a good choice. The door man arranged a great SUV to the airport , at fixed price matching the taxi rate - much better.",11-Apr-15,3
"Just spent a week at the Grand Hyatt SF. Fantastic location in Union Square - close to everything and extremely convenient to restaurants, shopping, transportation, cable cars, Chinatown, Financial District, North Beach. Hotel has views from practically every floor and room. Service is excellent with many long time staff that I seen over the years, having stayed here for business and leisure for almost 20 years! Rooms are all renovated but still on the smaller side. Overall, highly recommend and my first choice whenever I'm in SF.",10-Apr-15,5
"My family of 5 stayed at this hotel for 3 days. Was a wonderful experience but definitely made better by having adjoining rooms. If we hadn't had this, the rooms would have been tight. The hotel itself was clean and well kept. The staff was terrific. They did their best to make us feel welcomed and helped us with directions, dinner reservations, and even made our kids' beds up special with their stuffed animals.",10-Apr-15,5
"Stayed here over the Easter holiday for a work. I always enjoy my time in San Francisco. Being at the heart of Union square in a newly renovated hotel made the fact that I was working during the holiday worth it. The staff were all friendly. Everyone said good morning. They were responsive to my needs (albeit they were very minimal). The gym up on the 34th floor w/ a sweet view of the city was awesome, too! Will definitely stay here again.",9-Apr-15,5
I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF at least three dozen times in the past five years and it is always a top choice for me when traveling to SF. The Concierge desk has a keen awareness for new local restaurants to explore and the staff truly take an interest in ensuring that you experience is satisfying.,9-Apr-15,5
Nice room. Comfy bed and pillows. Large desk for working. Nice chair/footrest for reading. I had a fabulous view of Coit tower and Transamerica bldg from 15th floor. Plenty of Elevators. Nice gas fireplace in lobby,7-Apr-15,5
"This was the second horrible experience we had with this hotel. The staff was lazy an not accommodating. We were lied to with regard to our room when making reservations. The air was out in our room and they said they would fix it and never did, but moved our room. Housekeeping was disgusting. The lobby was always packed and it took 15 minutes each time to get an elevator. The remote for the television was never brought to the room. The room service was horrible. The manager, Maria, was nasty. Rest assured, we will never return to this hotel.",7-Apr-15,1
The staff is friendly and very helpful. Super clean and comfortable! Centrally located in SF so you can easily see all the famous historical sights. Right next to Union Square and there are so many great restaurants close by.,7-Apr-15,5
"I was there for a week. 4 days on business and 3 vacation. Hotel: Hotel was in a great location. 2 blocks from Chinatown, and 1 block from Union square and cable cars. Basic Wifi was free with two upgrade options for 5.00 and 10.00 a day respectively.Rooms: Very clean, a tad small. Recently renovated and had a modern look. The bathroom sink was very modern looking but not very practical. The shower could have been a little better too, but no real complaints. 32 inch flat screen TV with Internet TV was a cool feature. Bed was very comfy with lots of pillows. Blinds are on an automatic switch which was handy. It can be a tad noisy depending on the side you are facing. There is Major construction going on, but you are given free ear plugs if needed.Staff: Very friendly and always willing to help.",6-Apr-15,5
"Should have been lovely, and bits of it were. But systematically not providing guests with water... leaving a coffeemaker broken in two pieces in the room, closing off the bar/dining room and cramming everyone into waiting for a tiny area for breakfast so management can rent out the top floor for weddings, these are not the hallmarks of any sort 'Grand' hotel.And yes, we worked around these inconveniences, but I felt rather sorry for the staff, whose aspirations for providing customer service so obviously exceed those of their employers.",6-Apr-15,3
"This hotel is near perfect, if for no other reason than its location. Right on Union Square, just about everything you need is within walking distance-shopping, restaurants, Chinatown, cable car-you name it! Plus, the views are spectacular, service is good and the rooms are clean and decent sized. The only drawback is parking-it's expensive and it takes a while to get your car, but that's normal for San Francisco. Other than that, it just doesn't get any better!",6-Apr-15,5
"This hotel location is excellent as are the rooms, spacious and well equipped with an air conditioner that Works beautiful, quiet and easy to set at your preference. Bathrooms smallish but still work ok. Lounge at mezzanine worth a visit for a pre or post dinner drink. I highly recommend this hotel and of course will be back.",6-Apr-15,5
"Check in process was quick and efficient. The staff were very friendly and helpful - all super nice. Lobby and elevators were fine. Hotel room was tired - needing to be refreshed (pulls in the carpet, arms of desk chair were worn\dirty).",6-Apr-15,3
"They care about you! I did not feel well late at night. I called and inquired about antacid. The bell boy was sent to retrieve antacid at the corner drug store, even after I declined the offer from the desk (I am stubborn). The rooms and bed were very comfortable and it is a wonderful location.",6-Apr-15,5
"the hotel was in a great location, the room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the staff was very helpful and friendly, the only issue was the construction site next store. The noise was very loud during the course of the night often found it hard to sleep.",6-Apr-15,4
"I enjoyed my time here at the Grand Hyatt. The location was superb (right in Union Square) and the staff was kind, prompt, and seemed genuine. However, I did not like the noise level. I could hear the entire conversation of my neighbors (and they weren't necessarily yelling) and the children in the room next to me were very noisy and the walls seemed to be paper thin. However, my room was clean, the sheets were clean, and there was complimentary water served to guests! I would recommend the hotel even with the noise levels.",6-Apr-15,4
"I consider this the near perfect location, next to Union Square, cable cars, Chinatown, Convention Center, right in between At&T park and Fishersman Wharf. The tour buses lined up right across the hotel by Macy's and numerous food option around within 5 blocks. The doorpeople were exceptionally pleasant and nice. The rooms were average, but the room service was nice. Go to the 36th floor for a 360 view of the city. A little pricy, but this is the big city.",5-Apr-15,4
"The service was terrific. The rooms were very good. The hallways and main public areas need some touch-ups. There is construction happening around the hotel, but the noise did not bother me - perhaps because I was away during the day.",5-Apr-15,4
"Great stay at the Grand Hyatt Union Square. Stayed for 4 nights for a conference. They put me in a corner king suite on the 11th floor that afforded me a decent view of the bay. Heard a little creaking noise in my room when unpacking. It was windy and the building sways some due to earthquake performance. Front desk had an air cleaner brought up which created a perfect amount of white noise to cover the creaking. Fitness center on 35th floor is great. Brand new equipment with an unbeatable view. Location is perfect for Union Square, Nob Hill, Moscone Center, etc. Great staff. Would definitely stay here again.",5-Apr-15,5
"Recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt, for a conference at Moscone West. The hotel was very accommodating, allowing an early check in, and the higher floors offer amazing views. With floor to ceiling windows, it was beautiful looking at the city lights at night. Only ate in the bar once, but good was good & priced similar to restaurants in the area.Positive: Quick elevators, clean room with a view, all necessary amenities, pleasant staff, short walk to Moscone Center if there for a conference (less than ten minutes), and a Starbucks right across the street.Negative: Rate was slightly higher then other hotels in the area, but no other complaints.Overall, a great place to stay.",4-Apr-15,4
"Was a comfortable hotel, we stayed in one of the Bay View King Rooms on the 27th Floor...+VSBrilliant view of the waters, the alcatraz, etcgreat for shopping, dining, walking around, everything within a stone throw's distancelively hotel-VSlacked personalized service",4-Apr-15,4
"Paid about $182 including tax. No free breakfast offered unless you have a membership. Parking was $26 a night. Given our options in the area, this was our best choice. A little too pricey for me considering breakfast wasn't included and I had to pay for parking.",4-Apr-15,5
"One of the best place I have spent both a weekend and business meetings. Just in the heart of San Francisco. Hotel has great service and facilities. Served food quality during business meetings was very good, like in high class restaurantes. Would recommend to all planning to have business meetings in San Francisco.",4-Apr-15,5
"If you're looking for a good base to see all that San Francisco has to offer the Grand Hyatt Union Square can definitely facilitate. With spacious rooms, comfortable beds and everything imaginable on offer the hotel has definitely covered all of its bases. We stayed in a suite on the 32nd floor which is the same floor as the lounge where you can enjoy refreshments, breakfast and afternoon tea whilst overlooking an spectacular view. I must say I was hugely impressed as this is one of the best views of San Francisco and the food on offer was excellent with plenty of healthy options available. If considering this hotel I would definitely consider higher rated rooms as they are definitely worth the extra money. The minibar however is empty and room service is expensive however there are both 7-11s and Walgreens nearby that has everything you may need. Overall I had high expectations of the Grand Hyatt Hotel and these expectations were definitely met and I was glad that I decided to stay there and will most likely be back when next in San Francisco. ",2-Apr-15,5
"We almost always stay at the Grand Hyatt - love the location, the rooms are wonderful and very nice staff. The Grand Club for Gold Passport members has stunning views and I like that it's open all day from 5:30am. Nice workout room, fast room service, and amazing views! They treat Gold Passport members very well here.",2-Apr-15,5
We stayed 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt for a SF vacation. The hotel is centrally located in Union Square. We stayed on the 21st floor. Yes there is some noise but you are in the city and one block from the cable car line so expect some noise. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. We slept great!We ate at the OneUp restaurant once and thought the food was very good.We used web check out and took their limousine service to the airport ($50).We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again!,1-Apr-15,5
"Clean, busy, shopping, starbucks, Launge, great great great LOCATION.Kids&family friendly.Nice view.Good bathroom.Comfortable bed.Again . This is an investment when it comes to the location.Though I don't think there is a swimming pool But overall I love it.",1-Apr-15,5
"Excellent experience at this hotel, would stay again! It was a little expensive even with the company discount i recieved. However the service more then made up for that. Great great great views from Grand Hyatt club",1-Apr-15,5
"I stay at Grand Hyatt properties all over the world, this property may not be the most extravagant but it met all my expectations for service and comfort. I was able to conduct business meetings in the second floor during the day very easily as there was no traffic or noise in the bar area. Even had coffee served from the breakfast staff during my meetings. After business, it is quite easy to enjoy oneself immediately as Union square is just one block away. Shopping, Restaurants are all blocks away and this is a great area to stay. E&O kitchen is one block away, great Asian fusion food with great cocktails.",31-Mar-15,4
"The Grand Hyatt was the base for my family's visit of San Francisco last August. The location was perfect for walking tours of the city. Our room had a fabulous view of the city, and we were very pleased with the cleanliness of the property and the size of the room. We booked a grand club room and the lounge access was worth the difference in price. We found the staff to be helpful and courteous. We had absolutely no complaints!",30-Mar-15,4
"Was thinking of going for dinner to a nice roof top hotel but we didn't find anything really cool with nice food. The view it was wonderful. 40th floor it was impressive, but the Menu it was really tiny. A place like that should also have some nice back ground music or even better some live jazz music.Personal was dressed so funny, weird but at least it was super gentle.",30-Mar-15,4
"Grand Hyatt San Francisco is a nicely renovated Hotel in central San Francisco, a few meters from Union Square. The Hotel is brand new and well decorated. Service is extremely effective with no queuing at reception. Hotel bar and restaurant are comfortable with excellent quality service. Rooms are large and those who are highest have great view over the city (I had a room on floor 28, marvelous view). The gym on floor 35 is equipped with modern and well maintained training machines. Wifi freeThis Hotel is to be recommended",25-Mar-15,4
"This is a very nice hotel, right next to union square and a lot of nice restaurants / bars / cafes / etc. Rooms are a little small, but the furniture is optimized to make the rooms look bigger. Service is excellent. Only weird thing is the checkout area, its not a regular looking area, its kind of like a weird triangle pod set up, I guess to make it seem more personal and interactive. Fitness room is a bit small but definitely workable. Wifi was fast - what you would expect for a hotel in the middle of SF.",25-Mar-15,4
"I was attending a medical meeting at the Moscone Convention Ctr . I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt (GH) since it is among the hotel choices with shuttle service. I will need three more hotel stays at the Hyatt to get the platinum status so it was an easy decision. We had an upgraded room near the lounge on the 31 floor; the room is comfortable, modern with a breath taking view of all the landmarks and some view of bay. By the bed, there is the multi-switch remote to automatically close/open the bay window blinds. The mesh curtain is an unique touch. The window treatment gets A+ for its function, smart look and classy beauty; it provides the uninhibited panoramic city view. I wanted to thank the courteous and professional staff associated with GH; from the minute we walk in, the doors are held open for us always, the open style reception islands mean no waiting line, quick service. I ordered a lunch box at the restaurant ""Step Up"" which offers a quite environment. I saw a lot of guest enjoy their salad/soup and a glass wine-it offers a perfect spot if one dines alone. Steps away from Chinatown which is one of the oldest in the country, it's a short walk over for a bowl of noodles or a crab feast. Visit the R & B Lounge at Kearney for the delicious crab ($51) cooked in many ways.On the first morning after I arrived, I left for breakfast before 7:30. I was so pleased that when I came back to the room to pick up some meeting stuff, the room was fully made. I must say, the high efficiency in housekeeping was the ""first"" among so many hotel stays. If the room is not made early in the morning, one would definitely understand. The problem is, at times, the guests do not know when the room will be cleaned so they wonder around outside not able to return to the room. I must give the house keeping staff a high mark for their superb efficiency. The lounge provides a ""room with a view""; it opens for fruit and drinks just about any hours. It has arrays of hot hors d'oeuvres, cookies and small tartlets in the late afternoon and evening. The continental breakfast of egg/cheese/lox/bagels which would make most people, young and old very happy and content. One memorable experience was to see a rainbow after a slight rain fall ...Billy who works at the lounge witnessed my enthusiasm, he showed me the way to the adjacent patio so I can take some pictures.If one is lucky enough to visit San Francisco, I would suggest to stay at GH for its friendly and superb services, for its modern and impressive room. If you want to spurge, you might upgrade yourself to the club level so you can taste the food, wine and watch the sunset. GH is a marvelous place and is a top rated hotel.",25-Mar-15,5
"Service: Excellent! From the bellhop to the frontdesk, Hyatt knows how to run a hotel. I think they are one of the greatest hospitality organizations in the world. Rooms: Small! I felt like I was in a small closet, and given the fact that I'm a pretty big guy, I felt a bit claustrophobic (not truly in the sense of the word, but more cramped). The decor is pretty nice, but I do recall paying an arm and a leg. But considering that you're in Union Square (read below further)...you shouldn't stay in your room.Location: Right by Union Square, so that's where the action is at. Don't wander to the Tenderloin area, folks (I learned my lesson there).",24-Mar-15,4
"We were so looking forward to staying at the Grand Hyatt during our most recent trip to San Francisco (March 10-12). Our room was clean and sophisticated, but for our first night we were placed on the 5th floor facing a construction site, and that construction went on through the entire night without stopping. Do whatever you can to avoid this situation. My husband and I put in ear plugs, wore headphones to bed, and turned on multiple white noise apps, but nothing could drown out the sound of jack hammers and heavy machinery all night long. It was honestly the worst night we have ever spent in a hotel-- we could not sleep at all. My husband had a presentation for work the next morning (which was the whole reason we were in town) and he had counted on a good night of sleep. Frankly, they should not be putting anyone in those particular rooms at this moment because the noise is unbearable. The second night we were thankfully switched to a quiet room on the 17th floor with a beautiful view without any problems, however, this did not overshadow our horrible first night.",23-Mar-15,1
"I stayed for 5 nights for a conference at the Moscone Center. From the moment I checked in, I could tell the service would be top notch. The staff at the front desk were welcoming and pleasantly efficient. The hotel is in a good location. Would definitely stay again.",23-Mar-15,5
"Iâ€™ve always enjoyed staying at Hyatts and I was very much looking forward to this one. Sadly it was the first to not live up to my expectations of the Hyatt brand.Booked a 5 night stay in July last year - $439 plus all the tax so approx. $500 per night. This was for a â€œGrand Club Kingâ€ù with access to the club lounge on the 32 floor. We arrived late after a long flight from London. I had asked (at time of booking - 8 months previous) for a quiet room on a high floor. At check I was told I was in a â€œgorgeousâ€ù quiet room on the 30th floor. It was clear that no one looks ahead to see the bookings for the next day and pre-allocates requested rooms. It is more a case of â€œturn up and hope for the bestâ€ù. NOTE: we couldnâ€™t use online check in â€“ it simply wouldnâ€™t work.The first disappointment was that, on entering the room, it was a connecting room (which means more noise). Second was the size of it â€“ it was very small with a tiny bathroom. Thirdly, we had a very dull view â€“ even from the 30th floor. Given we were there for 5 nights I would have hoped that we could at least had a view of the bay or out towards the Oakland Bridge. All we could see was buildings. We briefly contemplated returning to reception but we were both exhausted so we decided weâ€™d to ask to move rooms in the morning. We hit the shower and went to bed. Next morning, the queues at reception were huge so we didnâ€™t bother with an immediate request. Went for breakfast with the idea of trying again later only to be met with a â€œweâ€™re fullâ€ù when we did speak to the man on the Hyatt desk (I didnâ€™t believe him). So we ended up staying where we were. It was disappointing.There was no tub in the bathroom (too small) and when opening the shower door it was clear just how small the room was â€“ the shower door missed the WC by approx. 2mm max - space was that tight. The shower worked fine â€“ June Jacobs toiletries: green tea and cucumber (not known in the UK) There were ample towels but no mouthwash (Note: there is a list of things you can get from reception if you need them). The huge sink took up a lot of room on the bathroom vanity area and ours already had a hairline crack in it which didnâ€™t look good.The bed was comfy and the linens quite nice (but not Sofitel standard) From the bed you could switch on/off the lights and raise or lower the blackout blind. Other than that, there was a TV (didnâ€™t use it), fridge (empty â€“ what a waste of energy if they are in every room) and a safe. There was also a small coffee maker/water heater. There was one sofa seat and a foot stall plus a floor lamp. Wardrobe was decent size but not enough hangars for 5 days clothes. Housekeeping was excellent â€“ really lovely people who did a great job.Free wi-fi available everywhere including room. Only used it briefly so no idea if it would have allowed efficient work.There is construction around the hotel but the noise wasnâ€™t bad. Room neighbours could be heard through the connecting door (and they bizarrely decided to repair their push bikes in the corridor outside of the room which meant more disturbance)The â€œGrand Loungeâ€ù was just OK. Breakfast was carb heavy with just scrambled eggs as a hot savoury item (everything else was sweet). Breakfast time was exceptionally crowded. We only went to the evening presentation twice and again it was not great â€“ very limited choice of food items with an honour bar â€“ red/white wine and a few spirits. There were nice views of the bay and the bridge on 2 sides of the lounge (to show us what we were missing in our roomâ€_) Two MACs and printer allow you to print boarding passes etc.Overall I can honestly say I was very disappointed â€“ poor customer focus and poor value for money (total $2.5K). I certainly wouldnâ€™t choose it again nor recommend it to others. They get the very basics right (you get a bed and a bathroom) but other than that, you are just a commodity at this hotel â€“ we never felt like true â€œwelcomed guestsâ€ù.",23-Mar-15,2
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Valentine's weekend 2015 with our two kids (ages 6 & 8). The front desk service was excellent. We had reserved a bay view room, but the hotel was overbooked, so they had us in a room overlooking Union Square for one night at no charge, then moved us the next day to a bay view. The rooms themselves were identical - clean and sleek with modern bathrooms. The views - what a difference! There is construction on the Union Square side, and the noise goes on all night (there are complimentary ear plugs along with the toiletries). The Bay side is quiet and the view is the quintessential San Francisco experience, with Telegraph Hill in the distance.The hotel is within walking distance to Chinatown (a couple of streets over from the Dragon's Gate on Grant & Bush), Yerba Buena Gardens, and the Embarcadero (we walked all the way to the Exploratorium). It was too hilly for the kids to walk north to the Fisherman's Wharf and Lombard Street, so we took a cable car there and cab back. (I don't recommend the cable car, it's not as exciting as it seems; they pack you in there. It's cheaper to take a cab, even cheaper to take the bus.) If you want to go to the Golden Gate Park area, you would also need to take a cab. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt, would love to come back in the winter when there is ice skating in Union Square. Hopefully the construction will be done by then, otherwise, there is always the Bay side.",22-Mar-15,5
"First of all, I have to say that I didn't stay at this hotel to sleep. But I visited a conference, which was organised in a conference hall. And I have to admit that the place was chosen perfectly. The hall is big, it easily accepted all guests, there are several rooms for chilling out and drinking coffee. The hotel itself is luxury and imposing. However, I had constant problems with wifi.Downtown location gives easy access to all kinds of urban benefits.I had a minor trouble with my personal effects, and security service did their best to help me.",22-Mar-15,5
"Great trip to SF with my 18 year old son. Wonderful central location with super team at the concierge. Very contemporary design throughout hotel. Loved the clean comfortable rooms that were connected. Lots of electrical outlets, nice dressing area.",21-Mar-15,5
"We were impressed with the hotel. Upon arrival music was playing both outside and inside the hotel. The check in process was fast and the room was clean and modern. When opening the electric blind the view was incredible. We were on the 18th floor (out of 36) and the view was just amazing. We could see the sea in the distance and were surrounded by tall buildings. The staff were very friendly and the on site restaurant ""one up"" was very good. We visited the restaurant twice, and the second time our waiter ""Frank"" was absolutely brilliant. We left him a large tip! Highly recommended for a luxury feel good hotel. Only problem is that they moved the restaurant from the 36th floor to the 2nd floor!!! Silly mistake. 36th floor is now shut off to the public and is used as a business centre. Those views were unbeatable. ",19-Mar-15,4
"I've stayed in every Hyatt in the bay area and this is the most modern and probably the best on average, however the Hyatt Regency is in a better location (view wise) and is a little more relaxed. Although it is rated as 4 star it exceeds many of the 5 star hotels I've stayed in. The rooms are very modern with powered curtains and a variety of preset light settings. The lighting in the bedroom is rather dim and in the morning I would turn the TV on to try and get some extra light to see. The bathrooms are also well finished with slate floors and custom tiling. There's also a really large selection of bathroom products, if that is important to you. You can order room service from the television and there are a variety of connections for your devices. The club room on the 32nd floor offers a wide variety of snacks and has a nice selection for breakfast. It also has several workspaces. I think that access to the club lounge is essential because there is almost no lobby space or other area to relax in (aside from sitting on your bed). I don't have any criticisms other than to comment on the valet parking exceeding $60 a day. I know the hotel will likely say that it's standard for the area - as though that makes it any less egregious. Also, it's about 15% more than the average hotel valet charge. Overall I was please with the hotel and will no doubt return.   ",19-Mar-15,5
"Overall a friendly hotel in downtown location. China town and major stores are in walking distance; easy access to commercial zone.Wifi is terrible (or in fact, you may consider no wifi unless you pay to upgrade the speed.)",18-Mar-15,3
"We moved here from the Scarlet Huntingdon, and I prefer this place. Our initial check-in was warm and welcoming, with the staff taking extra time to ensure we were orientated. Of course, it's a bigger hotel, less 'style' and primarily orientated for business users, but the location is excellent and somehow felt more homely.We had cause to move rooms because of a technical problem, and this was handled quickly and efficiently. It's not the problems that put you off a hotel, it's how they are dealt with!The bar seemed small for a hotel of this size, but there are plenty of alternatives within staggering distance of the hotel. No pool here either,which is a shame, other hotels within the area offer this.I would stay here again if on business, but with so much other choice, I'd be tempted to find somewhere with a pool.",18-Mar-15,4
"My wife and I booked what we thought would be a high room with a view of the bay. We didn't have the view we wanted. When I called to the front desk they apologized and upgraded us to an amazing suite. They comped us with a bottle of wine and we got to enjoy a special lounge with drinks and appetizers. The view from the suite was amazing. The room was huge, with a 2 person tub that we enjoyed. It was an amazing experience. And when we got home I wrote to find out what kind of wine they had given us, and the manager had another bottle delivered to our house! I've never had service this good.",18-Mar-15,4
"I've stayed at this hotel a number of times, the location is perfect! The staff are so friendly and helpful, rooms are lovely and the gym has amazing views! I called reception to ask for more coffee and 4 packets arrived within a few minutes. There has been some construction work taking place in union square recently and the hotel has provided ear plugs - how thoughtful. I didn't hear any noise anyway!",18-Mar-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt was a highlight of my holiday to San Francisco. Ideally located on union square, the hotel is a short walk to all major attractions and shopping districts. There is a starbucks across the road and Macys one block away. The concierge team was a standout helping me plan an action packed two day visit. The newly renovated rooms are industry leading with free basic speed wifi, automated blackout curtains, large comfy beds and well appointed bathrooms. The OneUp Lounge bar located in the hotel was an excellent place to grab a drink with live music on Thursday and Friday night I was there. It was worth every dollar.",18-Mar-15,5
"The check-in was unique with no desk. Very personal, professional and quick. Room was extraordinarily clean every single day. Cleaning staff very respectful of time and space and took care of the small stuff. The Grand Club lounge was a great treat. The views from the dining area are spectacular, food was grand, especially the fresh lox for breakfast and desserts in the evening. Nice to grab a juice or water before trekking out to the city. Enough can't be said about this place. Parking was a small inconvenience (off site) but not a good enough reason to not go here again. ",15-Mar-15,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is an updated version of this hotel format located on the North Corner of Union Square. Convenient to cable cars and what passes for shopping in San Francisco, this is a really nice hotel that has recently been updated. San Francisco is a nice city but it has a problem with panhandlers and freaks.Hotels on the wrong side of Union Square swarm with tourists and pan handlers and sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is an oasis.With a nice open plan lobby greeting you, check in is at kiosk, Andaz-style with laptops/ipads. There is a cool lounge-y feel to the lobby with a coffee bar in the back. Up a set of floating stairs there is a decent restaurant.Rooms are nice, get a view if you can. There is construction going on underneath, a tunnel or something, but I did not hear it while I was there (Late Feb 2015). They supply earplugs.The rooms themselves have been recently updated. While the bathrooms were not quite up to the Andaz standard, at least in my King Bay View, everything is nice and clean. I ate Breakfast in the restaurant, nice buffet. I got coffeee from the coffee place, good coffee. I used the gym - small but good equipment.If you are a fan of Hyatt, this is a better property for most business and tourist activities compared to the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf or Regency. Hyatt Regency is nice, but takes too long to walk to your room. Recommended.",14-Mar-15,4
I was there for a full week on a business trip and it was very handy to be next to the conference centre and right in the centre in f the city. The staff was very helpful and very diligent. The rooms are a good size and the view from window was breathtaking.,12-Mar-15,5
"The minute you step in the lobby you know that this place is something special, the huge chandler is breathtaking and when you look up it is mesmerizing!! Every one who works there was very accommodating and pleasant , the room was clean and cosey with a window as big as the wall it was spectacular ! It is a short walk to the Ferry Bulding , restaurants,and shopping! We cannot wait to go back!",10-Mar-15,5
What an amazing stay! We were treated amazingly from the moment we arrived! Betsey did a great job of a speedy check in as we had a delay in our flight. The view from this hotel is amazing! Go to the 35 or 36th floor...the floor is a full view of the city...there's chair to see the view...OMG! go in the morning and see the sunrise! We went every day we were there...the Coit tower is nothing compared to this view! We were there for two days and we were so sad to leave! I won't ever stay at another hotel that isn't the Grand Hyatt!!!,10-Mar-15,5
"My family and I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt and I must say the location is perfect! There was construction going on on the street but we didn't have any problems getting where we needed to go. The rooms are really nice, we all had city view rooms w/ breakfast included. The breakfast was really good as well. Overall, I recommend the Grand Hyatt. Lovely stay!",10-Mar-15,5
"Five star in every way - the location, the eating places, the rooms, ambiance etc etc. No complain at all. The hotel staff is excellent and friendly - one day I lost my wallet with all money and cards etc. By mistake, the wallet went with a trouser in a laundry bag. I informed this to the hotel and they went out of the way to get the laundry pickup person back from the way to get my wallet back. In the meantime, they accompanied me with a free coffee and some snack and told me not to worry. Lovely attitude and I was surely touched.",10-Mar-15,5
I've stayed here a number of times and always found the hotel comfortable. The hotel has always been pretty consistent in experience. The wifi is free and decent. The rooms are pretty quiet. There is parking nearby and the price isn't super outrageous for SF.,8-Mar-15,5
"My family of 4 decided to spend the weekend in SF to celebrate my father's birthday. Being a Diamond member, I have been to numerous Hyatt locations for special occasions, and they have always been very accommodating. This property is no different, I actually felt very special when Kristen from the hotel called me and arranged everything for me 2 days before my arrival. Kristen was able to arrange me to a VIP suite and had a birthday letter and wine ready in the room that made my father's birthday celebration a memorable one.Too bad Kristen wasn't around over the weekend for my arrival to make things perfect. One major set-back I noticed is even though I have booked for a party of 4. By the time of my arrival the room was not set up to accommodate 4 people(cups, towels, bath kits) were setup for 2, but all is quickly resolved when I called the front desk.I would give a perfect 5 if they just put in the thought and have the room perfectly ready for 4 and also leave the birthday letter on the table instead of slide under the door on the floor. Lastly, the grand club was kind of a disappointment, it has written time indicating they serve food before 7:30 and after 7:30 is desserts but by the time I arrive at 7:10pm all food is already taken away. When I asked for some food, they just simply said nope, all is taken away at 7:00pm sharp. I wish they just serve food till 7:30pm as indicated on the operation hours, or simply be more accommodating when I requested for some food, also the selection of cocktail food needs to be improved, most of other Hyatt properties I've been to have simply more selections of food and desserts comparing to just 3 plates consisting of cookies, fruits and desserts. The breakfast at oneup buffet was very good and the staffs were very attentive and friendly so that kind of made up for my grand club experience.",8-Mar-15,4
"I have stayed at the GHSF too many times to count. I've documented my impressions in a prior review. I have a few additional positive comments:1. Consistency. The GHSF will not knock your socks off but I know exactly what I am going to get. This is especially good if you are staying for work. I attribute a lot of this to the staff. It is a veteran staff that wants to do its best.2. Noise suppression. I commented about street, construction and interior noise in my last review. The GHSF has upgraded its earplugs to the 3M brand. They are more substantial and seem to let less noise through.3. Food at OneUp. The chorizo flatbread was extremely flavorful. Good selection of beer.I recommend the GHSF and will most definitely be back.",7-Mar-15,4
"Stayed at the Hyatt for 3 days on business. Short shuttle journey (15mins) from airport.For me it's location was perfect for San Bruno, however to mountain view and Cupertino its a steep uber fare. Not hotels fault.Room was clean tidy and main communal areas were well kept.The bar restaurant menu was limited and I ended up eating at the American diner just outside front doors for next 2 nights.Good free wiFi reception in room and communal areas.Staff all pleasant and helpful.Would stay again.",6-Mar-15,4
I stayed here back in 2012. I was here for a work conference. Stayed here for a few nights. At the time they were going through renovation. The rooms were clean and the staff was courteous. I remembered I needed to warm something up. So I called the front desk to inquire if they had a microwave that I could use. They said they will look for one. So I was expecting to get out of my room to use it. Instead a moment later there was a knock on the door. It was a microwave! They brought one to my room and plugged it in for me. That's going beyond! The hotel location is great. Within steps I'm at shopping central with all the big name store. I loved it! Look forward coming back here to see the new reno! ,5-Mar-15,4
"Right off Union Square, (so you are on the flat) The Grand Hyatt Hotel is right downtown, close to all major shops... right behind the Hotel you can take the famous San Francisco cable car right down to the fisherman's wharf (6$ per ticket) super fan and a great experience.The wifi is strong all through out the hotel, the rooms are adequate, decent size.If you stay in the club floor you have access to the club lounge on the 32 floor, where you can enjoy complementary breakfast, snacks and happy hour.the gym is small but well equipped.The concierge ""Elaine"" was wonderful and super helpful, she arranged all of our tours, dinner reservation, car rental with driver and gave us great tips to where to go for wine tasting, so Thank you.Enjoy drinks and live music at the bar, a level above reception.",4-Mar-15,4
Our business conference was held at the Grand Hyatt. What a wonderful hotel and staff! The conference rooms were very comfortable with excellent food and service. It is in a good location for restaurants and shopping.,4-Mar-15,5
"I liked the service and responsiveness of all the staff I interacted with here. From being greeted at the door, to a rapid check-in, to having the blinds adjusted within 10 minutes of our request and the convenience of leaving our bags securely with them after check out due to a late night flight. There is some seriously noisy construction going on next door at the moment so I'd recommend requesting a room on the opposite side.Fortunately we were not at all disturbed by it given Sunday's off and the high floor... which offered a really nice view and the blinds were remote controlled by a button by the bedside... fun! We had a great night's sleep with bedding and linens that were fabulous as was the mattress. Bathroom updated but older tub/shower... decent water pressure, abundant hot water, adequate basic toiletries and luxuriously thick towels. Overall a very comfortable stay surrounded by friendly top-notch service :) and conveniently accessible via BART if you're travelling light.",3-Mar-15,4
"Stayed from 21st-24th Feb, 2015 in a club room. Unfortunately our stay was nothing short of terrible. It started at check in when we were told that we had 2 x doubles (not the king requested) and as they were completely booked had no other options except perhaps to downgrade to a lower floor the next day IF a King room became available. I accepted this as there was no room for movement. We had a club room on the 34th floor and I will say the view was nice. The room.......though obviously recently refurbished didn't have a luxurious feel at all, instead felt like a cheap renovation to bring it into the 21st century. Ok maybe a little harsh but I had spent the last 4 weeks staying in 5 star Hotels and this wasn't even close to standard. Perhaps the hoards of people for an Indian wedding down in the lobby didn't help the cause! The club lounge itself was tiny and over crowded and never have I had to pay for an alcoholic beverage in any other club lounge. Given the rate I had paid per night for this Hotel I was expecting a whole lot more! I had stayed previously at the Pan Pacific (now the Marriott) a block away and wished that I hadn't strayed from a well familiar path. Our first night's sleep was abruptly cut short at 2.45am by the guests staying in the suite next door to us. We had an adjoining room which transported the noise from what seemed to be at least 10-15 people straight in to our room! Hearing every word being spoken these guests are from the wedding that I had seen earlier. I ring down to front desk and request security to take care of the noise immediately. Within 20 mins or so all is quiet. The hotel advised that the guests would be checking out that day but unfortunately that was not the case. The 2nd night we are once again jolted awake by the unruly guests and their entourage of friends. I ring down to front desk at 1am and request security to break up the party. The woman whom I spoke to offered a free breakfast or dinner and I explained that I was unable to negotiate as was tired and very upset of the disruption for a 2nd time. Security were quick to act and we were able get back to sleep. I visit the front desk in the morning and am assured that the wedding party would definitely be checking out that day and we would have an uninterrupted sleep. On our last night once again we are awoken but this time it is approx 11.15pm and it now Housekeeping who are the cause. We put up with the noise for close to 30mins but the noise becomes unbearable with vacuuming, clanking, people talking loudly, banging on the walls. My partner rings down to reception at 11:45pm and requests the cleaners to stop of which occurs some 10 mins or so later. This Hotel was a huge disappointment and our stay was not pleasant. What a shame to end a 5 week holiday like this! I have submitted a complaint to the front desk on check out and I eagerly await a response to our extremely woeful experience. My advice is to stay elsewhere as you certainly do not get what you pay for.",1-Mar-15,1
"A very good hotel right behind Union Square. Nice location, good views from the hotel, clean rooms. Hotel staff very courteous, typical of Hyatt properties across.. Few minutes walk to China Town, Market St and all the famous landmarks in SF City.",1-Mar-15,4
Contemporary hotel in the heart of Union Square. Speedy check in. Great spacious rooms. We had interconnecting rooms. Very clean and modern with a degree of sophistication. Overlooking Union Square. There was a little construction noise and the sound of wind from the expansive windows but acceptable from a major city. Beautiful modern bathrooms. Breakfast was a little sparse and a bit mess but was ok to kick start the morning. Concierge were very helpful. Car parking is available nearby for an extra charge. Hired a car for the last day so that we could travel to Muir Woods and then to the airport. Enjoyed our comfortable stay in this busy city.,1-Mar-15,4
This was a great hotel. Everything looked new and refurbished and the staff all seemed wonderful. We had a great room with an excellent view of both the city and the bay. We had a rental car so we parked across the street at the Stockton Garage which was a cheaper bet than the hotel. It was about $28 for 24 hours. The location seemed good but we were looking for a few bars or pubs to get a late afternoon drink and struggled. I am unsure if there's just not a lot of bars by the hotel or if we just missed them. Overall though it was safe and I'd definitely stay there again!,1-Mar-15,5
"After reading many reviews about hotels in San Francisco, and taking into consideration that we wanted to make sure that we stayed in a safe and centric area because we were traveling with our 9 yr old son, we finally decided to stay in the Club Level section of this hotel and boy am I glad we did. This modern and elegant hotel is conveniently located in Union Square near many different designer stores and walking distance to the Pier, Fisherman's Wharf, Financial District, Westfield Mall, Restaurants, etc. Guest services on the main level of the hotel assisted us with the reservation of a couple of tours which made the process quick and simple. We would have breakfast every morning at the Club Level Lounge, in the afternoon a freshly baked cookie and in the evenings a snack or dessert...special thanks to Jerry and Jerry, as well as the rest of the staff who make the lounge a great place to kick back and relax throughout the day. The hotel restaurant One Up is also a very good option for getting something to eat at any time of the day. The rooms are very nicely decorated with modern amenities. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco because our stay was excellent.",28-Feb-15,5
"Staying at this hotel from 26-28th Feb, and all I can say it was perfect! We got a super affordable price (include breakfast). Arrived in the lunch time and there was someone waiting for us to take our luggages, ugh first class service. We checked in, someone welcomed us so friendly and cheerful, she made my day back then for her cheerfulness. We got room on the 7th floor, it was quite quiet although there was a renovation going on in union square! Bed was comfortable and big, the room was quite spacey, ambient lighting, sleek interior.Breakfast was great, although they kinda lack of variety, but the taste covered it up. definitely going to choose this hotel again! Ps, it's only 1 minute walking from union square. ",27-Feb-15,5
Really nice hotel in a fantastic location. It's a short walk to market street or a 10 minute tram ride down to the piers.The view from the upper floor rooms is fantastic and it's nice to be away from the street noise. Rooms have pretty standard free wifi that can get frustrating but it's a million times better than the exorbitant rates that some hotels charge.The breakfast is good quality and the service is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place for your stay in San Fran,26-Feb-15,4
"Gets the job done! Attentive, knowledgeable, highly competent staff. I managed a major, complex event work event here in November 2014 -- the Hyatt team made it seamless, (relatively) stress-free, and very very successful. Perfect venue for a business meeting and great, central location for out of town guests. We would definitely go back.",25-Feb-15,4
"I have stayed in other Grand Hyatt Hotels and have been so very pleased, but not this time.I can only review the room and nothing else within this hotel because as soon as I walked into the room, I started looking for other properties to move to for 2 nights.This room was so ridiculously small and utilitarian looking. I was shocked, saddened and depressed to think I would be staying there for 2 nights.The linen thread count of the duvet seemed to be about 150; so threadbare and scratchy. And the bedding, with duvet, blankets and sheets was about 1/2 inch thick. It was not luxurious in any stretch of the imagination. There was one picture on the walls. The room seriously looked like some sort of quarters for confinement, not at all what I've seen in Grand Hyatts. Even the Grand Hyatt in NY had a larger, more decorated and luxurious room.I left this property within 20 minutes of arriving...I stayed in a much more luxurious place for $199 per night instead of the $314 I was paying at the Grand Hyatt",22-Feb-15,2
"You either like Hyatts, or you don't. I like them. The staff is always knowledgeable and attentive, without being intrusive. The concierge emailed me the day before my stay to inquire about any special requests. This particular Hyatt is right off Union Square, so for us, it was about location on this particular trip. The thing I don't like about this Hyatt is what I don't like about every hotel in San Francisco...parking is ridiculously expensive. It's not really Hyatt's fault, it's just the market in SF. Here's where Hyatt shines. Right on their website they suggest the public garage across the street that was $25 a night cheaper than the hotel parking. Nice touch.",20-Feb-15,5
"This hotel has one of the best locations in San Francisco. If you don't mind walking, it gives you a chance to see so much more than just the Fisherman's Wharf tourist traps. Chinatown is right next door, the Ferry Building and Saturday Market not much further, even a walk down Haight is doable on foot. A huge assortment of great bars and restaurants are very close. And if you must see Fisherman's Wharf, you can walk there as well. The view we had from our room was great, overlooking the city and surrounding hills. And the rooms themselves are fantastic. Very modern, luxurious and romantic. Lots of automation (lights/blinds), reliable Wifi, and large LCD TV. The club lounge was nice, with some decent food options, typical of other Hyatts I've been at. This hotel will certainly be at the top of my list when I want to explore downtown San Francisco.",20-Feb-15,4
"Although the location is perfect and the hotel is well presented but we were offered rooms facing a 24 hour construction site. There was no prior warning and no explanation and when we asked to change rooms, they said the entire hotel was full... not only that but the staff had a very nonchalant attitude and just said they can't be cognizant of what goes on next door, which is less than 10 ft away. This was unhelpful and uncaring. ",18-Feb-15,4
"My wife and I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt over valentines day. This is our second visit to this hotel. It is very well located and convenient to great restaurants, China Town and other activities at the Union Square area downtown. Public transportation is close and convenient. The hotel facilities are very nice and rooms clean. Concierge services are very courteous and helpful.Most notable, we encountered a problem with noise that was out of the hotels control with a room adjoining ours. To the credit of management, this issue was completely resolved in a very satisfactory manner and dealt with in a courteous and professional manner. Well done Jessica and your response is a credit to you and the hotel. We will be back!! Thanks again!",18-Feb-15,5
"Nice hotel, well located in the financial district downtown. My room was on the 18th floor and had a pretty cool view of the city (facing Union Square). The room itself was very clean, spacious, new, and overall well appointed (with some nice gadgets and connectivity). Wifi was free and fast, and overall was good. On my particular stay they warned me that construction at street level (building a subway?) would be potentially annoying and offered to put me on the other side, which I said would not be an issue. In the end, during the day you could hear the construction but if they did anything at night I did not hear it. I was unlucky enough to be there during a day of extremely high wind, which was disconcerting in the afternoon when I tried to take a 15 minute nap and it was aggressively pounding on the window - apparently this is not the first time and the windows and hotel overall are designed to withstand a lot of this type of thing (or earthquakes I am told).Staff were friendly, with my only complaint being about the check-in: I had come off a 6 hour flight and unfortunately had a pretty bad headache, and the lady ahead of me at check-in was extraordinarily slow and seemingly had never stayed in a hotel before. The other check-in desk was also occupied so ended up having to wait about 15 minutes in a line to physically check in and get set up. I don't fault the staff for this, but would suggest considering having more computers + people available to reduce wait times like this for the future.",18-Feb-15,4
"Great location on Union Square but the hotel is dated and very noisy from road and construction noise. yes, i know its in the middle of a big city but the noise from the windows was more than you would expect and the windows are clearly very old and not able keep the noise out. we asked concierge for the best / cheapest way to get to Fishermans Wharf and was told to take a cab which (allowing for traffic) took almost an hour and cost us $35.we later found the cable car tram which took a fraction of the time and cost. would have expected concierge to have given us a few options.Starbucks over the road from reception is open from 05.00 for those of us that suffer from Jet lag.Cant help but feel they have missed a trick with the viewing area on the top floor. would make a fantastic bar / restaurant with amazing views but currently is meeting rooms and an open space that is pretty useless.",18-Feb-15,3
"The Hyatt reservations line mistakenly booked me into the wrong Hyatt. When I showed up in the Grand Hyatt without realizing the error, they informed me that I was booked down the street at the Embarcadero Hyatt. That would have been fine except the general manager who informed me was unacceptably rude. What was even more surprising is he learned I was a Diamond member and couldn't have cared less. Normally I am very understanding but the terrible attitude of the manager prompted me to leave this note for others to read. I strongly recommend readers avoid this property.",17-Feb-15,1
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt, located next to Union Square. The location is excellent because there are Muni's (busses), trolleys, and cable cars which all run close by. The views from the Regency Club are amazing- you can see from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge on a sunny day. The sunsets were so romantic too. We were upgraded to a suite (although we're Hyatt members), so we had two bathrooms, a king bed, and a separate living area. It was really wonderful to have the extra room, especially bunking with a two year old. All of the amenities were wonderful, from the soap to the automatic shades. The views from all sides of the building are great, especially from the higher levels. There is a lot of construction going on next door, but not only were earplugs provided, but we couldn't hear anything from where we were on the 26th floor. The sunsets were fantastic, especially with the way the light reflected off of the surrounding buildings. Recency Club - If you are a club member, or decided to purchase a spot at the regency club - we thought it was over sold, or possibly too small for the size of the hotel. While it was a holiday weekend, it seemed you had to wait a long time for a table or even enough chairs to be able to sit down and eat. The food provided was what you would expect for a regency club. Service - Friendly, but you could tell that throughout the hotel, it was overwhelmed and possibly too busy for the amount of staff personnel (particularly at the front desk during check in, even if it was hours in advance of standard check in at 3:00pm.Parking/Sight Seeing - I would not recommend bringing your car to SF. Parking is flat out outrageous throughout the city (at this Hyatt it cost $62/night to valet or a quoted $41 to self park at an adjacent nearby parking garage). There is also a plethora of public transit throughout the city and a lot of things are within walking distance. The bellmen are very knowledgeable and can direct you anyway you'd like. The concierge also has a great recommendation of traditional tourist sights, as well as the more behind the scene feel that SF offers. We very much enjoyed staying here this weekend, and would highly recommend this location for it's views, service, and state of the art amenities.",16-Feb-15,5
"Amazing renovation, friendly staff, speedy service, very clean, near union square what more do you want. First we thought this gonna be a so so hotel but they surprised us by their charm when we arrived. So friendly and straight to the point solution. They had a little mistake and made me wait for a little time that i didn't mind instead they give me a voucher for a free breakfast. Very rare service. To all the staff of grand hyatt sanfrancisco "" keep it up you guys are wonderful"".",16-Feb-15,5
"hyatt's recent renovation has helped elevate the hotel and it finally doesn't look run down. the rooms are modern, clean, and the view from the rooms are unspoiled.the hotel is located in the shopping district/union square so easily accessible too.the breakfast spread is great.downside- service is slow at the restaurant and the concierge unhelpful unless you call for their help. ",16-Feb-15,4
"Room was spacious enough for my purposes. Washroom was very nice. Staff was helpful beyond belief.The location of this hotel is fantastic! It is a 1 minute walk from Union Square. Downtown shopping is all around the hotel, and is a 5 minute walk from Chinatown.",15-Feb-15,4
"I come to SF quiet a bit for work and always stay at this property. I am Platinum with Hyatt and have stayed at a lot of different Hyatt's and this is by far my favorite. Location, staff, design and feel of this property is a nice balance between business and pleasure. The bar also has a very nice wine selection which I enjoyed after long days. For eating there is a great selection of local restaurants with in walking distance. Highly recommend.",14-Feb-15,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Valentines Day, a very busy time. This may have contributed to some of the dissatisfaction from my time here.Starting with room not available.No bottled water in room ( may be a city thing, not sure), when you do get your roomThe checkin processor is similar to going to an Apple Store; Desktop computers spread out in lobby. In summary, a big bottleneck and a massive backlog of people waiting.No sauna, spa or pool.The positive,My room was nice with a very nice ""bay view "".And with a nice bathroom.It is a hectic scene in lobby and hotel entrance:I would stay here again for a business type event.I would not stay here with a family, couple type event.",14-Feb-15,2
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for three nights in early January. Absolutely loved it! We stayed at five different hotels across the US during our trip and this was our favourite - the Hyatt Times Square was a very close second!The staff were lovely. Upon check-in, they noted we were there on our honeymoon and sent up some complimentary fruit and champagne to our room. It was such a lovely touch and an awesome start to our time in San Francisco. Thank you Grand Hyatt.Our room was on the 29th floor overlooking Union Square Christmas tree and ice skating rink. Such a lovely view. The room had a really comfy funky chair in front of the floor to ceiling windows. It was so relaxing to sit there looking out at the view and people watching from above. The window opened about a hands length to let some fresh air in.The bathroom was great - the shower was excellent and the toiletries were of good quality. I loved that the hotel had a list of extra items that were available upon request - ie. mouthwash, toothbrush, comb, etc. The bed was super comfy and the blackout electronic roller blind was terrific. The gym was decent - on the small side - but basic equipment for a short stay. A couple of treadmills, a small selection of free weights, smith machine and cable machine. The view was amazing though! This hotel is in an excellent location right in the heart of the city. Macy's in right across the road and there's a Walgreens a few steps away. It's also close to the streets of China Town. It's a lovely walk down to Fisherman's Wharf (about half an hour - but stop and enjoy everything along the way because it's a lovely walk!).Loved this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat. In fact, I wish I was there right now!",14-Feb-15,5
I stayed here at the start of January and found the hotel facilities to be a typical five star standard. We had two adults and two children in a standard room with two double beds. For four people and all their luggage space was a bit tight but for a short stay it was OK.The location is excellent being just around the corner from Union Square. My family and I would definitely stay there again.,12-Feb-15,5
I booked this due to its location as i was on a quick stopover. Amazing views of Union Square and down town from my VERY large room. Prices were a lot cheaper than basic hotels in Fisherman's Wharf. Staff very helpful and there is great diner just around the corner :),12-Feb-15,5
"I'm currently staying at this hotel right now for a week for a conference and it has been top notch. I am Hyatt Platinum member so some of my experience won't apply to other travelers but I was so impressed with the hotel that I had to write a review while it is still fresh. Service/Lobby-Every staff person I encountered was great. Friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. Check in was a breeze and they gave me all the info I asked for regarding public transportation and restaurant recommendations. They do not have the traditional check in desk but rather a bunch of small tables with representatives at them, I suppose to create a less formal vibe.I did not use the valet service so I cannot comment on that (very pricey at about $60/night!). The lobby is very modern with cool fireplaces and artwork.Location-This hotel is centrally located in Union Square and is walkable to many destinations in SF. There is plenty to do within a few block radius, but if you don't mind walking further you can walk to the Pier, Embarcadero and even Telegraph Hill. But be in good shape because the hills are killer. There's a BART station and cable car stop only about a block away. I didn't find a ton of great restaurants in the immediate area for my taste. Most of the options were either chain restaurants near the mall/shopping area or older establishments that didn't appeal to me. But I'm sure most people would find the selection just fine. Room-I used a suite upgrade award and stayed in an executive suite on the 26th floor with amazing views of the city. There is construction going on next door which my colleagues complained about but this room faces east and I have not heard any of it. The suite is awesome, like you would expect - automatic shades, smart technology, two full baths, living room and bedroom. Super clean and modern with floor to ceiling windows. Cleaning service came daily and did a nice job. Conference-I do not like that the conference facilities are in the basement and require 2 escalators to get there, but that being said, the food and service this week has been great. Restaurant/Room ServiceI ate in the OneUp restaurant on the 2nd floor for dinner one night. Service was very good, food was pretty good. This is San Francisco so you should venture out of the hotel to eat if you can. There is nothing special at this restaurant but you could certainly do worse. Room service was fine too.Gym - Nicest gym I have seen at a hotel of this level. All the equipment you could want, TVs, fabulous city views, water stations, towels, and a lot of extras you don't normally find in dinky hotel gyms.Grand Club -The Club was very nice with excellent service. A good variety of hot and cold snacks at happy hour time, along with complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and an honor bar. You could probably fill up there and not have to eat dinner but again, you are in SF and should venture out to eat... It was a nice place to relax away from my room. There is a TV but it is on mute.All in all, a great place to stay that is central to everything. If you can afford it or have status, I highly recommend upgrading to a suite. If you can't do that, at least ask for a high floor so you can have a view.",11-Feb-15,5
"A luxury hotel very well located in the heart of San Francisco. The room are comfortable and well furnished also the bathrooms. The sad thing is that they have moved the bar from the 32nd floor to the mezzanine which is souless and uncomfortable seating, also the breakfast room is the same although the food served is good and cooked in an open kitchen.All in all I will not return",11-Feb-15,4
"I loved this hotel because it was so central and when I say central you walk out the door and you are in the middle of everything Union square,shops, cheese cake factory, Saks etc. The rooms are great and the breakfast is so good everything is fresh and hot. There is so much to pick from you can have fruit, cereal, fry, eggs or what I had every morning the hot pancakes and maple I stayed on the 23rd floor and the view is just amazing I love SF and can't wait to go back x",11-Feb-15,5
"I have stayed in this hotel several times now and just this last weekend it confirmed our high recommendations. It is nicely located near Union Square. It has had a recent update that was clearly apparent in our room on the 18th floor. Ask for one like it since the lower floors' windows have no panoramic view. The top floor used to house a nice restaurant, but it is now gone and replaced by a small cafÃ© on the second floor. We had a buffet breakfast which was nice, but pricy if not included in your rate. When leaving, we called for our car, but when we arrive at the lobby, it was not delivered for about a half hour. However, the head porter volunteered to cancel our parking charge ($62 for one night valet). We appreciated that; an indicator of a quality hotel and staff. Regarding the next door construction noise, we were not bothered but try the east facing rooms for now. Also, a new change: free wifi!",10-Feb-15,5
"Only stayed one night, had a 1 bedroom suite on the 24th floor. The accomodations were modern and in great shape. The staff was perfect. A smile and hello from every staff member I encountered. The hotel sits right across the street from Union square, and only a block to the Trolley stop. Lots of restaurants, bars, and shops within easy walking distance.",9-Feb-15,4
"I travel to San Francisco once a month for work and try to stay at the Grand Hyatt as much as possible. Here are the pros - great location! Right next to Union Square and a 5 minute walk from Market Street. Plus, there are so many great restaurants and stores within walking distance.-the rooms- good size and comes with all the expected amenities. The beds and pillows are also super comfortable.- workout room - recently upgraded its treadmills and bikes. Has all the basic equipment you need. -staff- everyone is very nice and does their best to meet your needsThe cons- they recently opened a new restaurant and bar on the mezzanine level. I've tried it a couple times with my coworkers and we were all underwhelmed. Plus, it's pretty expensive. I highly recommend you go outside the hotel for food. ",8-Feb-15,5
The best thing about this hotel is its location and the bar above the lobby. The room was a little small if I compare it with other hotels on the same level like the intercontinental hotel on Howard st.The best indication for me is what you get for the price you pay and in this case I believe that the price this hotel asks is too high to what you get especially with the constructions noise on the street next to hotel which began last year.,8-Feb-15,3
"This was overall a pleasant stay. The staff was super-friendly and personal and deserves kudos. The room was OK - the hotel had apparently been renovated a couple of years ago, so I had expected more.However, they did one thing right: the AC was very quiet, which is a big problem in many hotels.I do not hesitate to recommend the Grand Hyatt, but, on the other hand, there are many super (and more interesting) hotels in the neighborhood.",7-Feb-15,4
"Stayed for 4 nights for NADA Convention. very comfortable hotel, staff very friendly and great location. The view from 36th floor outstanding.Only down side was not hotel but construction work just down street apparently part of new metro? Very noisy also shame about number of people begging in town.But hotel is great and should be pleased with overall effect.",4-Feb-15,5
"First, the location can't be beat - it's a short walk to Union Square. The common areas are pleasant, the rooms clean, and the beds comfortable. But the rooms are undistinguished in terms of decor, as well as being fairly dark (no good overhead lights). Most problematically, my room was noisy - even on the 21st floor I still needed earplugs to block out street and construction noise. I'd think that with a little poking around you could probably find an equivalently-priced hotel that was a little quieter and possessed of more personality.",3-Feb-15,3
"Grand Hyatt has renovated itself into a more contemporary setting with individual check in sites instead of the usual counter check in which seems to be more friendly but, less efficient as there always seems to be a line waiting for check in, however, check in staff was very friendly. Rooms have been updated although small in size. Was difficult to fit in a roll away in one of our family rooms. One up cocktail lounge entertainment and service was great and nice reprieve from the Union Square hustle bustle, but, be prepared to pay premium price for drinks.Only complaint that kept me from giving the 5 star rating is that we pay extra $100 per room to get the executive concierge club privileges because we had two kids with us and thought this would help with breakfast and snacks as well as give the adults a nice happy hour to enjoy with the kids. Big mistake because the executive lounge was short on quality food refreshments and was always so crowded that I saw many people who paid for the service leave the lounge in disgust. This happened during their breakfast time (scrambled eggs and cereal and stale pastries were served..not worth the money) and during happy hour where they served cheese, cracker, veggies and two very mediocre hot snacks like pizza rolls. Service in the executive lounge was good but, I could tell the lounge was overcrowded. So if you got to the Hyatt, enjoy the hotel but, forget the Executive Lounge.",3-Feb-15,4
"It was our early celebration for our 4th year anniversary! :) We received complimentary wine and cheese platter! I would suggest you bring your own wine --- as we did!  We stayed on the 33rd or 34th floor, I can't remember. The main perk was the use of the Grand Lounge. The breakfast there was delicious. Salmon lox, nice scrambled eggs (not too watery like many hotels make them), pom juice. DELICIOUS and exclusive! When they are not serving breakfast they have little bites to eat and access to the espresso machine! VERY USEFUL!The room itself was spacious and bright! I love the automated curtains! ;) We were able to see a view of the cityscape, ocean, Union Square! The service from the staff was quick. I called for slippers and other necessities and they were in the room in 10 minutes or less. Parking of course costs an arm and a leg. But that is just how SF is. I highly recommend the hotel!",3-Feb-15,5
"Really excellent hotel, staff really friendly and helpful, rooms great, with beds soooo comfortable you never want to get up.Really central to everything in San francisco, brilliant hotel would highly recommend",3-Feb-15,5
"I visit this hotel again after last year's visit and I have to say it didn't move in the right way. The rooms are small and the bed is not comfortable. It looks like the matress needs to be changed. The service at the checkin is good and quick but the service at the restaurant bar is very unfriendly and the prices are crazy, one tap beer for 9$! There is a small not very comfortable lobby and the hotel needs anyway a make up. The location is great and the view high up too, just outdated rooms and equipment.",3-Feb-15,3
"I was very disappointed with what I would have expected of a Grand Hyatt hotel. I stayed at the Argonaut hotel for a few nights prior to my stay at the Grand Hyatt. Believe or not, the Argonaut was cleaner, and way better than that of the Grand Hyatt. The rooms are old, not overly clean though not dirty, and in need of refurbishing. The room service was good, but the doorman of the hotel was awful. I was checking out on the morning of friday (Jan 16th), and the doorman watched me struggled with luggage getting it into the Uber. While he runs to help a customer that came after me into a taxi. I suspect he gets something from the Taxi and not from the Uber! What a contrast to the doorman at Argonaut, who was friendly, attentive, and offering to help.I do NOT recommend the Grand Hyatt San Francisco - there are cheaper and better options.",1-Feb-15,3
Lovely hotel! spotless cozy and welcoming! Only gripe I have is the Chinese restaurant we was recommended as the restaurant was extremely rude (trying to remember name to leave a full review of that horrid place)In whole can not fault booking a stay here! slap bang in the middle of the shopping area and quiet enough not to notice!,1-Feb-15,4
"Hyatt consistently gives great service, and this hotel is no exception. The location is great, central to lots of SF attractions. The restaurant, One Up, is also very excellent. We went there on a whim when we were too tired to go out and we were very glad we did. In fact, I plan to return to the restaurant the next time I visit.",30-Jan-15,5
"The first sign should have been the ear plugs left for me in the bathroom, but it worked out OK. There is construction going on just outside of the property and its just impossible to control much of that noise. The staff here was fantastic and really seemed to care about the guest experience. I would recommend that you ask for an interior room and make sure you bring workout clothes - good gym with inspiring views. Check this place out!",30-Jan-15,4
"This is the second time I've stayed at this property and I must say I really enjoy everything about the hotel. Both times I've been welcomed with an incredibly warm check in. What I appreciate is the fact that the front desk has notes to acknowledge status, which is great when you're a loyal member to the Hyatt chain. It does make it seem like they appreciate the business when they acknowledge it.I've also gotten great perks as a result as well. Little touches like a bottle of wine and cheese plate to say thanks for your business goes a long way. The rooms as well are well sized and appointed in a simple, understated and luxurious way. The rooms on the higher floors have fabulous views of either the San Francisco Bay or the city itself. Moreover, the club level is also great at every point of the day. Breakfast to late night drinks, the selection of food and drink is superb and the service is even better.",30-Jan-15,5
"Great location! Just infront of union square and surrounded by great shops (macys, barneys, saks fifth, u name it)Great staffs! Great valet service! it was really hard for me to leave the bed. As the bed and the pillow are soo comfy!!!! Its very good hotel!",29-Jan-15,5
"The hotels location is fantastic. Right in the heart of things yet we felt that it was quite quiet. We arrived late December with high winds. Upon checking in we were originally placed on the 10th floor but asking if there was anything higher we were given a room on the 23rd floor. Even being that high up the room was fairly quiet (winds did rattle the windows a bit). Rooms are small but comfortable and I especially loved the big windows. Took advantage of the little Starbucks coffee shop in the lobby for breakfast. Made things easy to just grab and go. Although we were there over the NYE period, the hotel never gave me the impression of being over crowded which was comforting. Doormen were always very polite.",27-Jan-15,5
"My daughter and I traveled to San Francisco for her 16th birthday. We arrived late evening and were greeted warmly by a young gentleman. He acknowledged my daughter, wished her a happy birthday and handed her a menu to choose a special treat to be delivered to our room. She was super excited and it made her feel special. Thank you!The location was perfect for shopping (important for a teenaged girl) and it was close to public transportation. We purchased our 3 day muni passes at the Walgreens on Powell which is a couple of blocks from the hotel. The stop for the double decker sightseeing bus is on the opposite side of Union Square. We received a room on a high floor on the Stockton St. side of hotel. The room was clean, beds comfortable and the view was nice....not a Union Square view but still good. ",26-Jan-15,5
"Very elegant hotel in modern architeture. You would have incredible views of Union Square from the rooms. Location is excellent, as it's near from best stores, including department stores, restaurants and it's a strategic spot from other touristic sites of San Francisco. The service is very kind, excellent rooms and great breakfest.",25-Jan-15,5
"It's a modern place, great location, and very comfortable beds. There are a few finishing touches missing that I'd expect from this level of hotel like no bottled water or kettle in the room, and the bare minimum bathroom toiletries. The breakfast buffet is pretty small in terms of choice, but the quality of the food was good. ",25-Jan-15,4
"We have stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel several times and have always enjoyed our stay. The rooms are clean, comfortable, spacious and the views are breath-taking! The location couldn't be more perfect--overlooking Union Square. We especially enjoy going during the Christmas season when the ice skating rink opens on Union Square and the wonderful decorations are up.",24-Jan-15,5
"We stayed there in Sept 2014 as part of a 2 night stay in S.F and it did the job. It is essentially a conference hotel, we found it easy to reach the main tourist destinations (it is fairly close to Fisherman's Wharf) and the staff were friendly and attentive. The room we stayed in was at the front of the hotel 13 floors up - the room was clean and spacious but we couldn't have the windows open due to the traffic noise below. The gym facilities were better than expected and I would certainly recommend this hotel as a good 'base camp' if you are in SF for a few nights. If you are looking for a luxury experience though I would stay elsewhere.",24-Jan-15,3
"My experience at the Hyatt was great. I stayed there for 4 days & 3 nights & I enjoyed my stay there very much. They had comfortable beds & pillows, my view was great, the room service was awesome (thanks Marnie), the doormen were very polite & helpful, the OneUp bar had a great solo guitarist/singer who was also awesome & there are so many stores to shop at in walking distance. I would definitely come back to this hotel again.",24-Jan-15,5
While WiFi is free in the lobby they actually charge for it where you really need it in the conference center. If your building blocks cell signal it is a basic level of service to provide WiFi. This is 2015 and San Francisco. Get with it. ,21-Jan-15,1
"I was asked for my room preference - asked for a room with a view and got a corner room looking at a rooftop and no viewWhat was worse, it was facing the construction site. Don't know if there are bylaws in SF regarding when construction can start but 2h of jack hammering (or whatever was making the noise) starting at 4AM is not acceptable",21-Jan-15,2
My wife and I traveled to San Francisco for 3 nights. This Hyatt exceeded our expectations. The rooms were clean and the common area seemed well maintained. This property is in a great location and provides easy access to embarcadero and Fisherman's Wharf. We would definetely consider staying again at this property on our next visit to San Francisco.,15-Jan-15,4
"San Francisco is a city of neighbourhoods and it can be difficult to choose which neighbourhood to stay in. This hotel has the advantage of convenience to all neighbourhoods and especially Union Square, which is at your doorstep. When we went, the hotel was very busy, but management handled check-in with ease. The rooms are very quiet and the food is excellent. This is a very well managed hotel and will keep your heart in San Francisco.",11-Jan-15,5
"We stayed for three nights and could have stayed longer! The hotel is superbly located for walking and has lovely views down to San Fransisco bay (ask for a room at a higher level!).The room was well appointed, the decor modern, the bed comfortable - all you could ask for and the service superb. Recommended.",11-Jan-15,4
This Hyatt is perfectly located on Stockton Street right near Union Square and close to cable and street car lines. The Union Square area is great for shopping and a little less touristy than Fishermans Wharf. The views from our room were magnificent looking down on the ice rink in the square.The hotel itself has been renovated recently and the design of the common areas and rooms is quite nice. The hotel gets very busy so keep that in mind if you prefer quiter properties.Staff were always friendly and helpful whenever required. A little cafe operates out of the lobby and is handy for a quick bite and coffee in the morning.The only negative was there were only three towels for our four person booking. I left a note for housekeeping and this was rectified.,10-Jan-15,4
"Booked a room (direct from their website) with a view to the Union Square during my 1st trip ever to SF with my family, only to be dissapointed upon check in that they had an overbook of the same room type and at the end downgraded me to a room with no view. Yes they offered me a rate adjustment, but money is not my priority. It's the experience that counts. Everywhere I stay, i always book a room with a view. I feel that has to be part of my requirement to enjoy the hotel and the city. Hoping to have the Union Square as my view that was what I looked forward coming to this hotel.Situation like this, a hotel should upgrade the guests into a higher room category. Offering to downgrade, that's a first time for me to hear, and should have been a big no no for a 5 star hotel like this.Moreover, i feel the standard is not up to Hyatt's usual standard. No amenities whatsoever in the room, no slippers, no robes, had to call couple of times to request for few basic amenities, took forever to deliver.Hairdryer in the room was not working, the housekeeping told me they ran out of any spare hairdryer and couldnt get one from any room as they claimed they were running full occupancy. The way the lady on the phone talked to me was like 'tough luck, you just have to bear at least 24 hours without a hairdryer'. For some people like my wife, she cant go out without drying her hair properly so it was a must have item for us.Been a frequent travellers staying in 5 star hotels, and owning few luxury hotels myself in Asia, that excuse is simply not acceptable. Grand Hyatt should have noticed my dissapointment during check in, and should have done everything to help me enjoy the rest of the stay.At the end I felt like i was staying in a Mercure/2-3 stars standard. Really dont feel any pampering nor luxury. The Hyatt's tagline: feel the Hyatt touch...dont feel it at all. There was no special touch at all!!Checking out from Andaz Tokyo (also part of Hyatt group) before checking into this hotel, the standard drops too much. Checking into Wynn Encore after this experience, even with 5400 rooms operations, service was much much better and quicker.I guess it shows that Grand Hyatt SF is not prepared for full occupancy.The only thing good I need to mention is the kind service of the greeter/front door man. I forgot to ask his name, but he is Hawaiian/Japanese looking, and he was very nice and attentive to me, my wife and my two young kids. I valet my car and he was always there to help us with anything. Nice guy.I never write on tripadvisor, being a hotelier myself, and being so dissapointed with the experience in this hotel, i feel i have to share my experience for the hotel to improve this future operations. Hope this helps!!",10-Jan-15,2
"We stayed New Years Eve with our school age children. Top notch hotel!Loved the service, location, atmosphere. The amenities such as a hot chocolate station, the modern loungy areas all had warm fires going. Their small cafe was serving free smoothies on New Years Day. Nice little touches that made our New Years in San Francisco a great experience.It was a bit tight having four of us in two double beds but we actually slept well. The automatic blackout drapes were definetly used.The off site parking was a fair price for $41 with in and out privlidges. Made it easy for us to get to a show and back on New Years Eve.They are building the new Apple store next door, which when finished will only create more energy around the hotel. Great hotel.",9-Jan-15,5
"This is definitely a great place to stay in the heart of San Francisco. Definitely not low price, then again there is not much in San Francisco that is low price. We were put in this hotel because of my wife coming to a training convention. Very clean rooms and great customer service.",5-Jan-15,5
"We had a lovely stay. The room was standard but everything we needed. Very clean and comfy bed. Only downside, shower pressure is very weak. As it was cold, a strong hot shower would have made it perfect. Would stay again. ",5-Jan-15,4
"A high-end experience right on Union Square. We enjoyed a fantastic view over the square, the city and the bay. The higher floor the better view and less city noise. Ear plugs come in handy. The hotel is very clean and well kept. Wonderful beds and spacious, modern rooms. Don't forget to consult the absolutely great consierges in the lobby. Sooo professional, helpful and attentive! We had a wonderful stay much thanks to their advice and guidance!We'll stay here next time in SF!",4-Jan-15,5
"Grand Hyatt is always Grand! Perfect location in SF for shopping, restaurants and nightlife. (Tio; Stockton//Sutter garage across the street from the hotel is reasonably priced for city parking. approx. $34 for 24 hours)",3-Jan-15,5
"We celebrated our wedding anniversary & loved everything. The service, hospitality & rose petals sprinkled throughout our room along with chocolate covered strawberries waiting on our arrival was fantastic!San Francisco is a beautiful romantic city and Grand Hyatt was the icing on the cake! Thank you & we'll be back...",3-Jan-15,5
"Visited this hotel for NYE. We were really impressed with the quality of the room and also how comfortable the beds were. The hotel is in an excellent location and is surrounded by shops and restaurants. Union Square, Macy's etc are right outside.The only downside was that the lifts took forever to come and were always busy, but this may be due it being busy over New Year",3-Jan-15,5
"We booked this hotel after a not so great stay at an neighboring hotel. The Hyatt was great! Beautiful hotel, well appointed rooms, great view of the bay. Check in was smooth, we were greeted every time we walked through the door. Bell man was helpful and professional. The only downfall was the bar. The staff was not of the came caliber as the rest of the hotel. But even with that it did not diminish our stay. We would definitely stay here again (just not go to the bar)Thank you Hyatt for making the last day of our vacation WONDERFUL!",1-Jan-15,5
"We stayed here over the weekend and the location is great. It is practically inside Union Square and is perfect to get to shopping (the huge Macy's and a Westfield mall are right down the street), the Trolley cars, and Powell Street with tons of restaurants. The hotel itself is pretty modern but very nice. All of the employees we met were great and everyone was very helpful and accommodating. They upgraded us to a club room which had hardwood floors and a great view. It was really comfortable, although it was a little small. There was a refrigerator and coffee maker in the room which was nice. We never had to wait too long for the elevators, although sometimes we had to stop at many floors. We were also given a free coupon for the coffee cart downstairs which was really nice. They also had free WiFi, and as a Platinum member we got an upgrade in speed. Overall, it is a really great hotel that I highly recommend. If you want a good, downtown San Francisco experience, I would definitely try the Hyatt.",30-Dec-14,5
"Similar story to last year. Great location. Wonderful hotel. Some big misses on service though.At checkin I asked for the food & bev amenity (had a very nice charcuterie plate and a bottle of wine last Christmas on a previous award stay as a Hyatt Diamond) and was told that isn't available on Award Stays. Oh well, no biggie, got the late checkout and went up to the room. I did check the terms & conditions online though and pretty sure I'm right about the amenity.Long wait at the elevators again to get to our room. Seems to be typical here.As usual, very nice room. Nice views. Big windows, nice bed, bedding etc. Great shower. Acceptable internet. Hit the lounge. Great place. Always crowded, but hey, they offer boxes to take back to your room and the offerings are great.Awesome location next to Union Square. We went out several times to nearby holiday stuff (ice skating, the tree in front of Macy's, the giant cake at the Westin, drinks at the Drake, shopping). Took a cab once and got a cab immediately. Good service at the Bell Desk too.We ate once at the OneUp restaurant on mezzanine. NOT recommended. The food was fine, but the service was UNACCEPTABLE. Seriously, we were there for an hour before we got our drinks and there were only four tables with people at them and lots of staff. Also lots of mistakes on our orders, an undrinkable Moscow Mule (w-a-y too gingery) and other stuff. Don't go.Also some misses on requests for items we forgot to pack. Similar to last year's requests for extra pillows (we have a 4-year old sleeping with us).",30-Dec-14,4
"Thank you Hyatt for providing outstanding customer service from start to end (making the reservation, check in, and check out). The staff's service made the stay that much more relaxed and comfortable in this lovely hotel.",29-Dec-14,5
"I frequently visit San Francisco as I used to live here and I still have family. My wife and I prefers to stay in hotels around Union Square as it is accessible to many things...shopping, dining, and transportation. I finally had the chance to stay at the Grand Hyatt and I was looking forward to a grand experience. I enjoyed the new modern lobby and the comfortable living room area. A mix of modern and old. I asked for an upgrade and as a Hyatt Gold Passport they were able to give us the Union Square view of Macy's, the skating rink and the beautiful Christmas tree. Our room was small and had a modern feel including the small bathroom. (I prefer the balcony of the Hilton's top floors as the balcony extended the room.) The bed was softer than most and made my wife's sleep difficult. I enjoyed sitting on the single armchair and ottoman as I watched the cityscape of San Francisco. The door lacked privacy as I can hear the people in the hallway and I can only wonder if they can hear us that I had to place a towel to block the noice. And the door latch when the door opens would hit the light switch and this was irritating. What stopped me from giving a higher score is what I found on the side tables and desk....dust bunnies...and lots of them. And as we open the window screens, dust flew around the room. We have stayed at lesser class hotels in other parts of the world and never seen this much dust. I can only hope that this problem is inherent to our room but chances are....",29-Dec-14,3
"We have stayed here before. They have updated to a more modern look. Which we liked. However, we stayed here at Christmas time, we felt the holiday decor was not the same as on our other visits. The hotel is located a block from Union Square. There are plenty of high end stores and eateries all within walking distance. The staff was as friendly as always. Parking at the hotel is very expensive. We opted to park at the Sutter/Stockton garage across the street. It was one quarter the price. So if you don't mind walking a block you can save up to $40. We will stay again.",27-Dec-14,4
Pros(1) Was upgraded to a suite(2) Check-in and check-out was smooth(3) Great walking location next to Union SquareCons(1) Hotel lobby always crowded and busy(2) No separate drive in so dropping off car can be chaotic(3) Rooms a bit noisy(4) Not pleasant to drive to as area can be jammed(4) Room fridge not stocked,27-Dec-14,4
Hotel is right next to union square. All good shops are within 5 mins walk. Lots of restaurants and bars very close. Fishermans wharf is about a 30 min walk and worth it. Loads of tours and restaurants there. Great views if above 15th floor. Gym is on the top floor and has amazing views. Rooms are good size and have everything you need. Concierge is really helpful and can book anything and everything. It is right in the centre so driving around here is hard due to traffic if on foot its a great place. ,24-Dec-14,4
"The room was clean and comfortable, but it took a very long time for the shower water to get warm. The staff was very pleasant. The big but to our experience not being excellent has to do with check-in, which was not handled well due to inadequate staffing. Parking was overly expensive.",23-Dec-14,4
"The Grand Hyatt is right on Union Square in downtown San Francisco and perfectly located for shopping and sight-seeing. It's been newly refurbished with a very modern style. My room was a ""bay view"" room on 23rd floor with an awesome view of bay and Coit Tower! No issues with noise and the air/heat was easily adjustable. The King Bed was so comfortable I am thinking seriously of buying one of the beds from the Hyatt-at-home website. With all the issues I've had with connectivity in some of the boutique hotels in the city, it was so nice not to worry about WIFI availability since I had a virtual business conference one day while I was there. Excellent and friendly service throughout the hotel! Will definitely return for business or personal trips.",23-Dec-14,5
"Here's the thing I really battled with myself on which Hyatt hotel to stay at on my first visit to San Francisco! After spending an hour or more going back and forth between the reviews and comparing I finally made the decision to stay at the Grand Hyatt! I must say that I really went into this hotel a bit apprehensive because of the previous reviews! Upon arriving I was wondering if I was in the middle of a WAR ZONE!! It was beyond chaos with all of these people in line, luggage EVERYWHERE! No real designated lines and I had to ask one of the employees in the lobby where was the lines for the Diamond Members! I sure as hell wasn't going to stand in that regular line! Anyways after about 10-15 minutes I was greeted by Adam who kindly checked me in! Poor thing was so overwhelmed and dazzled by all the commotion himself! Still was able to provide me fantastic customer service! As a diamond member he not only recognized that but also that it just so happen to be my birthday! I was able to still receive my keys and wait in the lobby until my hotel room was ready! Only problem I had with this was it was past the amount of time that is stated that you can check in! Along with me and other guest just patiently waiting. After about 20 more minutes I was able to finally check in and Adam definitely compensated for the inconvenience of me having to wait especially with my friend being sick! I'll tell you why the 4 stars were still able to be given on this hotel because it's not about how bad it started off its about how it ended and how the staff made the correct actions to make up for the madness! My room it self was amazing because I scored a Grand King Club Corner room on the 32nd floor with a fantastic view of union square! The bed was amazingly comfortable and I loved the bathroom! The fact that my room was very close to the elevators AND the regency club was even better! Talk about amazing food and even better service the staff inside the Regency Club were so attentive and friendly! I will most definitely stay here again! ",23-Dec-14,4
Stayed here for a weekend to just stroll Union Square area of San Francisco. Perfect location! Couldn't be better. We had just come from Los Gatos with a very uncomfortable bed and were so looking forward to a couple good nights of sleep. The room was very good sized and clean with a plush king bed that was so comfortable we could have stayed in it the entire weekend. The view from our room was of the ice skating rink and Christmas tree. Beautiful view. We absolutely loved it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the hotel because of all the great restaurants around Union Square. It was just a beautiful room and bathroom. Very good sized and extremely comfortable. Completely surpassed my expectations. We will stay here again the next time we are in San Francisco.,22-Dec-14,5
"I had to stay at this hotel for a conference and I must say I enjoyed myself very much. The hotel was incredibly clean, the rooms amazing, completely surpassed my expectations. I would stay here again if I were ever in the area. The breakfast buffet is a bit expensive but there is def. a lot to choose from!",21-Dec-14,4
nice location- philip at the bar was very difficult and rude- ruined my stay- i often come to sf but will not stay there again because of him- i hope this rudeness isn't throughout the entire staff as it will make me never go there again,20-Dec-14,1
I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Union Square several times. The rooms are nice - the staff helpful and the location and view terrific. It does not have any of the boutique intimacy - but when I travel for work that is not ever what I want. The wifi worked well and the staff is always willing to upgrade your free wifi package if there is a problem. I have been upgraded to club rooms when there was availability - at no cost to me. I would suggest to always request a high floor as the area is noisy (it is on Union Square) and there is usually some construction nearby.I have tried several other hotels in the area - but none compare for business travel.,20-Dec-14,5
We were unfortunate enough to be staying in San Francisco during the powerful storm that hit California in early December of 2014. Fortunately we were staying at the Hyatt where when the electricity went out. The staff did everything they could to make this difficult situation tolerable. Kudos to the management for creating a calm atmosphere during what most certainly was a stressful time for them.,18-Dec-14,5
"I was in SF on business and for an entire day, the power was out due to a blown transformer, no fault of the hotel. Yet even in that craziness of managing an entire hotel with no power, the staff at the hotel did everything in their power to make the guests feel safe and secure. Additionally, food (deli type) was served free of charge. In a crisis situation, the hotel did an excellent job at holding down the fort. There were many people irate with the situation, but in this case - there was nothing the hotel could do except pressure the power company to fix the problem.",18-Dec-14,5
We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel recently while in the San Francisco. It's located in the heart of Union Square surrendered by the fashionable up scale stores and still a little taxi ride to the Embarcadero. Walking distance to China Town and there a wide variety of stores for any needs you may want. There is a restaurant inside the facility along with work out area. The rooms are nothing short of classy. Attention was paid to make your stay a real pleasure.,18-Dec-14,5
"This is my second time staying at the Grand Hyatt. It's an absolute winner in terms of location, close proximity to everything. For starters you're right in Union Square and virtually across from Macy's. It's about a 15 minute walk to the Ferry building (no hills) where you can hire bikes or take the ferry to Sausalito. The hotel itself is nice now the renovation has been done. We arrived at 1pm and our room was ready - very nice after the long flight from Australia. The room was nice, large and well decked out. The bed was comfy and the airconditioning worked well. We had drinks in the bar for happy hour, all in all I am glad we chose to stay here again.",17-Dec-14,5
"It was raining as I came in the door along with 50 plus other conference attendees (of which I was not a part) and they quickly triaged me and had my check-in lickety split. The lady who checked me in saw I was a tad wet and offered me a complimentary umbrella which I thought was super nice. The room is very nice and spacious with a terrific view and you're only a minute walk away from Union Square. Bed was missing a sheet and the bed overall wasn't super comfy. Shower pressure left a little to be desired here, too. Overall this is a classic four star hotel staffed by five star talent. Would love to stay again.  ",17-Dec-14,4
"Top marks to this hotel. Completely refurbished recently with great style and taste, modern and stylish. Super friendly staff. Excellent happy hour and breakfast, high quality and excellent value. Superb location for Union Square and surrounding areas shopping and activities. Comfortable rooms and outstanding views. Highly recommend!",16-Dec-14,5
Not all Hyatt hotel are the same in quality but Grand Hyatt @ Union Square well meets my expectations. The high ratings are indeed justified with 2000 reviews already.What stands this Hyatt out is its great location close to major departmental chains and short walk to Chinatown (for Chinese food). Taxi fare from airport to hotel will set you back by near $60+/-I also like the homely feel in the lobby area with a nice fireplace and sufficient places to sitThe only tip to I can offer to newcomers to this chain is to book well ahead for discounts but which subject you to a 'no refund' cancellation policy.,16-Dec-14,4
"Let me start by saying all of the staff I interacted with were very helpful and professional. However, my stay was overshadowed by a couple of negative issues.First, housekeeping removed or disposed of some of my toiletries. I travel 6-10 times a year on businesss (plus personal travel) and have never had this happen before. There was little possibility of mistaking my items for hotel provided as they were brightly colored TSA-approved reusable travel bottles. I received a pleasant letter of apology from the night housekeeping manager, but my items were not located and returned.Second, downtown San Francisco experienced a major power outage (not the hotel's fault). However, this hotel had NO emergency lighting, not even lighted exit signs! Navigating the stairs in total darkness to exit the building would have been difficult and dangerous if I had not brought my own flashlight. How are they allowed to operate?! This has to be a violation of safety code/law.",15-Dec-14,3
"Spend more than 60 nights in SF. Tried the new Intercont, Ritz, Hyatt Embarc, St. Regis.... The Grand Hyatt is the best. The gym is ecxcellent, food is good and the room are very comfortable.But the best thing about this hotel is the staff, bell guys, housekeeping, valet guys, front desk and most importantly the GP specislist, Ms. Shiroma, she is just amazing. Tone of voice, follow up skills, a polite and professional person. At the times, this location is less than the Hyatt Regency and can't figure out why.... One thing that drivers need to be aware of... lots of construction near the hotel. But don't point the finger at the hotel, it's the city of SF. I had a very bad experinice at the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo.... GM (country of origin, Spain), warrant for the ex GM... Maybe the Grand Hyatt Tokyo / $600 USD / night can learn a few lessons from SF, which is 50% less than..... Job well done SF.",14-Dec-14,5
Stayed here two nights on business. Efficient at check in and room clean and reasonable size. Free and fast wifi obvious plus. Didn't use too many amenities but gym looked well equipped. Would have liked to use top floor bar but closed apparently now for two years. Didn't appreciate having to wait for table at breakfast but sorted itself out in ten mins which was ok. Ate in bar and restaurant both nights - wasn't bad. Very good central location. Would be ok staying here again. ,13-Dec-14,3
"Smart rooms, great bar and restaurant - feels classy! Ideal location just minutes from Union Square. Hyatt quality. I totally recommend this hotel whether it's your first time in San Francisco or you have stayed before.",11-Dec-14,5
"Great 5 star hotel, for a short visit to San Francisco located in the heart of the shopping center.With a very good service, clean rooms, very comfortable beds, this hotel is great for traveling and enjoying SF. In my opinion a great hotel, highly recommended ",11-Dec-14,4
"I love new renovated rooms. Up grade to regency clubSuite. Amazing view, spacious, cleanest, I said better than St. Regis. Both Hotels are the best in San Francisco. Regency club offers best champaign, quality snacks. Great ocean view. I really suggest you to pay extra to getting regency club. Concierge, bellman, doorman are working same Hotel for more than 20 years. 4 am departure, doorman suggested us to ride Hotel limo. Only $5 different from local taxi. So relax. We had wonderful 12 hours stay.",11-Dec-14,5
"I've been to the Grand Hyatt Hotel during a business trip in San Francisco and stayed there for 6 nights. The Hotel is located right in the center of San Francisco near Union Square, what makes it quite comfortable to use it as a starting point for discovering the city. All important buses and two cable car lines start nearby and even the Muni is in walking distance.The Room was very nice and clean, the bathroom was quite spacious. Only the shower was not as much high-adjustable as it would be necessary for a tall person. Water pressure was an issue as well. But overall, those were smaller problems. The TV senders offer only american TV stations.The food was of good quality and I've used the restaurant for breakfast and one time the in-room dining. From a European perspective: the buffet could offer a much broader varietyOverall: I like the Hotel and I can definitely recommend it to you from my perspective.",10-Dec-14,5
"I stayed here for a large event that was held at Moscone center. The Grand Hyatt is centrally located, comfortable and clean. I ordered a light dinner in my room on the first night and it was very good. The staff was helpful and friendly. The Starbucks coffee in the lobby was very handy -- only open in the morning though.I would certainly stay here again on business.",10-Dec-14,4
"I have stayed in many hotels in the San Francisco area and been really impressed with the customer service at this hotel. EVERYONE in the hotel is nice, friendly, and accommodating. Paul at the front desk was outstanding and everyone else I encountered from the door greeter to food hospitality have been more than helpful. The rooms are nice and clean and the location is perfect for shopping around Union Square. I would highly recommend this hotel while visiting San Fran.",9-Dec-14,5
"When I stayed this hotel before, I loved it. I came back again. This is a nice hotel with Hyatt standard. I enjoyed my stay. This time, it seems there was a big event at the hotel. I had to wait for a line to check in for 15 minutes. Later I saw a line of check in guests goes outside of the hotel. This is ridicurous. Because of that, a kind of small lobby as Grand Hyatt, I had to wait for a line to get an elevator for 5 minutes, packed with people all over, over crowded club lounge, etc. I hope it was because of the busy situation, I hope they have not changed their service standard.",9-Dec-14,4
"We arrived with a confirmed reservation at 4:20 yesterday afternoon, Saturday. Check in time is 3:00. The first thing the receptionist told us was that he could offer us a room at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf or Hyatt Embarcadero. We said no thanks. We had chosen this Hyatt because of its proximity to our dinner engagement. After registering us, he said the room wasn't ready. We were due at dinner in a little over an hour and wanted to clean up and dress. He went somewhere to check further. After about ten minutes, he returned and told us that there might be a room ready at 6:30. I said that was not acceptable - that we had a confirmed reservation and that check out time is noon. That there was no reasonable excuse for our room not being ready. His response was something like Hyatt Gold members checking out at 2:00 Platinum members checking out at 3:00, etc. Not being so privileged ourselves, we were simply stuck. While this was happening to us, two other couples trying to register were also being told that there was no room ready for them either. One couple was told their room might be ready at 10:00 p.m. We canceled our reservation and walked out. As luck would have it, we got a great room up the street at another hotel for less than half the Hyatt price. We'll never stay in a Hyatt anywhere again after this kind of shoddy treatment, andI hope whoever is reading this doesn't either.",7-Dec-14,1
"Firstly the location of this hotel is unbeatable! It's right on Union Square! That automatically puts all the hottest shopping and nightlife in San Fran in close proximity. It's a stone's throw from - well - everywhere! China Town is a 5 minute walk. The hotel itself is a grand affair with a 35 storey tower. From my room on the 20th Floor, I could see almost the whole of the city right up to the 101 off-ramps and the residential neighborhoods beyond! At night, the twinkling lights and in the morning, the mist rolling down from across the Golden Gate are sights to behold!The hotel has all the standard comforts including multiple restaurant options, gyms and fitness options et al. The room too was quite comfortable with a King bed, large LED TV etc.",7-Dec-14,4
"Great views from the rooms and lounge/bar. Rooms are decently sized and the staff is friendly. Pet friendly is a major plus and with its close proximity to Union Square its location is pretty good. The only slight minus I can think of is that the rooms have a sliding glass door to the bathroom. I was traveling solo, however it wouldn't provide the most privacy if you were traveling with someone else, again not really a big deal for some.",6-Dec-14,4
"The Grand Hyatt is a superb hotel, with everything one would expect. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. HOWEVER, when will top-rated hotels finally understand that full speed internet connections should be free? I can get free wifi almost anywhere; heck, even McDonald's has it for free. But fancy hotels will charge you every day. They MIGHT give you free , slow connections, but if you want speed, you must pay.In fairness, this is not a dig at the Grand Hyatt, but at a pervasive policy I've found at many ""better"" hotels, and I don't know why they don't ""get it"".But the Grand Hyatt was terrific, really. Staff was most pleasant! Food was good, room was clean, view was terrific. Stay there, really.",5-Dec-14,4
"I stayed here for 4 nights in September. It's in a great location for Union Square and all the great shops. It's really central for shopping and for boarding any trams and buses. The hotel was very clean and we even had champagne upon arrival. The rooms are very spacious and quite quiet considering it's central location. We were located on the 4th floor. The bar area is a fabulous place to get a drink after a busy day exploring the city and its sights. Would I stay here again? Yes, it would be one of my first choices.",5-Dec-14,5
"I have stayed at downtown hotels about 20 times this year so far â€“ mostly at Starwood and Hilton properties. Recently decided to try Hyatt and the Grand Hyatt is BY FAR the most stylish & elegant property I've enjoyed.The rooms have a clean modern design, everything in this property is new, it doesn't feel mobbed even though it is a large hotel, the amenities in the rooms are pretty nice, staff is very pleasant, I am completely satisfied. Someone always posted at the front door, holding it open for you. Just a very nice, upscale experience. If you come to SF a lot and expect some decent ambience out of a business hotel at this price point -- try this one out.Amenities for diamonds - the lounge - are top notch. Great breakfast spread, wonderful service, a guy working the lounge remembered my name from one day to the next...really impressive, and an cheap, make-your-own-drink honor bar (I think $4/drink?) Amazing.Love this place, hope to become a regular.",5-Dec-14,5
"We stayed for 3 nights. Our room was very comfortable and quite. The hotel has some wonderful staff and we would like to thank David the concierge for his help and Maria at reception such a lovely and polite young lady. The cafe in the lobby for early starter's is a great help to anyone leaving before the restaurant opens, we were looked after by the young lady, who, when she knew my husband was a diabetic, arranged some pastries to get him through. I wished that I could remember her name.We look forward to our return some day. We loved the hotel's extra service of providing any little extra's that one may forget,even toothbrushes , the range of toiletries are quite lovely and once again the hotel provides a wide array of products all free!",4-Dec-14,4
"We lucked out with the construction. They didn't work when were there. However, get a room higher up so the street noise doesn't keep you up. For some reason our room was right next to the housekeeping room. Good thing we are early risers otherwise I would not have been civil from lack of sleep. Staff was great and the location was fabulous! We were able to walk all around Union Square and down to Market St. Fun times.We spent the evening at the Opera. Took a cab. Ask the doorman how much the cab ride should cost because some cabbies take the long route. One ride was 10 bucks the other ride was $12 and we went a different way.",3-Dec-14,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for one night as a family tradition. While the room was great, the service was lacking. We arrived at 10:30 am - too early to check in, but were able to check our bags. We returned in the afternoon and were told our room was not ready, but that they could check us in about one hour, and they would give us a call. Fine. We went out again, and received a call that they had switched our room to a lower floor because the person in our room decided to stay so there would be another delay checking in. This is now 7pm. They said it would be available at about 7:45pm. We decided to have dinner, and returned 9:15pm to find that their systems were down and they could not check us in or give us a room key. We waited for about 20 minutes, and finally were given room keys. We were grateful that we were offered two bottles of wine as an apology - we ordered one white, one red. I thought was GREAT customer service - if the wine had actually been delivered before 11pm. The wine did not arrive for 30 minutes or so, so we called to check. The front desk said they had no idea when it would be up, and that it was really busy. I called again 30 minutes later. Finally it came around 11pm - 2 bottles of red, only 2 glasses (4 of us in the room) and no wine opener. We had to wait another 30 minutes for additional glasses and an opener. Seriously - this is not a big deal, but I expected more. Plus we had ordered a 2 queen room, and were given 2 double beds. A little cramped for four adults. Overall not worth the $300 we spent to sleep for 8 hours. I understand it was Black Friday and they were busy - I didn't mind the wait so much as they way it was handled.",3-Dec-14,3
"The hotel has been remodeled and is now very contemporary and 'stylish'. The location can't be beat and the service was extremely good. I would not hesitate for a moment to stay here again. The workout room was especially nice. Instead of being down in the basement somewhere, it was on one of the upper floors and you get a great view of the city as you exercise.",3-Dec-14,4
"Great location for sure, but as others have said it can be noisy in certain rooms. On this stay I was woken to multiple folks closing their door at night. Its not really their fault, since the doors are heavy and basically slam shut for some reason. You would think with the very nice room remodel they would install some dampeners on the door. I get it has to close tight, but whoa it makes a slam. They are working on the Central Subway tunnel near the hotel - my only suggestion would be to stay on the North side of the hotel on very high floors to reduce the overall city noise. There are not that many rooms per floor - so you might not really have a choice. I asked for a quiet room when booking oh the hotels own website and checking in but still got a room near the elevators and facing west. My room 2023 came with earplugs.",2-Dec-14,4
"This hotel is consistently great and perfect for the business traveler. It's convenient to the convention center and is right next to China town. The CafÃ© Press around the corner is a must for breakfast. The lounge staff is friendly and there's a great breakfast buffet and lounge menu. Of course, the rooms are also very nice and the beds are so comfortable. you can even get a quick town car to the airport for a great price, even when the largest convention is in town.",2-Dec-14,5
"We stayed for a long weekend in San Francisco and had the Grand Hyatt as our base. The hotel was very nice - great rooms, dining, wine and some live music. The staff was very nice, starting with the doorman, front desk and the bellman. They gave us a beautiful room and the bellman showed us a view across the city that was absolutely without equal. We asked for recommendations from the concierge on dining, best ways/times to visit some of the sites and their guidance was spot on. I haven't been a Hyatt frequent guest for years but this facility put me on the path to prefer Hyatt again.",2-Dec-14,4
"I chose the Grand Hyatt because of past experience and the ease of getting around. The Bart station is only a few blocks away and the proximity to Union Square was great. Over Thanksgiving weekend there was a Christmas tree, ice skating, and all of the stores around the hotel were decorated. I could not ask for a better location.I received a welcome email a week before my stay. After chatting with them I was able to stay in a room on a high floor and looking out at the bay. The Bay View rooms are spectacular, stay in one if you can. Housekeeping was very good, better than other Hyatt's I have used. Toothpaste and ear plugs replaced, nightly refresh, and I was greeted by the housekeeper in the hall.I used the club on the 32nd floor. A good selection for breakfast and adequate snacks for dinner. But, David in the club was inviting, attentive, and made me feel like a frequent guest. I must say that ALL of my staff interactions were excellent, not something I can usually stay.Bottom line, stay here, weekend rates are very good, and can't beat the location or staff!",2-Dec-14,5
"My wife and I stayed here the weekend before Thanksgiving. Upon entering the front doors, I felt the decor was very modern. There is a nice lounge area with a fireplace in the lobby. The check-in area was not behind a counter, but felt integrated with the guests and therefore very personal. The hotel was busy and the staff seemed to handle it well. I do not remember who I spoke with at check-in, but she was very accommodating. There is a restaurant and bar on either the mezzanine or 1st floor. We did not visit, but based on other reviews the food is good although pricey. One confirmation email I received stated a 3-6 pm happy hour where drinks start at $3 and increase $1/hour. That would have been nice, but we were too busy visiting the rest of the city at those times.We felt the price was excellent considering the location. We ended up in a corner room with a northeastern bay view, and a nice view of the city. The buildings were tall enough to obscure 60% of the bay view, but it was still a great look at the city and the bay. The room was a decent size, but I imagine the regular room (not corner) would be on the small side. The room was very clean and modern looking. Hidden under the TV are the fridge and the safe. We felt as if there was not a lot of drawer space, however we managed to store three days worth of clothes.The location was the best part of the hotel. We fortunately did not have to use BART, but our original plan seemed as if BART would have dropped us off within a couple of blocks of the hotel. If you frequent high end retail shops, this will be heaven for you. If you can't get to your destination through 10 minutes of walking, there are convenient bus, street car and cable car stops within a couple of blocks. You should be able to get anywhere in the city within 20 minutes.Definitely make it a point to visit floor 36 at some point during your stay. GORGEOUS views of the city!",2-Dec-14,5
"We stayed 4 nights at the Hyatt 3 years ago and loved it so much, there was no hesitation in choosing it again for 6 nights this time. Firstly, the location is just excellent. Right on Union Square, it is near Chinatown, North Beach, Market Street, the cable cars, I even find it is near the Fisherman's Wharf (10 minutes by cable car)! It is near many MUNI lines to get to most parts of the city. Accessibility is unbeatable.I experienced great customer service from prior to check in, until check out. Before I arrived, I emailed the e-concierge multiple times on questions like the MUNI pass and making changes to my reservations. Replies were always prompt and friendly. Check in at noon was fast, I was given a room on a high floor (29th) as requested. The room was clean and beds were most comfortable. Housekeeping was very observant that I was running out of toothpaste and provided a new tube when they cleaned the room the first day. Maria from Front desk was helpful in providing scissors and tape which I requested. The Concierge desk provided me with big paperbags for bringing my returns to the UPS store, and also a huge box for packing myshopping. Check out was even better! I received an email on the final night and had to tick a box and submit to receive my final bill. The bill was accurate and there was no need to queue up and check out the following morning.A few things which may be helpful to you:1) The hotel wifi is free and fast enough for FaceTime, surfing the net2) There is a computer at the reception where you need to provide your credit card and are allowed 15 minutes and 5 B&W pages every 24 hours for free.3) Receiving packages at the hotel costs US$5 per package. If you are shopping from Amazon, I highly recommend sending to the Baileys Locker at 7-11 just 1 block away. It is free. Amazon tends to split up shipments into many boxes and you will be charged US$5 for every package received at the Hyatt. I had 9 boxes at Baileys the first day I arrived. I'm happy to share more about ordering from Amazon using Prime shipping, drop me a line. There is a UPS store 2 blocks away on Sutter for shipping returns to Amazon for free, Shopping is my passion.4) Get a MUNI pass. It saves you time and money. Each cable car ride costs US$6 and a 7 day pass costs US$30. The passes are sold at the 24-hour Walgreens a block away.5) I always do my rentals from National at 750 Bush Street 2 blocks away. They are friendly and efficient. If driving on weekdays, watch out for the tolls.We will never stay anywhere else in San Francisco city!",1-Dec-14,5
"Let me start by saying the staff at the grand hyatt are awesome. The hotel is in a wonderful location a block off of union square. When you walk into the hotel the check in area is located immediately to your right, the hotel was extremely busy and the process seemed chaotic. The lobby area was very cold, due to the location of the counter and entrance exit doors.Our room is clean and nice the bed comfortable and the pillows acceptable. I found the bath towels to be on the thin side, I like a lush thick towels. Our room came with two sets of ear plugs, which both my husband and I needed to use the first night. Unfortunalty we threw them away and they were not replaced. I have been up since 2:00 am listening to street noise and people talking in the room next door.We come to the city a lot and this was our first time staying here, there are so many wonderful places to stay in San Francisco. We have our favorites which we will be returning too, unfortuantly The Grand Hyatt is not on that list.",30-Nov-14,3
"I joined my husband, who was in SF for a conference. This is to say I had no idea concerning the room. I/We are discerning, but never demanding. The Grand Hyatt is a hyatt and I believe these hotels know when guests are part of a conference. As a result, the staff doesn't know whether the attendees will be appreciative of any service provided. So, the staff sees another conference and well, the service should be the same for everyone, but who knows.Our room was great and the service was excellent. i was certain to make the housekeeping staff know us and knew what to do to make our stay enjoyable. It works. Our room was cleaned to perfection and housekeeping was especially nice. I have no reason to expect anything less from Hyatt and this hotel did not disappoint. Not one complaint. Our room had a great view.The primary plus to this hotel is its location. The proximity to restaurants and shopping is worth the stay. The hotel is not close to Fisherman's Wharf or the Golden Gate Bridge, but the location next to Union Square is so easy and convenient and centrally located to so many activities. Highly recommend for business or personal travel.",29-Nov-14,4
"Right on Union Square, the Grand Hyatt is perfectly situated and a great base for any visit to San Francisco. Chinatown, theaters, Macy's, Nordstrom, dozens of other shops and restaurants, Yerba Buena gardens, and many other attractions are a short walk away. Everything else is accessibly by street car, cable car, bus, taxi, etc.The service was outstanding, and it began before we arrived when Kristen assisted us with room selection. Check in was smooth and quick. Despite our arriving quite early, they were able to out a rush on our room and get us into it in short order. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and well-appointed. The amenities are above average even for similar level hotels, though I would not classify the rooms as luxurious, though definitely upscale. The lounge has good bar food, but limited seating. The lobby is relatively small and not particularly comfortable, and the check in uses open stations rather than a traditional reception desk, which would have been more comfortable.All in all, this is an excellent choice.",29-Nov-14,5
"I absolutely loved my time staying at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable, polite and friendly.We were in a great location, with a Starbucks right across the road for breakfast on the go! You are literally seconds away from the shops (and my personal favourite, the Cheesecake Factory) and buzz of San Francisco. Other attractions such as Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge are close by and easily accessible by cab, bus or walking if you like to explore like me. I would thoroughly recommend walking to the golden gate bridge from pier 39 - it takes a little while (it's about an 8 mile round trip), but totally breathtaking views and a fantastic way to exercise off some of the tasty food you'll be eating! (Boudin for Clam Chowder is a must!!)The rooms at the Grand Hyatt are modern, roomy and incredibly comfortable. The bed was just brilliant and the room was equipped with great features like automatic blinds, a flatscreen wall tv and a roomy bathroom.I can't really say much more about the hotel aside from it was a brilliant experience to stay and was exactly what I wanted in one of the most gorgeous cities I have been to.",25-Nov-14,5
"Though not as fancy as a W or a Marriot, this hotel has all that you need for a stay more than an overnight. It is right next to the Union Square plaza, that's more than enough to decide to stay. Close to all the shopping. Great places to eat nearby.",23-Nov-14,4
A newly remodeled hotel with excellent location. The rooms are decorated with a mix of contemporary and modern style. The registration/ check in area is unique. Highly recommend it. Value with parking is very expensive but across the street you can find a little less $60.00 vs $40.00,23-Nov-14,5
"My wife and I traveled to San Francisco so I could attendthe North American Spine Society meeting. The Grand Hyatt was one ofthe conference hotels.Our flight was delayed due to weather. I called the hotel to informthem that we would either arrive late that evening or early thefollowing morning. We were told this would not be a problem. When wearrived around 1:30 am, there was no doorman available to help us withour luggage which we didn't mind too much because of the hour. Theassociate at the front desk told us our reservation had beencancelled. I was very confused about this as I never cancelled thereservation and even called ahead to let them know we would be late.He said it would not be a problem and reinstated our reservation. Hethen gave us our room keys. We went upstairs and the keys he gave uswouldn't open the door. Furthermore, I believe the room was occupiedbecause there was a do not disturb sign on the door. We went backdownstairs, he apologized for the mistake, and gave us the correctroom key. Mind you we were trudging back and forth carrying ourluggage as there was no doorman at this hour.Probably the most disappointing thing about our stay was the room. Itwas very small and cramped. With our three pieces of luggage (twocarry-ons and one suitcase) there was not much space left in the room.The shower was tiny. I'm not that tall (at 6 feet) but the shower headwas too low for me. It was detachable and could be used as a handpiece but that was less than ideal. The bed was not that comfortable.The TV was connected to the internet which was probably the nicestfeature of the room. The next morning neither my wife and I wereexciting about the thought of staying at the hotel for three morenights. So ultimately we moved over the the Westin St. Francis.",21-Nov-14,2
"San Francisco is such an expensive city and I was hoping that the $300+/night room rate was going to be worth it. It definitely was. this hotel is right in the middle of the downtown shopping district and we really didn't need to drive anywhere. We were in town for a visit with our son to University of San Francisco, which was a short 10-minute drive away. The restaurant (One Up) in the hotel was great - excellent breakfast choices and very attentive and helpful staff. The rooms were very nice and the beds are some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The one negative was the service in the bar on Saturday evening. Our waiter was extremely slow and seemed to spend most of his time at the register. I finally had to go to the bar to get a drink order in after waiting 15 minutes at the table for service. Other than that, it was a great stay.",20-Nov-14,5
"Quick checkin, very friendly staff. ""free wifi"" had intermittent problems forcing you to upgrade to premium. The mattress was definitely in need of replacing. It was like you fell into a hole. As a result - a miserable backache that would wake me at night. So I never had a complete night's sleep. Breakfast buffet, better than most, good variety. Bell captains very helpful. Only 7 blocks from Moscone Center and one block from Union Square. Streets and sidewalks torn up due to major construction.",19-Nov-14,3
"Really nice work on a remodel, rooms are small but very well done, beds/technology/views - really nice.Can't beat the location/proximity to restaurants and shopping, also the bar on the second level - very well done, great spot to knock down a drink after a long day, before dinner, or after dinner - a lot of people there - pretty good scene.",19-Nov-14,4
"I am not sure if this hotel is new but as a businesss traveller struggled with the lack of room service at lunch or after midnight. There is nothing like arriving after a long flight to be told there is nothing to eat and no water to be located. Or when you are trying to work through lunch be forced to rush out to find something. I also found the hotel operator to lack knowledge of the actual hours/services.Otherwise hotel was great - I just would not choose to stay here, I need convienences.",19-Nov-14,3
"Pretty good experience here, having stayed in San Francisco multiple times it was my first time at the Grand Hyatt. Check in swift, room ready at 11am - always a bonus after a 13 hour flight. Room was modern and clean. Floor 5 overlooking Stockton Street, noise of the street drowned out by white noise of the aircon. Main disappointment was poor shower pressure - pretty poor form at this standard of hotel. Also they have a yoke style ball thing on the tv remote - frustrating to use at best, even more frustrating when it only works intermittently. Gym was adequate. No roof top bar unfortunately. Staff pleasant throughout, rooms made up by noon each day and cleaning staff very pleasant. Location is 30 second walk to union square. ",16-Nov-14,4
"This hotel is in a great location. Close to lots of shops and restaurants and walk able distance to Fisherman's Wharf. One plus is we arrived at 10:00 am and we were given our room without delay. While the room was spacious with a great vies of the bay it could have been a bit cleaner. The dust in the bathroom made it clear that it had not been dusted for some time. The towels were very thin and left lint on us. For the price we paid I would expect a bit more. The shower head was such that you had to be up against the wall to reach the water. While this sounds negative I would stay here again but would first look elsewhere to get more value for my money. Just a few things they need to work on to be the ""Grand"" hotel they claim to be.",16-Nov-14,3
"Clean, updated, friendly staff, right on Market Street and a short pleasant walk to the Pier. Also close to all amenities. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will return. I am a tough critic with extensive travel and this is one of the hotels I would definitely return to.",15-Nov-14,5
"I spend half my life in hotels around the world. As such I have certain expectations regarding room service, pillows and general access to food on a 24 hour basis.This hotel doesn't have room service between 10:30 am and 5:00 pm, which is useless if you're jet lagged or traveling at odd hours.The beds are terribly soft and uncomfortable, which is compounded by pillows which are the equivalent of the types of pillows given to you on an airplane. Well used and worn out.The lobby restaurant closed in the afternoon, with the only food available in their understaffed bar.Wish I had a better experience here. There's nothing 'grand' about this Hyatt.",15-Nov-14,3
"Great place to stay if you want to be in the center of SF. Close to Moscone Center, restaurants and shopping. Modern hotel with all kinds of service incl FREE internet also in the room.The rooms are very comfortable and spacy. Service good very helpful personnel who gave us good tips. Breakfast very good a little queue in the morning but no real problem.",15-Nov-14,4
"I'm not sure I'm ""hip"" enough for this hotel, but I can tell you that I was really impressed. I stayed in a club room that was beautifully appointed, very clean and really comfortable. The bath was bright and they had a lot of fancy spa samples to bring home for my wife (bonus). The club lounge was very well stocked, nice service and nice quality breakfast and snacks. The lobby was gracious, busy but a fun energy. The constant drone of dance music combined with the low-seating conversation spaces reminded me a bit of a W HOTEL but done better - warm woods and bookshelves with a running fireplace. The workout room is really well appointed and spacious, although no spa services. I'll be back.",15-Nov-14,5
"Had a great stay here this week, everything was smooth and enjoyable from check in to check out. Lobby area is small-ish and can get congested, same with the elevators, but it should not diminish a desire to stay here. Room was modern and well laid out etc but on the smaller side. Had a great view of a beautiful city where view actually matters. Perhaps the only negative to the room was the shower where water pressure was so-so at best via a detachable shower head. All in all I enjoyed it and would recommend it. Great Union Square location, easy walk to almost everything.",15-Nov-14,4
"I stayed at this hotel with my younger daughter for couple of days and was pleasantly surprised by the great service, friendly staff, nice room with a beautiful city view, great location ; conveniently located close to many attractions, shops, and restaurants. I would definitely go back again !",13-Nov-14,4
"We stayed here for 5 nights and were fortunate enough to purchase Grand Club access. The additional cost of the access was so worth it with a great breakfast each day, afternoon snacks and dessert each night. We were going on an all day tour one day and asked if we could take some bottled water with us due to the early pick up, the gentlemen working was so accommodating and even organised a bag for us to take some fruit and muffins for morning tea.A few of the notable staff in the Grand Club were Jimmy & Ahn who were very welcoming and personable. Hotel room was very clean, the hotel is located in a great location walking distance to Union Square, China town etc.Would stay here again for sure. Thanks",11-Nov-14,5
"I stayed at this place during a conference and I got to say it lives up to the expectation of being grand. Walking and taxi distance to most of downtown SF attractions, I'd thoroughly recommend checking out the awesome breathtaking view of the city from the top on 36th floor.Oh, the rooms are also splendid.",11-Nov-14,4
"Stayed here for a family emergency. I was on the club floor and expected a heightened experience. Nope. The rooms are tiny. The bathrooms tinier. The walls are paper thin. The club wasn't bad, great views of the water while you snack. But the overall atmosphere and ambiance of this place can best be described as non-existent. It's a corporate chain that exists solely as a place to sleep. Mediocre food, service, rooms. Again, not terrible, but given the choice I'd pick somewhere different any time. This hotel definitely makes me rethink Hyatt as a luxury brand. This is NOT a true 4 star hotel, so be advised, even if its prices are.",10-Nov-14,3
"I stayed at grand hyatt SF for 6 nights. Hotel is ranked as a 4 star but it is more like a good 3 star hotel. The best thing about the hotel is its location. It is in walking distance to shopping centers, apple store!, restaurants and any public transport.The reception is small and not comfortable. The concierge is realy helpful but sometimes it has only one staff and you should wait a while.I did not use hotel restaurants because many good food were outside.The room is small ,clean and a little bit noisy .Mini bar is empty. There is no water in the room! No teas either! but the Air conditioner works well.For city tours you better not follow concierge's opinion because pacific tour that they suggest does not worth it at all!",8-Nov-14,3
"I am staying here for 2 nights on business. In previous years, I typically stayed at the W Hotel, or the Westin near Market Street. I have been a loyal Starwood and Marriott customer and have had great experiences leveraging their status/points for upgrades and free nights, but have decided to have Hyatt (I also have the Hyatt Visa which I recommend because of the 40,000 points bonus and free night stay) as a first or 2nd option in the next twelve Pof business travel. This property is near Union Square, within walking distance to the Embarcadero/Ferry Terminal (About a 15 minute walk), the Financial District, and there is good bus/trolley transportation options near by. The hotel itself was renovated 2 years ago, and is very contemporary and modern with a mix of earth tones and blonde woods throughout the lobby and rooms. I am a Platinum Hyatt member, and received a 23rd floor room with great downtown views of the city. I would recommend you request a high floor as the city sounds and construction near the hotel would make sleeping difficult. The room is a standard size city room, beds are comfortable (I would still give an edge to SPG beds, but this subjective). Bathroom was small but again, very modern. My only knock on the room is the water pressure is weak, and the hot water took a while to begin, otherwise I really like the design scheme throughout the hotel. The gym is on the 35th floor but is small with the typical free weights/cardio machines, but only one weight bench. I would stay at this property again, and would recommend if your tastes run towards larger, modern business class hotel. If your tastes run to more historic, or boutique properties, there are many other options nearby.",5-Nov-14,4
"Make sure you ask if the streets surrounding Union Square are still under construction. They work throughout the night and it is extremely loud. They are not willing to provide other accommodations, so if you book here while Union Square streets are under construction, make sure you get a room on the opposite side of the hotel.",4-Nov-14,1
"During our stay of 4 days, the choices in the buffet breakfast was the same. Our room offered a fantastic view of Union Square, Powell Street, the San Francisco skyline and the mountains in South San Francisco. ",4-Nov-14,3
"I usually select hotels based on location and look/feel, and was not expecting anything special from the Grand Hyatt as overall it seems like a rather common type hotel, what you would usually expect when you go on business trip. The thing that really blew my mind and that makes it totally special is the fantastic staff and service !! I have been staying here for a week when I relocated for my job from Switzerland to SF - from the reception staff to the luggage people, the breakfast waiter to the fantastic concierges , everyone does their best to make you feel comfortable valued and special. Amazing! The fabulous concierges Elaine (and her male colleague, not sure of the name sorry!) went as far as to help me for my car search as I was going househunting and car hunting. They helped me prepare for the car bargaining, printed my documents, provided great tips and advice, etc. Unparalleled service and friendliness !This is the first time I write a review on tripadvisor, I just could not leave this place without showing my appreciation. What I thought was ""any other SF hotel"" had just completely changed in my mind to become my preferred venue by far.",4-Nov-14,5
"There are many great locations in San Francisco but our favorite is Union Square - great shopping, easy access to the cable cars and Chinatown, and close to some good food. The Grand Hyatt is right in the heart of what I consider the heart of the city. The location could hardly be better. The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby is a little disjoint wrapping around the central elevators - no grand lobby here but still nice enough. When we first walked into our room, I was a little nervous. It seemed very modern which, many times, means not too comfortable - we were pleasantly surprised that was NOT the case with our room here. The modern looking desk chair was actually very usable for work. The side chair was very comfortable for relaxing in the evening. The bed was very comfortable meaning a good night's sleep every night. The floor to ceiling windows let in a very nice view (our room was above half-way up but not near the top but still some nice cityscape / bay views). There was some solid technology in the room - good wifi connections, multiple controls for the window shades, lots of power plugs in strategic locations for charging all of the gadgets. You could order room service directly through the TV which was very convenient and we also received an email that you could order through your smartphone (didn't try that feature). The in-room fridge which was completely available to guest (not filled with the overprices mini-bar items you usually have) was very nice. I had recently had surgery and couldn't eat full meals so this allowed me to actually take some leftovers and eat them later. The bell and front desk staff was efficient but not overly friendly but the concierge staff was very nice and helpful.A tip - because of the location and the expensive parking ($62 for valet or $45 (I think) for ""assisted"" self-park) if you can avoid bringing your car, you should still be able to get around the city easily. The cable cars are nearby and it isn't too long a walk all the way to Fisherman's Wharf (which you could do through North Beach which is also fun).Great location + comfortable accommodations + everything you need and a little more = we have already booked our next visit!",3-Nov-14,5
"Spent one day at the hotel. The check in was easy and we were well treated. Our room had a wonderful view of the bay. The room was contemporary, clean and comfortable. Loved walking Union Square and enjoying the shops and the people. Well worth having on your list of hotels to stay in when in San Francisco.",3-Nov-14,5
"Weekend visit to see our son (and get swept along in post-Giants' parade hoopla!) went from good to great when the desk clerk (Wayne) fixed a small problem (needed 2 beds, first room had just one) with a nice upgrade to a terrific view. He even met us at the elevator door with new keys so we didn't have to haul our luggage around or wait. Nice touch! The property was great last time we visited, and has been spiffed up even more. Lively bustling vibe in the lobby; immaculate and efficient. We'll be back.",3-Nov-14,5
"The best part of our experience here was the friendly staff, especially the doormen. We stayed here for the weekend. The room was fine with a great view. The bed was not comfortable at all. We stayed on a clubhouse floor, the breakfast was great, but the other ""meals"" were more like snacks, and there is no food out at all at certain times. This hotel is located in the heart of downtown right near China town and an upscale shopping district. We had to walk considerably to get to the bay. The hotel is trying to be very modern, there is even annoying top ten music playing on elevators, which is not relaxing at all. All and all it's a nice hotel, I think next time we will stay somewhere quieter--my husband and I are too old for this contemporary hotel! Great for 20 somethings and families!",3-Nov-14,4
"Stayed Oct 27th, 28th, 29th. Always stayed at the Regis while visiting with the fam but decided to try out this hotel. Reception staff needs to be attentive, was left waiting for 10 minutes without anyone greeting me. I think the only person who greeted me was the door man and the bell guy. The Grand Club on the 32nd floor was awesome, great view and awesome selection on the food. I really have to compliment the people working at the Grand Club, they were very professional and attentive. The housekeeper were very friendly and always had a smile on their face. We would defenitely stay here again, but please the people working at the reception really need to be more attentive and please tell them to put smile on their faces like the Grand Club workers, the housekeepers, the bell guy and the door man.",1-Nov-14,4
"Stayed here for 5 days to attend an event at the Moscone. The hotel is located right off union square. There is a parking garage across the street (stutter/stockton) to park your rental. Also there is a Starbucks right across the street to grab some coffee on your way out. Upon entering the hotel there is no clear check-in desk, it's more like a modern minimal office setup lace where you have to check in. The lobby is nice and offers a nice hangout place with a couple of fireplaces. Another good spot is the bar at the window side where you can just do some people watching. The rooms are Spacious, Modern and clean. A nice touch are the automatic blinds (rather then curtains) and i particularly liked the overall design of the room. and it come fully equipped with a little fridge, safe and iron board. I've found the hotel staff to be courteous but nothing extra. per example: I asked about the skybar/lounge on the top floor (it was advertised on their website) but got a short answer that it was closed and nothing more nothing less.....(i just wanted to take a nice picture from the topfloor). The most friendly staff are the doorman that welcome you in a friendly way every time. also a small complement to the housekeeping staff, I used the laundry service and I misunderstood one of the items on the list and the personnel corrected me saving me some money. Overall I liked this place and i may return. But i do feel that the main-desk staff can up-level their hospitality skills.",1-Nov-14,4
"My friend and I stayed here overnight for the Nike Women's Half Marathon. This hotel is half a block away from Union Square where the expotique was held and where the starting line was located. All my friend and I had to do was get up at 5:30 in the morning and take the elevator downstairs, walk out of the hotel and corrals were down there. I'm glad we stayed here because we did not hear much of the race set up from our room. We were on the 12th floor. I had stayed before at the Westin St. Francis for the race and I could hear all the noise from the traffic and the race set up. I got a better night's sleep for this race. The hotel's decor is modern. We had a double room and it was roomier than some hotel rooms in SF. The bathroom was nice. My only complain about the room is there's only one place where you can plug in anything and it was by the desk. You can't plug anything anywhere else, not by the bed or anything. Other than that, the room was fine. The wifi was great. No issues downloading anything and no need for a password. We had dessert at the lounge on the eve of the race and the dessert was fine. We had lunch at their main restaurant, One Up, and that was good. My friend liked the clam chowder and I had the Dungeness Crab Melt. If you have the Yelp app and live locally, check in on Yelp and get a 20% discount on your bill. Not sure how long this promotion will last though. We would stay here again for the NWHM race or for just a quick getaway. ",29-Oct-14,4
"My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend with our then 13-Month-Old daughter. The staff was really wonderful and made sure we had everything we needed (even suggesting a close place to get Mac and Cheese at 7pm). The location is solid, but there a tons of Hotels in the area, for me, it was the service that would bring me back.",29-Oct-14,4
"Whether traveling to San Francisco for business or leisure, the Grand Hyatt San Francisco is the best choice for accommodations. The hotel is centrally located and reasonably priced. The rooms are updated and provide beautiful sweeping views of San Francisco Bay. Location is perfect. The hotel is on Union Square. There are plenty of shopping and restaurant options within walking distance. Chinatown is two blocks away and the business district is a quick 10 minute walk. For those looking to ride the cable cars, the Powell line is only a block away.The rooms are spacious and updated, with the luxurious touches you'd expect from a Hyatt hotel. The staff is courteous and efficient.I travel to San Francisco on business monthly. This is by far my favorite hotel.",29-Oct-14,5
"This is by far the best place to stay in San Fran. The staff - from doormen, hostesses, the concierge, food servers/cashiers - have all been well trained to deliver excellent customer service. Our room was very spacious and clean. Bonuses included free wifi and bottled water. Oftentimes, those are only available at a cost (especially when part of a conference). Location is convenient as it's right off Union Square. This is a quiet, well maintained GH property that will now become our ""go to"" place to stay in San Fran.",28-Oct-14,5
"I used to travel to SF a lot and almost exclusively stayed here because of the location. I haven't been back in years but went there recently. It was exciting to see that it had undergone significant renovation. Frankly it was needed. It is a reasonably large hotel and lots of tour groups come here. The service is good but if you need a concierge, you may have to wait.",28-Oct-14,4
"I'm in town for a meeting and chose to stay here. It is in a perfect location being close to union square and easily can walk to Moscone center. Nice modern rooms with free wifi which is nice. Only advice is not to stay in room 701, it is right next to housekeeping closet and fairly noisy with the closet, street and thin walls for room next door. Room comes with fridge and coffee maker. Water bottle would be nice. Hotel lobby is very nice and all staff have been friendly",27-Oct-14,4
"Stayed here for an overnight (Friday) when a friend from out of town was visiting. Location is very central to shopping and BART (for example, can take BART in from SF airport and walk just a few blocks to the hotel). VERY nicely remodeled. Had a nice view of Union Square. We were in room 1919. It had 2 full beds, and the room was SUPER clean with GREAT furnishing. Free internet â€“ very nice for a hotel chain. The check in service was good, and the bellmen were quick to open the doors etc. Did not use any of the facilities. The room had ear plugs in them and that worried me a bit when I checked in - but other than the garbage truck in the morning I did not hear any noise. Did not use the ear plugs. They did not have coffee maker in the room which was disappointing. They did deliver the local SF Chronicle paper to our door (so much nicer than USA Today â€“ perhaps we got the local paper because it was the weekend).",26-Oct-14,4
"I chose this hotel for its great location and the price. Being first timers to San Francisco this hotel proved to be in a verygood location. There were plenty of places to eat nearby, public transport to anywhere we needed to go and coffee served all day in the lobby. Staff were friendly and anything we needed was bought to the room immediately. My only gripe would be the breakfast area. We had breakfast included in out 4night stay and the hours it was available was just great. Unfortunately the breakfast room was on the small side and we found we had to wait quite a while as it was always busy. However on one of the mornings we were given a private room to eat in which sounds good but was dark and very cold so breakfast was eaten in quite a hurry. On the plus side the service was very friendly, food was very nice and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",25-Oct-14,4
We decided to stay at this Hyatt due to the location of being so close to all the shopping places and Chinatown. It was a bit pricey but I guess that was to be expected due to the location. You would think the price we paid we'd get a better customer experience but the concierge was horrible. We waited for ten minutes being the next one in line but the concierge thought it was more important to go over another restaurants menu with someone. What a joke!!!,24-Oct-14,2
The check-in app is great and the front desk is uber friendly. Room 1605 doesn't have much of a view (unless looking into Mystic hotel rooms is your idea of a view) but is elegantly furnished and very large and comfortable. Check in and check out was a breeze and great to have free wifi and its location--a block up from Union Square makes it a good location for SF city meetings. A very comfortable back lobby seating area as well.,23-Oct-14,4
We were surprised by paper cups provided for an up market hotel. Only 2 tiny long life milk sachets. For the price of their rooms?? We are tea drinkers and a lot of other overseas visitors would be also. We shouldn't have to bring our own milk and mugs.Concierge very helpful.,23-Oct-14,3
"I would give the hotel 3.5 out of 5 due to my tv not working correctly, super slow service in the restaurant for lunch, and bad room service one morning. Other than that the front desk service was amazing, room service on another morning was great, and everyone in the staff whether they were opening a door, getting a taxi, or I was passing them in the hall were great. Location worked really well for me and I had an amazing view. I would recommend as I feel the couple instances that weren't up to par were most likely exceptions.",22-Oct-14,3
"Many hotels boast a Union Square address, but many are a few blocks away from the actual square, The Grand Hyatt is one block up from Union Square. As it was a special occasion we were lucky, and managed to get a room upgrade to a club room. Right from the outset, the check in was smooth and quick with Paul. We overlooked the bay up on the 31st floor, the view was fantastic. The room itself is nicely appointed with new furnishings, the decor was pleasant and modern. The bathroom is a good size with a huge sink and really good sized shower, which worked well. The bed was a nice size, however the pillows could've been firmer. I didn't hear any construction traffic during our stay, but as the floors are all made of wood which makes the room look nice and modern, it did feel like there was a herd of elephants in the room above (3211) especially at 2 am. The bonus of it being a special occasion is that we received a free gift of our choosing from a list, normally in other hotels when I've seen this happen you're not given a choice and I think this is a good idea, well done hyatt. The club room benefit is that you get access to the club lounge on the 32nd for where you can access lunch, breakfast, snacks and soft drinks for free. The cookies are lovely and the views fantastic. The only downside is that the 36th floor wasn't open during our stay to take advantage of the views as advertised on the TV screens by the elevators. Thank you Hyatt for making this a special stay.",22-Oct-14,5
"Great location next to Union Square and China Town. Close to some great high end shopping. Check in and out process was easy. Welcome message on the TV. Rooms were clean. Bathroom was clean. Ask for a room overlooking union square. Close to a ton of great food choices. Walgreens is around the corner. Parking is expensive ($62), but you can expect that in San Francisco. Staff was friendly and always willing to help. received a couple of great food recommendations from the concierge.",21-Oct-14,4
Hyatt experience ...great location ...service ....liked especially the GYM ...top floor and inviting ....cozy rooms ...very friendly staff ....city centre excellent location and close to many attractions ..,21-Oct-14,5
"Stayed here when I ran the Nike Women's Half Marathon. Location could not have been better. Right on the corner of Union Square and steps away from all the festivies of the event. The hotel is very nice. The rooms are upgraded with modern bathrooms and large tv's. Everything was very clean. We stayed on the 26th floor so noise was not an issue. The beds, however, were horrible and in need of an upgrade. Our mattress sagged in the middle and no matter how far to the side you tried sleeping, your body would roll to the center. This made for a horrible night's sleep before the big race. The elevators were very slow. Overall, I guess you pay for location and not comfort.",21-Oct-14,3
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for almost a week and I must say that next time I'll book there again.The rooms were comfortable, with big beds, air purifier, a nice desk to work, and with also fantastic toiletries.Over all, the great location (you can walk everywhere) is definately one of the most remarkable aspects.Additionally, I must also say that the breakfast room was nice and that except for the cold cuts (ham, cheeses, turkey...) , that we Europeans usually have in our hotels at breakfast... the whole food variety was very wide and of a good quality.My favourite spot though, was the gym. I think its the most beautiful fitness room that I've ever seen in my entire life.So this hotel is definately a very good choice!",21-Oct-14,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in September. Reception area was fine, shown to our room and we were both amazes at how small it was for the money we paid. The area was fine, close to main shopping and eateries. Our remote control for our television didn't work, told front desk and they had a maintenance person at our room within 5 minutes, we also received a little box of candy. Our biggest complaint was the price of breakfast, continental was $25 per person, then a tip. The other major issue was the construction work in Stockton Street, not the Hyatts fault, the noise was unbelievable, pole drivers working day and night. Trucks coming and going all hours of the day. To the Hyatts credit they did offer a sound machine that defuses the noise. I still feel that the hotel is over priced.",20-Oct-14,2
"The Pros: It has a great location on Union Square, and our room was immaculately clean. It was comfortable, and the electronics (TV etc.) were excellent.The Not As Good Part: We paid a bit over $500 per night (including all of the taxes and fees) for room on the Club Floor. The first disappointment was the room size. It's not tiny (like some of the older hotels near it), but for the money, it just seemed a bit small. Another disappointment: while everyone has different taste on decor, this was very modern and, I thought, somewhat stark and cold. Further while, the bath surfaces and fixtures were nice, the designers fell pray to the temptation to go for a cool look, and forgot about practicality. Specifically, most of counter top in the bath/sink area is taken up by a very large sink that sits on the surface of the counter and looks like miniature bathtub. The result is that there is virtually no room for any toiletries, etc. It's not awful; just, I thought, an odd choice that I haven't encountered in any other hotel.The Club Room was decent but not great. It has a great view, was well furnished and was comfortable. The breakfast was good, and quite satisfactory. We missed the other services because we were doing something else, but you do have to pay for drinks on the honor bar system. On the other hand, the price for a glass of white wine was nominal for a big city hotel: $3. If you are thinking that this will be like the Club Floor at the Ritz-Carlton, you would be mistaken. However, you aren't paying RC prices either.So, while we had a pleasant stay, I think I'd try someplace next time. I've stayed in number of Hyatt hotels, and liked them much more than this particular one.",20-Oct-14,3
"I stayed 7 nights, 5 for business (Dreamforce) and 2 for pleasure. Needless to say Dreamforce 2014 with 145k registrants was a mob scene but the Hyatt was an oasis. Check in and check out was easy and the housekeeping service was excellent. The TV has Internet on it which was handy because I did not bring a laptop. This meant I could watch some of the sessions from my hotel room when I had a cold. There is construction in the area so I appreciated the suggestion I stay on the Sutter side of the hotel. I requested a low floor near the fire stairs and that is what I got (room 404). They pointed out that it was near an ice machine but I really did not hear it. It is one street away from the cable car and solidly up on the bedrock part of the city - a bit up the hill but not too steep. I would definitely stay again. ",18-Oct-14,5
"I stay at Grand Hyatt a lot. This one wasn't my favorite. Although the location was considered convenient by everyone in my party, I didn't like it...it seemed like a so so neighborhood The on site restaurant...I forget the name...was stellar...I mean really wonderful...that wasunfortunately the highpointof the hotel for me.",17-Oct-14,3
"I stayed at the hotel for three nights for business and two nights for personal reasons. The average price per night was $500. I understand it was a busy week in San Fran but I expected a pretty luxurious hotel for this price. This hotel is fine if you are paying $180 a night, no more. The lobby is cold and unwelcoming with a very strange check-in area which is often understaffed. The decor in the hallways is reminiscent of a hospital and although the rooms are new, the wooden desk and TV surround were beginning to look worn. The room cleaner was completely inconsistent. We had to ask for two days in a row for face cloths and they didn't replace the shampoo/conditioner etc. There was also no floor mat! This is a safety hazard! I never saw one the whole trip I was there (so just used a towel). I also didn't like the location but this is a matter of personal taste. The hotel is smack bang in the middle of the shopping district with no good restaurants nearby. Oh by the way, if noise bothers you, don't stay here either. I was on the 24th floor and I could hear the construction and traffic all night long. I will not stay here again.",17-Oct-14,2
"On a recent tour of America we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, it is superbly located for touring the city. We stayed on the 25th floor at the back and had a great room with a great view. Some of our friends were staying on lower floors on the opposite side of the building and had poor quality of sleep because of subway works going on outside the hotel even at night. This we understand is ongoing for some time. The breakfast is buffet style and you are seated overlooking the square, the staff were a bit brusque and not as helpful as we found elsewhere in America, this seemed quite common in San Francisco for some reason. It is really central for touring the city with the cable cars, trams and shops close by. The rooms are clean and well equipped to a superb standard. Big comfortable beds with thick fluffy pillows, you cannot fail to sleep well here. A definite good choice if staying in San Francisco but check if the building works are ongoing and what is the location of your room.",17-Oct-14,5
"There are actually two Grand Hyatts in San Francisco, so make sure you know which one you need. This one is right by Union Square - perfect location! The hotel is great, the staff is friendly, they got everything right. The only thing missing is it doesn't have much personality or any stories behind like some other top hotels in San Francisco, but as a business hotel it's as good as it gets. BTW, it has great Wi-Fi - I went from the basement to the top floor and never lost connection. And it has really amazing views!",14-Oct-14,5
"This was my third visit in a year. Unfortunately, each one has seemed a little worse than the last. This time I was unable to leave my air conditioning on at night due to some clanging noise it was making. The bathroom floor was filthy upon arrival (but thankfully cleaned the next day) and the shower head leaked half of the water out the back. Additionally service at the front desk and at the restaurant did not make up for these issues. I found the staff to be at least a little rude, with one exception, each time I dealt with them. Not sure that I'll willingly stay here again.",14-Oct-14,3
"This hotel was an excellent one to stay at in San Francisco right next to Union Square. Wonderful service, extremely clean, and near many attractions. We upgraded to the Regency club paying approximately 300 per night, which is very reasonable for San Francisco. The Regency club located on the 32nd floor had excellent service and food was phenomenal for complimentary service. Also had nice wine/beer choices for small fee. Regency Upgrade definitely worth it.",13-Oct-14,5
Just completed a great stay at the Grand Hyatt at Union Square. Staff were all very wonderful and accommodating for our business needs. The Grand Club has a very good breakfast and evening appetizers as well.,13-Oct-14,5
I came to this hotel with my family on vacation and it is a brilliant place to stay if you wanted to do a lot of sightseeing. It is placed in union square with the best views out of your window there are places to eat a short walk away and a Macys store opposite the location there is also a westfield very near it if you are the shopping type. The hotel itself is very upper class and stylish but also family friendly. The lounge area is a cosy place to sit and drink warm beverages as there is a small cafe which brews Starbucks coffee there is also fires to warm up and if you are there working there is laptops that anyone can use. The rooms are an average size with two double beds and large sized bathroom. The maids are friendly and will make sure you get what you need. The clubroom has very nice workers who make conversation and get to know you so when you enter they know you're name and are very welcoming. The food there is up to my expectations with lovely breakfast and afternoon snacks. The snacks are mainly for adults not because of any alcohol but mainly because they are cheeses. They do have a range of muffins and cookies though. The club room is located on one of the top floors but you don't get a view of the union square but a view of all of sanfrancisco you can sit at window seats and be able to have the pleasure of seeing Alcatraz and Sausalito (a small island that follows the Golden Gate Bridge. The location of the hotel is not only in union square but not long from fisherman's wharf which is a walk away with many hills altogether this hotel was one of the best hotels I have stopped in which any generation if people would enjoy,12-Oct-14,5
"Easy check in, helpful concierge staff, room very clean, well equiped, hotel centrally located- to recommand, price is ok, nice view from the top of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for people, who want to be located in the center - use taxi transfert of the hotel.",12-Oct-14,4
"This is a very well run hotel. From check in, which was very slick, to the beautiful, well appointed rooms, to the knowledgeable and helpful group of Concierge staff, excellent food and service in the restaurant, the whole experience was outstanding.Must give a special mention to Cham the lovely girl who served us every morning in Starbucks, a ray of sunshine in the morning, no matter how busy she is.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a well located City hotel, just off Union Square and for all the best shops too.",11-Oct-14,5
"apart form the fact that the room was dark, dreary and not very cleanthe check in line was always very longonce self checked when asking if i could change rooms was twice told nothere was a noise in my room that could not be fixed and i could hear every movement of the next door room",10-Oct-14,1
"You wont go wrong with this hotel !! I loved it , from the spacious rooms, the city views and the superb location , this hotel really has it all and its very reasonable rates . The staff were so helpful, courteous and friendly with a smile every time you passed the doors !! I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone . Union Square is on your doorstep and The Ferry Building about 10 mins away . I will certainly stay here again !!",9-Oct-14,5
"We had a Bay View room and it was a VIEW. Nice, modern room, bigger than expected. Unfortunately we had a bathroom with a shower above the bath with a shower curtain, bit awkward. On the other hand, it had the biggest hand basin we have ever seen and the best magnifying mirror ever. Wish I could get one.Would return without hesitation.",8-Oct-14,4
Nice hotel and location. Friendly staff. Yet they want to charge Diamond members $5 or $10 for faster and fastest internet. They don't tell you that when you check in. Only Hyatt I've stayed in that charges like this. Not a big deal but in poor taste I think.,8-Oct-14,3
"I am a regular guest at Hyatt Hotels in Europe, Asia and NYC and I have to say that the luxury and sometimes intimate service of other Hyatt hotels could not quite be matched by the SFO property. Let me start with the not-so-good: the place is HUGE, it is a hotel factory and that is sometimes matched by staff attitude, eg in the breakfast restaurant. We found a 'could not care less' attitude which is totally unusual for a Hyatt.The goodies: The views in the high floors are absolutely amazing and you will hardly find better in SFO, location right next to Union Square is extremely convenient for both biz travellers and tourists, the ladies in the Grand Club are very nice.Bottom-line: Not my favourite Hyatt in the world but a solid choice.",8-Oct-14,4
Just back from a trip here for 2 days.A great hotel with fab rooms. very clean and really good bathrooms. We had cocktails and snacks at the Mezzanine bar which is a good place to start the evening. the location is in the heart of the city and only a 10min stroll down to China Town and harbour.,7-Oct-14,4
This was a very nice hotel. The rooms were recently remodeled and I especially liked the new shower heads they were amazing it felt like being under a waterfall. the staff was exceptional and also kind during the entire stay! the location is in the heart of Union Square so it is fairly centrally located to most things in SF and Uber is right there when you need it. It is very centrally located to shopping. The only reason for 4 stars is the rooms are a bit small. We got an upgraded room with a nice view of the bay and Transamerica tower. Try to get as high up as possible and facing the bay so you won't hear the whistles from the taxi person downstairs. So even with the upgrade the room is like 325 sq ft. Everything in SF is tiny but still it is a small room. But nice. I missed having a sitting chair or something beside the beds. Overall I definitely recommend if you are in the area. Much better then the other Hyatt in SF.,6-Oct-14,4
"We have stayed here many times over many years. This was our first visit after the major renovation. I can't imagine staying anywhere else. The rooms are up to date and trendy. The location is the very best. You can walk almost anywhere--and get a cab when necessary. We were able to upgrade to the ""Club"" floor upon check in. That gave us a fabulous free breakfast buffet, and lovely cocktail hour with ample appetizers. We recommend this hotel to everyone.",6-Oct-14,4
"Almost perfect business hotel in the heart of downtown/Union Square area. Rooms are modern and well appointed. But it almost feels like they chose style over function... Eg: Sleek and trendy furniture, but none have drawers, so good luck if you want to really unpack.....! Other than that, the room was perfect. I had a nice view of the city (from a 26th floor room). Although the hotel was booked full, never had to wait too long for an elevator (they have 5 or 6 in total). The lobby and hallways were modern and clean.The one thing that bugged me was how long it took to check-in/check out. They have several small stations/tables with employees handling everything from laptops. Even at peak times there were only 3 people handling check outs at this ""front desk"", and they did a lousy job at that. With only 2 people in front of me, I had to wait ~20 minutes to check out... Paid $250 per night which is typical for this type of a hotel in downtown SF...",6-Oct-14,4
"10 minutes walking from the Moscone Center and Yerba Buena Theater.Great location, close to Market Street (shopping) and cable car stations.36th floor provides an amazing bayview. Unfortunately, no bar at this level.",3-Oct-14,4
"Nice hotel, centrally located at Union Square. Modern rooms, with electric roller blinds. A little pricey but overall I was very impressed by this hotel. The Hotel is very large. Lots of transport option located nearby for easy access to tourist attractions. Definitely recommend.",2-Oct-14,5
"Try to be cool but what I expect from Hyatt is classic and formal service and attitude.Check-in desk layout is still awkward, it looks like Apple Store but makes me uncomfortable. Service quality is random, I was satisfied with a staff when I checked in but disappointed with a blunt staff when checked out and at the bar (OneUp?). Breakfast place is small and short of food choices compared to the price. Staffs at the place was nice. Workout place is located at the top of hotel but don't expect to much its view. And the gym is really small. Overall, the hotel appears to try deliver comfortable atmosphere as it is located in SF but its staffs , interiors and facilities are mixture of coolness and classic. Need to choice.",2-Oct-14,3
Crazy entrance to hotel very well handled by lovely doormen/concierge. Staff all friendly and helpful. Room a decent size and very clean. Good food in on site restaurant. On a low floor but no noise at all from neighbours or street. Best thing is fantastic location. We walked from here to everywhere in San Fran and also so close to Market street for busses and cable car. Would definitely stay again!,1-Oct-14,4
"Stayed here for 3 nights - its located right next to Union Square, so shopping, trams, restaurants - all walking distance. We had a car but we were advised not to have it in SF for our duration as parking is so expensive - great tip - you don't really need a car until you are leaving.Rooms are great - we had 2 queen beds and they are spacious and comfortable. We had a problem of a leaky air con at 5AM - it was fixed (after a few calls) but it wasn't until we checked out and then mentioned to the lobby that they compensated us with a free breakfast - it did take them a long time to let us know and the duty manager in charge didn't really do much. Credit where credit is due though - the lobby staff were excellent and they made quick decisions there and then. Everything is walk-able and this hotel is highly recommended despite our air con issue !",1-Oct-14,4
"We stayed here for 5 nights last week. Overall a fantastic location for the City. The hotel is located next door to Union Square - which has shopping, food choices and there is a tram stop. There is also a laundromat two blocks walk away which is handy. Several years ago we stayed at a motel across the road from pier 39, however we are glad we stayed in the city instead as the pier is only 10 minutes by cab or tram away anyway. I did not rate a 5 as you could hear what was going on in rooms beside and across the hall. Unfortunately on one night, a room across the hall had a bit of a party going on until 2am and we heard everything. Just a tip budget for car parking as you need approx $60 US a day on top of the room rates. We would stay here again though. ",30-Sep-14,4
"This is the perfect spot in San Francisco and it's where I will definitely make my home if every visiting again.Check-in was the only thing that took quite a while so this perhaps they can improve upon. I didn't know how to use the check-in bar code on my reservation. Maybe it was set up for it, but signage was lacking so I queued, along with everyone else. Minor issue though, unless you're late for a meeting! :)Regardless, the welcome was extremely warm and hearty. Staff were all consistently friendly and upbeat.Rooms were very clean and spacious and everything was within working order.The entire hotel grounds were very well maintained, and their restaurant options for dining are great as well. The gym is quite okay too, but there is no swimming pool or sauna or steam room to unwind in. So for that, you'll just have to go down to the OneUp bar and treat yourself to a glass of wine (good selection!).The best thing...I think was the location. Perfect spot from which to explore the city. And you're just on the footsteps of Union Square.",30-Sep-14,5
"The Grand Hyatt is the best hotel stay EVER!!! I would definitely stay here again and again and again! The staff, to include the bellmen, front desk, wait staff, housekeeping, and concierge is SUPER friendly and helpful. Everyone I interacted with was AWESOME!!!!Most notable: Champagne waiting for you while in the lobby area, my interactions with staff and I truly love the web check in and check out. Very convenient and EASY!!! The hotel room was very spacious and has a lot of great amenities to include: great pillows, a restful bed with a great view, an iPhone charger connected to the telephone (no need to bring yours), several electrical outlets located near the bed (no need for an extension cord), the electrical window shades, green tea toiletries (soap, body wash, shampoo and conditioner), great lighting (especially the bed lights), the IRON, OMG! (I forgot to write down the brand of ironâ€_ super duper, especially when I used it to iron my linen skirt â€“ wrinkle free in less than 5 minutes), and free WiFi. But my all time favorite thing... a welcome note, with my name, displayed on the flat screen TV. After seeing my name in â€œlightsâ€ù well on the TV, I felt like I was definitely in the right place!! GREAT touches. The staff knew me by name and yes, the staff sincerely CARED about me. My last night, I felt dehydrated. I called the front desk at 2:30 am to find out where the ice machine was located. The front desk receptionist immediately said, no problem Mrs. Williams, we will bring you a bottle of water (as to say, don't worry about leaving your room, it's too late, we will take care of you!) Just a great feeling!!! I want to give a special thank you to Rolando, he knew exactly what I wanted before I could ask (a good ole midday Heineken)!! Love you Rolando, Grand Hyatt and San Francisco!! GREAT Location, People, and Environment!!!!",29-Sep-14,5
"i stayed a week on business purposes in this hotel and enjoyed every moment. Especially the breakfast and the location contributed to this feeling. Despite some little problems with the room service, which was handled great by the hotel director, everything was on Fife star plus level! ",29-Sep-14,5
"Really nice hotel, great location right next to Union Square, easy for shopping. The rooms are large and clean. Breakfast is high quality but somewhat limited in choice. We were given a Union Square view room, but I had paid for a City View room which costs a bit more. Regret! The Union Square view is much nicer :)",29-Sep-14,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for our recent vacation stay in San Francisco. We have to give the Grand Hyatt an A++. The location is perfect, at Union Square. It is within walking distance to the Powell Street Cable Car line. There are some very good breakfast locations within walking distance and the best shopping in San Francisco. The hotel staff was very professional and the room was very clean. We had a view from the 28th floor that was overlooking Alcatraz and the Bay. We would have no issues about staying at the Grand Hyatt when we go back to San Francisco and would suggest this hotel to anyone looking for a great experience.",28-Sep-14,5
As we only had one night in San Francisco we thought a whistle stop open bus would be the best option. After checking in at the hotel I called on the Concierge who was extremely helpful and booked tickets for that evening. We had a beautiful room and our evening meal was excellent with wonderful service.,27-Sep-14,5
"I have stayed at this property many times in the 1990's and it is still the best hotel in the city. Right on Union Square with awesome views of San Francisco, the bat and the bridge, Grand Hyatt SFO is the place to be.Yes, there are many great hotels all around it but this is one of the iconic hotels that has kept its charm, service and ambience to the best.Check in was a breeze as with check out. Rooms were very comfortable as with the amenities. Any view is great for this property.The executive Club is small but nonetheless comfortable. Unlike properties in Asia, drinks are charged here at a standard rate and go on an honour system versus being part of the package of staying in the executive club room.Car park is not on location but nearby. Doormen could be a bit more attentive.The facilities in the room are modern and certainly a change with time.Location - everything one needs is literally at the doorstep.",25-Sep-14,5
"Stayed for 3 nights, problem on check in as our reservation had not been confirmed through tour operator, reception were excellent sorted a room out for us and then sorted directly with tour operator. Excellent standard of accommodation and great location. One small issue but not the hotels fault was that at the moment roadworks are taking place down the street and if can be noisy early mornings. Definitely recommend hotel ",25-Sep-14,4
"We normally stay at the Hyatt, and this was another great experience with this hotel. They've done some upgrading since our last visit, and the rooms are a bit trendier. I really liked the new electronic sunshade on the main window, it was very much appreciated. The rooms are comfortable and the hotel is fairly central.It was quite a bit more in cost than on our last stay, not sure if that's a SF trend or just this hotel. Seemed quite the jump from a couple of years ago, so we may be looking at other venues for future visits.",25-Sep-14,4
"Our room was great and we had fantastic views from our room. The staff were really friendly and extremely helpful, booking us taxis, restaurants etc.. There were even doormen who opened the doors for you as you approached! We ate in the dining room for breakfast and lunch and both were amazing and very good value - not overpriced at all. The location was fantastic too - right down from Union Square and not too far from China Town.A lovely place to stay for mere mortals!!",25-Sep-14,5
The hotel is beautiful and excellently situated. Joanne the concierge was so lovely. She was extremely helpful and patient. It will be the first time that when I think about a great hotel a person's face also comes to mind. .. perfect! ,25-Sep-14,5
"The Grand Hyatt is situated at Union Square in the heart of San Francisco - we chose to base ourselves here rather than the more touristy Fisherman's Wharf area and glad we did.The hotel is big and comfortable with a typical San Fran welcome on arrival. We had an excellent room on the 19th floor with a city view - looked fab at night. Amazing views from the gym on the 35th floor - encouraged the morning work- out....... Pretty essential if you are indulging in the buffet breakfast - really good, if a bit pricey. Union Square is great for restaurants and bars, and feels safer than Fisherman's Wharf especially after dark (not that we had any fears in San Fran - it's a wonderful city) sadly lots of homeless people hanging around the square but although they can be a bit intimidating they don't generally take much notice of tourists .Would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again - check your bill before checking out though - there were mistakes on mine - sorted quickly by the front desk but don't just sign off without checking.",23-Sep-14,4
"Our room was very nice with comfortable bed. The chair in the room was great too and the room appointed with a large flat screen tv. Floor the ceiling windows with a city view. I especially enjoyed the hot water pot as I bring my own tea and the boiling water was convenient for tea. I thought the room comfortable and relaxing and I heard little street noise on the 26 th floor. The bathroom has been remodeled but they used an old bathtub which was newly glazed instead of one that was sleek and modern. That's a disappointment but the fixtures are new as is the sink area with granite top. The staff is very kind and attentive. The housekeeping always said good morning as does the concierge and bell staff. Our car was brought around quickly and they offer directions. Great stay and great convenient Union Square location. Also had a mini fridge in the room, a big plus. ",23-Sep-14,5
"Don't misinterpret the heading, its a nice hotel but grand is misleading. Its a good quality business hotel, the rooms are comfortable and reasonably well equipped.my room was street side and noisy at times with tram bells and whistles( I know its San Fran atmosphere) and the flag was banging against my window on a couple of windy nights.But for $350 a night excluding breakfast I would expect a little grander . I guess its the location that you pay for and you cant argue about its position, right on Union Square, easy access to tram/ cable and all major shopping.It also has spectacular views from the top floor.The staff were very good, check in is slick and door and concierge very helpful.I though that compared to other hotels nearby that bar area was a bit unexciting and didn't offer a great selection. I one ate breakfast in the restaurant one day, preferring to grab and go from the very convenient lobby trolley stocked with egg/bacon rolls, fruit, yoghurts cereals juice and coffee, much cheaper.Overall a pleasant stay, but 6 nights over $2k ?",22-Sep-14,3
Paper thin walls..baby crying all night. No longer have bar on top of hotel open to guests. Staying in downtown SF but very limited tv channels..could not get Giants game. Average hotel for high price,22-Sep-14,3
"Arrived 21.00 on fri 19th and was through a very smooth and professional checkin by 21.15 and pleasantly surprised by standard of room and amenities, enjoyed on outstanding bloodymary expertly mixed by boa my kind el Salvador mixologist, after doing sight seeing trip returned to onelevelup and delighted to be rememeber from previous night, on entering my room, absolutely spotless, would never have guessed was my room apart from my belongings being left as I had left them, nice touch, oh and room service prompt and polite, if the next few days continue on same vain, should prove a memorable visit, ps take elevator to floor 36, wow, still this hotel has a nice ambiance about, so far outstanding.",20-Sep-14,5
"Good location, good service.Unfortunately, early arrival truck which brings food and supplies to stores around made a lot of noise. The window and curtain can not block them all. It can be better if this problem is solved.",19-Sep-14,4
"Breakfasts were lovely, but it was the service which really stands out here. Very attentive doormen greet you and open the doors whenever you enter or leave the hotel and are very helpful with luggage or shopping. I'd stay here next time I come back.",18-Sep-14,4
"The hotel is located downtown and San Francisco is building a subway system. Traffic is very bad and it can take awhile to go anywhere. If you have a car it costs you $41.00 a day to park and $62.00 a day if you valet. The other problem is noise from the construction which is going on 24 hours a day, The hotel actually has ear plugs in your room for you to use. The hotel has also removed all soda machines and they said it is to encourage good eating habits. Well it is San Francisco. LAUGHING OUT LOUD The hotel is clean, the employees are very friendly and helpful, the service is excellent, the food was good, the furnishings were new. The room was an adequate size with a modern look. The sink in the bathroom was weird. However, I can't rate the hotel higher because of the traffic, noise, and parking problems.",18-Sep-14,3
"This is a beautiful, clean hotel with great views of the city. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there was no fridge in the room. The staff was the real star at the hotel though - every single one was excellent and friendly. Loved staying there!!",18-Sep-14,4
"i recently stayed at the hyatt for four nights, whilst the hotel is lovely beware if you have room overlooking the square you might struggle to sleep due to the road works!! i couldn't believe they went on all night - the drilling, the noise of reversing JCB's all through the night ...",18-Sep-14,1
"This hotel is in a good location â€“ right at the corner of Union Square within the downtown shopping area and a good variety of restaurants. The famous tram stop is nearby and the Financial District / Chinatown is within a 10-15 minute walk. Fishermanâ€™s Wharf is a 10 minute drive away. Service provided by the Front Desk and concierge was within expectations. Like any downtown hotels, the room was slightly small but it had recently been refurbished. We booked twin beds as we were a family of 3 â€“ but the bed itself was smaller than a queen size bed and it was a bit of a squeeze. Wifi is complimentary in the room.The bathroom was also a bit small â€“ thereâ€™s no separate bathtub and shower room. You need to climb into the bathtub, draw the â€œplasticâ€ù curtains and shower. The bathroom door was also frosted, which could be annoying when the bathroom lights are switched on while you are sleeping. And the flushing system for the WC was the noisiest weâ€™ve ever heard and experienced in any hotels. The shower was also under-strength. Housekeeping was very average â€“ several items were missed out (eg. shower gel was not replenished for 2 consecutive days, used mugs was taken away and not replaced, bathroom floor stain not cleaned etc). Requests for certain items were not met until we had to remind housekeeping about it. Thereâ€™s a water and ice dispenser on each floor â€“ but on 2 occasions, the water container was empty and not replaced. Staying in a downtown hotel meant that on higher floors, you could get spectacular views. Sound insulation from the windows wasnâ€™t too good and you could get some traffic noise, which was more obvious at night. Parking rates here, as expected, are expensive. To self-part at the nearest garage, which is opposite the hotel (along Sutter Street), the rates are $41 for 24 hours with multiple entry/exit. For valet parking, that is at a mind boggling fee of $62!!! Apart from its location, our stay here fell a bit short of our expectations, especially having to pay $400 per night. Somehow, other Grand Hyatt properties, especially in the Far East, exude not only more luxury and comfort but comes with more attentive and superior levels of service.",17-Sep-14,3
"Easy check-in with friendly associates who were kind to a weary and somewhat grumpy traveler. The room was very modern and clean, quite lovely. Stayed on the 7th floor, no noise. Location...one of the best.",17-Sep-14,5
"I give it 4 and a half stars overall. Nice room, recently remodeled. Small, but as expected for SF. Comfortable bedding. Check in and out was very fast for me, although others reviewers apparently had some difficulty. Standard room, 2 doubles, which came with in room fridge which was nice. All staff were friendly except for one of the female concierges. She answered the phone twice while I was talking to her, acted like she couldn't be bothered to help me with directions. I guess I should have pulled out my cell phone to talk to her. The other concierges were very helpful, however, and I think she is an outlier. There was some street noise, but not much different from other SF hotels I have stayed at. I would stay here again.",16-Sep-14,5
I arrived with my family for 5 days for a meeting. Prompt check in and great location. All staff well trained and courteous. Recently remodeled and clean. The hotel has a good gym with great view.Good concierge. Really it was a no hassle stay!,16-Sep-14,4
"Ok so maybe I expect to much of the check in clerk, a little welcome and a smile rather than an abrupt 'name' and not even a please or thank you in site then to be thrust a piece of paper and told $75 to upgrade so you can use the bar at the top of the hotel, excuse me you want me to pay to use the bar in a hotel! After that I then tried to use the one small bar in the hotel and again very rude and abrupt bar tender then to be charged $22 for a wine and a small beer..I really thought we would get better service from a $400\ night hotel. I must admit I would never stay there again and would highly recommend Hyatt to train their staff in customer service skills.I have a booking at another Hyatt hotel for Christmas and the new year but based on this experience I my think twice about that booking",14-Sep-14,1
We love Hyatt and are never disappointed with them. While visiting San Francisco we got a suite on the 20th floor with great views. The room was great and spacious. King size bed was very comfortable. Bathrooms were nice and shower had good water pressure. Bell hops and valet attendants were all wonderful. We bought access to the club level which was so nice with beautiful views and great staff. It's nice to have a place to just unwind and relax or start the day with coffee overlooking San Francisco. Wi-FI is reliable. They have a fridge in the room but no mini bar or bottled waters in the room. It's a nice location but not really in walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf but is in the heart of the shopping district. There are plenty of great restaurants nearby as well.,14-Sep-14,5
I stayed at that hotel while visiting the vmworld convention and it was a really great choice. It is only a short walk to wherever one might want to go. I had a great room nearby the Grand Hyatt Club lounge. The staff did a marvelous job. I really felt welcomed there. My choice for my future visits to San Francisco!,14-Sep-14,5
"We have stayed here in the past and given it a great review, but not this time. First of all the check in was very strange and unprofessional. There were two agents sitting at a table out in the middle of the room with guests lined up into the entry trying to check in. It reminded me of the return lines after Christmas. They didn't greet us as Hyatt Gold Passport members and did not go out of their way to help with our questions. The worst part of the stay was the noise from the construction outside the hotel (not the hotels fault). Jackhammers and pile drivers worked ALL night. The noise would wake us up every 10 minutes with a huge BOOM and the sound of rock being loaded in trucks. This may be the same at all hotels near Union Square. I have never given another Hyatt a poor review.",14-Sep-14,2
"Stayed 4 nights at this hotel. Booked and paid In advance directly with the hotel, for a Bay View King Suite on a high floor. Upon check in the agent had us in the 19th floor which is the lowest for this room type and when we recomfirmed a bay view king on a high floor he said oh ya and put us up one floor to the 20th what is that? When we reached our room NO bay view it was a city view. So glad we booked so far in advance to not get what we paid for on any level. On a positive note the location is great !",12-Sep-14,3
This hotel is lovely. The moment you walk in you think wow. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The staff are helpful and the bar is decent although a touch overpriced. The location is wonderful - and the area felt very safe and we were able to walk around at night without worrying. The hop on hop off bus stop was just a block or 2 away. Would defiantly recommend staying here.,11-Sep-14,4
"We spent 4 nights at the Hyatt SF. We had purchased our package through priceline and it included breakfast. Unfortunately, we didn't read the small print on the breakfast receipt that said tip had already been included with the breakfast package and we had ended up overtipping the breakfast room staff with an extra 20% tip plus the 15% tip included in the check. The location of the hotel is convenient and the staff were helpful and friendly. Our main issue was at checkout when the front desk noticed several questionable charges from their restaurant on our bill. The front desk deducted those charges and left with what I thought was my final bill, until I got my credit card statement and noticed they had charged me for a breakfast and a tax that was not included in my final bill. I called Hyatt to straighten the bill out and they deducted the breakfast charge, but I've never encountered this much problem with a hotel bill that had to be corrected two times because of of incorrect charges.Would I stay here again? Probably not.",10-Sep-14,3
"We spent two nights here & found the service & hotel in general to be ideal for us. We wished we had allowed ourselves a few more nights. Great spot, good range of meals, quick breakfast & coffee option in the foyer which we used both mornings for speed & convenience. The concierge guided us to the right attractions & tours for our requirements. A memorable stay & we would recommend this hotel to anyone heading to San Francisco.",9-Sep-14,5
"This Grand Hyatt hotel was clearly just refurbished! It looks brand new!!!!! We had a great sleep. We were pleasantly surprised that we were able to check in very early, which was great for a day of sight seeing! The concierge desk is very helpful. We had a great stay!",8-Sep-14,5
"The hotel was very accommodation to my family. They gave us a room close to our grandparents, provided complimentary baby care items, set up the room well, and coordinated will with babysitters. Very nice hotel.",8-Sep-14,5
"This is a top-notch modern-style hotel in the heart of San Francisco. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the location is ideal. We stayed in a ""city view"" room which was a nice bonus. Not much more you can ask for in a hotel.",7-Sep-14,5
This is a great hotel to stay at. It has been recently refurbished so the rooms are fresh and trendy. The staff are helpful and the location is very good; right on the corner of Union Square for easy access to the cable cars and shopping area. It was just a shame that there is no rooftop bar/restaurant.,6-Sep-14,5
"I was overwhelmed with the thoughtful service and wonderful amenities at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. Steve checked me in and made a point to find a great room with a nice view, even though I am not in a higher Hyatt rewards category (and I was also on government business & staying at government rate). On two different days, Ron kindly made change for me when I needed it. Other staff were also helpful, although I did not get everyone's name. I am very picky about where I stay and hate rude and disinterested staff but I can report that staff here are incredibly kind and helpful. It was obvious to me that this was a well-managed hotel. Rooms had all the amenities one could want and I appreciated the free WiFi. I was afraid that we would be charged for the fitness center so I did not bother to bring my workout attire, but I was told that the fitness center was complimentary and also had amazing views. My only suggestion would be the inclusion of a ""night light"" in the room as I don't like to sleep in a completely dark room so my only option was to leave the bathroom light on all night. There was still too much light as the bathroom door was opaque. All in all, though, I would definitely stay again. Well done Grand Hyatt SF.",6-Sep-14,5
"As soon as you walk into this hotel, it is clear that it is extremely chic and perfect for business travellers and families alike. We stopped in the 'Grand club room double' on the 32nd floor - with huge windows that overlooked parts of the city below us. The view of union square is brilliant, and it is in the perfect location for everybody, within a 10 minute cab ride to Fishermans Wharf, and only a few minutes walk to the Westfield mall. The room was modern and spacious, the beds were comfortable and everybody woke up well rested. The lobby is also very good to relax in, with comfortable sofas in front of fireplaces, televisions and a coffee shop! I strongly recommend upgrading to the Club room as well, as we found ourselves in it at least twice a day. There is a huge selection of delicious food and drink to choose from, and with the fast free wifi located all over the hotel it was hard to be drawn away! Again, it is also on the 32nd floor, with a superb view of Alcatraz, Angel Island, China Town and the city beneath. The only disappointment was we had to pay for the wine/alcohol in there. However overall we could not have asked for more polite and caring staff, in the club room especially. The staff were so warm and welcoming it added to the experience. Had a wonderful stay!",6-Sep-14,5
"The staff at both the front desk and the concierge desk were very helpful, there was a very nice lady at the concierge desk that helped get us dinner reservations the night that we arrived. It was very much appreciated since we had flown from the east coast and it was already 7 PM Pacific time. Also our room the first night was on the side of the hotel where all night construction was going on outside, they moved us to a quieter room for the balance of our stay.",5-Sep-14,5
"Grand Hyatt was one of the best hotels we stayed in San Francisco. Even though it was far from the city but it was great when after a long day you come back to a great , spacious, clean room with a great view. We also had breakfast included with our room which was fantastic. The satff very polite and accommodating. We had absolutely great time.",4-Sep-14,5
"Pros:The hotel was in a very good location: 1 block from Union Square, 3 blocks from Chinatown, and a couple of miles from Fisherman's Wharf. Wal-Greens, CVS, Starbacks are within 1 or 2 blocks of the hotel. The customer service provided by the concierge and front desk was excellent. Please check with the concierge for information about tours, cable/trolley cars, shows, etc. The rooms were average sized and had been recently renovated.The room comes with a mini refrigerator but you can request a larger size if necessary.Free wi-fiYou can request a microwave.Cons:Please note that there is a lot of noise from the street throughout the night. We were on the 9th floor and you could hear noise as if you were on the first floor with the window open.There are no towel bars in the bathroom, only 2 towel hooks.The bathroom door is frosted so your sleep is disturbed if someone uses the bathroom at night.The shower and tub are all in one.The toilet is very loud when you flush it.",4-Sep-14,4
"Our room had a spectacular view overlooking Union Square and our upper floor room also gave us a superb vantage point over the rest of the city, looking all the way out to the bay. The Hyatt brand is one you can always trust to be consistently excellent. The luxury amenities, electronic perks, and storied beds add a level of comfort guest can always count on. Service is excellent and the food options are delectable. We had a fantastic Sunday brunch, and the bar offered a lovely array of offerings for tea (which I skipped this time in favor of Starbucks across the street which remains open til the wee hours!). The concierge and the bell staff are immediately and thoroughly helpful, and the options for dining, sightseeing and more in the vicinity are legendary. Guests experience the difference immediately at check in where, instead of the standard counters which separate us from the staff, we are greeted at individual counter top tables with a laptop and a warm handshake. The intimacy gives guests an immediate sense of having arrived at a welcome destination. The lobby boasts gorgeous fireplaces and comfortable couches where we found respite from the cold breezes swirling outside and stunning art installations on opposing walls. My only complaint, not really a complaint but a wish, I suppose, would be for queen, rather than double, beds in the double room. We brought along our two teenaged sons, so the accommodations were a bit tight, but were we offered a larger room at a lesser hotel we'd never have opted for it. Hyatt is a no-fail brand in my book!",4-Sep-14,4
"Grand Hyatt was one of the highlights of our stay in San Fran. We stayed here for 3 nights, it was our anniversary. When we checked in the lady at the counter sent us a bottle of wine and strawberries which was really lovely. We had an amazing view from our room! The room was clean, spacious and well equipped. We used the gym one time and the view is to die for! We ordered room service coz the day we landed we were tired, and let me tell you, this was by far the best room service ever! We loved it!! everything is so convenient from the Hyatt. Would definitely stay here if weâ€™re in San Fran.",3-Sep-14,5
"My only complaint is that we didn't get the room I reserved and paid for. We were supposed to have a view of the bay, which I re-confirmed before going up to our room, but they said they were booked and didn't have it available. I have a sneaking suspicion it's because I reserved via hotels.com so they didn't want to honor my reservation, even though that's what I had paid for and we were celebrating my birthday,Everything else was very good. Smooth and quick check-in/out. Our room was very nice and clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel restaurant was excellent, which was a relief because we had done so much running around, researching and eating at area restaurants that we just wanted to stay in on this night. I highly recommend eating there. Our room-service breakfast the next morning was also very, very good and the service was awesome. If they have the tomato soup on the menu, you've got to order it. It was excellent.",3-Sep-14,4
"We stayed at this hotel 8/28-9/2 and were glad that we did. The property has undergone remodeling which has created a modern, classy hotel. The 25th floor room overlooking Union Square was great. We had two issues that were resolved immediately. Wonderful service. We ate dinner at the hotel one evening and it was extremely good. The door men in their top hats were very professional and always were on hand to secure us a cab. We needed to rent a car one day and the concierge desk took care of everything. The car was delivered to the front door of the hotel. We had a minor snafu with the gas, as it was delivered with less than half a tank yet the contract showed that it was full. The concierge waived all gas charges. Amazing, really. Finally, it was a one year anniversary for us and at check in they gave us complimentary choices of drinks and snacks. I will definitely come back to this hotel, and can't recommend it enough.",3-Sep-14,5
"My wife and I along with two other couples stayed at this hotel Thursday August 28 thru September 2. With the exception of the noise from construction work being done outside, this is a great hotel. The staff is very professional and goes the extra mile to ensure your needs are taken care of. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, plus it offers discounts on tour buses. Definitely a cut above most hotel I've stayed at.",3-Sep-14,4
"Amazing experience at the Grand Hyatt. Staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, bellman, concierge, front desk, and Club staff. If you are able, I would highly recommend upgrading your room to a Club Level room if available. This Hyatt has an amazing Club room with a panoramic view of the city and bay!! Not to mention the breakfast and evening appetizers. Also, a great gym on the 35th floor! Also with an amazing view and great equipment.",3-Sep-14,5
"We stayed at this hotel last Saturday 8/30/14We arrived around 11 am, obviously our room was not ready yet,But the good thing was, they gave us our room around 3:30 thinking our checking is at 4:00 pm and was the perfect room, magnificent view, I was able to see in front of my window Macy's, Louis Vuitton boutique, oh was pretty nice.The service was excellent, no complaint.Totally recommend like a first choice if you go to San Francisco to shopping at union square.",2-Sep-14,5
"You will not be disappointed staying in this hotel. Fantastic location. Clean, classy and friendly - what more could you want. Five star in experience in everyway. All staff from front desk to tour desk and housekeeping were very welcoming which can be unusual in hotels today.",2-Sep-14,5
The Grand Hyatt is my accommodation of choice when attending conferences in San Francisco. I go yearly and the rooms are nice and clean. I tend to eat in the hotel and the restaurant has great happy hour prices. A midnight cheesecake snack is nice too! They have great music in the bar and nice meeting rooms. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt.,2-Sep-14,4
"The Concierge is especially helpful and knowledgable. Though I lived in the City for 3 years, there's no better recommendation than those closest and making continuous evaluations. That's this hotel's Concierge.",2-Sep-14,5
"Of all the Hyatt's we have stayed at this rates as the best. From the time you drop your car to the time you depart (four night stay), every employee offers a smile and a ""can I help you""? Front desk, restaurant, housekeeping, and particularly the Concierge staff were very efficient and you felt like you were getting personal attention. If you have Club Room status you will be especially pleased with the food and service. Have stayed at the water front on previous trips but this Union Square location is the best for tourists.",2-Sep-14,5
"Really enjoyed this hotel and it's location. The layout of the lobby is a bit confusing for check-in, but that's a pretty minor thing considering there is no shortage of people available to ask questions. I had a room with a city view and access to the Grand Club Lounge and it was very nice... the service was great and food was wonderful with lots of options and a great breakfast selection! I ordered room service one night through the tv internet connection and it arrived incorrect so that was disappointing. The view out the window certainly could not be beat!The room contained no information on how to conserve resources for towels, etc. not being exchanged, and the typical ""hang if you want to keep it"" policy did not work as my towels were replaced after doing that.The hotel is in walking distance to the Union Square area where I was attending a conference and that made it extremely convenient!",2-Sep-14,4
"My wife and I spent one night here after our trip to Pebble Beach. We got a great rate for a Sunday night. Valet parking was highway robbery ; about $20 more than others in the area. Very nice modern lobby, and the room was very zen. Our bathroom sink was very awkwardly shaped ; looked like a miniature bath tub. The lighting in the bathroom was great. Breakfast was very good, and the service was top notch. Would definitely consider staying here again, but only if I come in by cab. I refuse to pay $62 for valet parking. I know this is San Fran, but it's ridiculous.",2-Sep-14,4
"we stayed at this Hyatt for 2 nights. We found that the service was very good, everyone is friendly from front desk to valet parking attendant. Location is second to none, close to all the shop and restaurant.our room was very spacious, very cleanOnly downside, there was a rattling sound ni our room, we could not locate its provenance. We also were a bit concerned about security, the lobby is crowded at all times and everyone can use the lift, no card access or anything.",31-Aug-14,4
"We looked at the previous reviews and two weeks prior to arriving asked for a room a little farther from the construction. The staff were very accommodating and immediately arranged this for us.We were assigned a room on the 31st floor with a view of the bay and it was spectacular. We enjoyed our room and had 11 beautiful days !When we first arrived we were greeted by Nikita, who checked us in a very professional manner. She was very enthusiastic and helpful. In fact, contrary to a couple of odd reviews we saw, everyone was professional and polite. The Grand Club Lounge was great. It was also had a professional staff and was very scenic. We had room service a couple of times during our stay (yes the restaurants do start to close down at 10:00). The price was comparable to a restaurant price (I guess that is because it comes from the one-up). The location was great and very central to our needs.We have stayed in other hotels in San Francisco in the past and quite frankly the Grand Hyatt is far superior. We will definitely be returning.",31-Aug-14,5
This Grand Hyatt is a bit dated but is in a great location right next to Union Square. Top Floor lounge offers breathtaking views of the city! Close to the cable cars & dozens of great restaurants nearby. Concierge was very professional and helpful.,30-Aug-14,4
"The incredible, hard-working team at the Grand Hyatt SF truly makes this one of the most fantastic hotels in the area! Everyone went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable, especially Elaine the Concierge, who helped us book our tours and navigate the city like pros! Great location. Great rooms. Great team!",30-Aug-14,5
"Stayed here with two nights with my family. Our rooms faced the Union Square, Macy's and Saks Fifth Avenue. The hotel is within walking distance to the Westfield Mall on Market Street. The staff at this hotel is very engaging and extremely helpful. We had around 16 luggages and the doorman and a bellman handled them without any fuss and with full efficiency. The Concierge assist us to book a large van to transfer us to SFO. We highly recommend this hotel.",29-Aug-14,5
"If you're a centralised location surrounded by lots of shopping, people, food & easy access to public transport, then this hotel is for you! Just be be warned of the ongoing road upgrade at Stockton St - goes 24 hours everyday except Sunday! We stayed for 5 nights, & if you're a light sleeper, the noise from the street travelling upwards may keep you up & wishing you stayed somewhere else! Front line & concierge staff were courteous. Unfortunately, housekeeping service levels fell a bit short for such highly rated hotel. I dialled for a few room items (bedroom slippers, cotton balls) & they were not delivered until I had to ask for them a day later! On another occasion when we requested to borrow the weighing scale, the person who delivered it to our room had a look that he wished he was doing something else instead! I read previously that hotel had recently been upgraded with improvements to the rooms. Whilst the room is sleek, there is no separate shower cubicle in the bathroom, You need to climb into bath & pulled the curtain & shower the ""old fashion"" way. No complimentary bottled mineral water. I wanted to give this hotel an above average rating but finds it hard to justify esp for such a well known hotel brand to be exhibiting much inferior customer service compared to their other peers within the HYATT group of hotels.",29-Aug-14,3
"We only stayed here two nights but this is a really luxurious place to stay. We had a bay view room and the views were spectacular. Alcatraz and Fishermans Wharf were right out the window ( really a mile or so but it felt closer). The windows are floor to ceiling and the power shades were very cool. The hotel has a nice restaurant and bar with live music almost ever night. We were two blocks from China Town, a mile from Fisherman's wharf. Everything was great.",28-Aug-14,5
"We stayed here for 5 days and would definitely stay here again, when we revisit San Francisco. This was our first time in San Francisco and the concierge, John, was fantastic!!!! He gave us maps of the city and how to get around, and we pretty much navigated with ease. We stayed on the 17th floor and everything was great. Nice nice hotel. Great staff. Oh, and the location is superb. It's in the heart of Union Square, close to anything you may need. Cabs, public transportation, shopping, sight seeing, anything.",28-Aug-14,5
"Great location, decent enough room, but don't stay here if you need hotel WiFi. Was staying here for business and absolutely needed internet access in the room. The free WiFi offered by the hotel didn't work so I upgraded to the $10/day access - still didn't work at all. Ended up making multiple trips to Starbucks across the street just to fire off some work emails. Unacceptable in this day and age.",27-Aug-14,3
"I really liked this hotel for many reasons, - The location is ideal, close to all the shops and restaurants and bars and right on union square, you cant get better- The staff are all very helpful and friendly, excellent service- The amenities offered are outstanding from the standard toiletries and sewing kits, to hair styling tools! you literally don't need to pack anything to stay there except your clothes!- The concierge desk gave us an incredible service, taking the time to find great restaurants , bars night-life spots based on our specific preferences and offering advice on everything from timings to local areas, safety etc..they also booked us on a great wine tasting tour.- The breakfasts and food in general was delicious! the coffee not so good though...!- the rooms are very nice and spacious and well decoratedthe only thing I don't understand from a hotel that offers so much is why they are being funny about their WIFI, they offer this free but its a terrible service you cannot connect for very long and the reception is on and off. However they also offer a chargeable one which they say is better. I believe a hotel of this calibre should be offering a strong and reliable FREE WIFI connection so refused to pay more for the better one. They need to fix this issue and make sure its offered as standard.",27-Aug-14,4
"We spent four nights at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco and were generally very happy with the hotel. The location is fantastic, the rooms are excellent and the staff are great!Located on Union Square, getting to all of the major shopping centres was an easy 5 minute walk and there were also lots of dining options in the area. You can hop on a cable car which stops on Union Square and get to Fisherman's Wharf in 20 minutes after a thrilling ride up and down Frisco's hills. Parking at the hotel was quite expensive (approx $60 overnight) but there were several cheaper options very close by. We booked a Grand Club room facing Union Square which was virtually identical to a standard room (we were in a standard room for one night until a Grand Club became available), but on one of the top six floors. That did make a small difference with regards to the street noise levels. Normally you wouldn't expect to get much street noise 30 floors up, but the construction on Stockton Street is incredibly loud and goes on all night long! The hotel walls are also unusually thin and the adjoining room doors aren't soundproofed so it was possible to hear (loudish) conversations next door and all of the noise from the corridor. This was the only downside to our stay. The room itself was excellent - spacious, modern, well appointed. You can do everything over the TV so there was none of the usual booklet/pamphlet/menu clutter that you get on the desk. There is a small ""powder area"" next to the bathroom with a lighted make-up mirror, which was very useful. The Grand Club rooms don't have a bathtub, only a shower in the bathroom and the space around the vanity was somewhat limited.The staff at the hotel were helpful and we received excellent service. We had an issue at check-in because the Grand Club rooms had already been allocated, but this was dealt with efficiently. The housekeeping staff were very good and our room was cleaned and made up to high standards each morning. We also found the staff at the Grand Club Lounge to be fantastic. Not only did they provide great service, they also interacted with the guests. The Lounge is definitely worth it, with a nice selection of hor d'oeuvres and drinks in the evenings and a very good breakfast in the morning with a hot buffet and pastries. The views from the Lounge were amazing and you could easily spend 2-3 hours there over drinks and nibbles.Apart from the noise, our experience at the Grand Hyatt SF was great and we would definitely recommend it... after they finish the construction work in Stockton Street!",27-Aug-14,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 6 nights in June 2013 as part of my honeymoon and was very impressed! The hotel itself was in a perfect location, close to Union Square, Powell Street shopping precinct and many food outlets.We stayed in an exclusive city view king bed room with breakfast included and the room was amazing!! Probably one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in (for a city location, as opposed to beach location). The decor was modern, spacious, the bed and pillows very, very comfortable and I liked that there was even a dressing room/vanity dresser incorporated into the wardrobe area. Amazing floor to ceiling windows provided a great view to wake up to every morning! Another feature the room had was the room service - via the TV! You could browse and view all the food items available and order as well - very cool. Wi-Fi also worked really, really well in the room!!Breakfast; while the food was great at the buffet, the area was quite small considering so many people are staying at the hotel at one time. We had to line up and wait quite a few mornings. One morning I wasn't really impressed, when we had been waiting for over half an hour and finally got to the front of the line, only to be bumped by waiter 'Douglas' for a family of four who turned up and 'claimed' they had been lining up earlier and had just gone downstairs to get some fresh air - well, we could all turn up and say that now couldn't we?? Nonetheless, the AMAZING pastries made up for my frustration! (I'm pretty sure they were cronuts). Special mention goes to a wonderful waitress named 'Wendy' - if only all waitstaff were like Wendy! She was friendly, on the ball and very prompt with her service.I would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt if I ever visited again, and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to SF!",26-Aug-14,4
Well. I really liked this hotel room . It has a really comfy bed and I had great views with the electric blind control right next to the bed so I didn't have to move . The plug socket was also just next to the bed ( which is a well thought out addition to any hotel ) so you don't have to fall out of bed to find your phone . I was delighted do to find a kettle in the room . As a tea drinker it's a luxury you don't find in many American hotels . They even put a little jug of milk in the fridge for you which is the attention to detail I crave when staying in a big hotel . The location is fabulous ( no hills to climb) the staff I encountered were polite but not welcoming or friendly . The view from the gym is great . The only thing it lacks is a pool. Over all I was very impressed with tis hotel,26-Aug-14,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on a family trip in June of 2014. Check in was expeditious, hotel is well appointed and rooms are newly remodeled, modern and clean. For the area, the rooms are a nice size and vistas are great. You can't beat the central location to Union Square, great restaurants and shops. Bell Service was fantastic, very personable Doorman who offers information when needed. The hotel caters to mostly business travelers but families were also welcome. Rooms are a little tight for 4 persons (family) but well appointed and very clean. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely return.",26-Aug-14,4
"My wife and I stayed here for a 10th anniversary trip, and boy, did the hotel make it special! We had booked a Club room and they upgraded us to a suite. They also provided some snacks and wine. The front desk was very welcoming, more than usual for such a big hotel. The remodel is fantastic - comfortable beds, high technology, nice design. The concierge was very helpful with tour ideas and dinner ideas. The Club was a nice treat - decent breakfast each morning and amazing views of SF. Overall, even though it's a huge hotel, it didn't feel that way to us - the service stood out. Tip - if there are no major events in the hotel, the meetings room on the top floor provide amazing views of downtown SFO. We just went up there and looked out the windows. Would be a very cool place to host a meeting.",26-Aug-14,5
"This grand hyatt is a wonderful hotel to base a SF vacation, located next to union square. The check in process was effortless on my part, and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. My room was large and comfortable, with a great view of downtown. Be aware that like new york, the buildings in the area echo and project sound, so take earplugs if you want to sleep peacefully. There are plenty of muni street car stops in the area, and the Powell st cable cars stop at union square. If you are planning to take the cable cars more than once, each time will cost 6 dollars. You can buy a muni passport for unlimited trips for $15. There are a ton of shops in the area, so if shopping is something you are interested in, this is a perfect location.",25-Aug-14,5
"I stayed in Grand Hyatt for six nights on 23rd floor. The room was clean, tidy and modern but one wall of the room was a big sliding glass/window and it was not solid! When pushed, the entire glass door moved out substantially. It allowed plenty of police, faire truck and ambulance noise right in the room. On windy days (almost every day) the steel balcony structure made cracking noises. When I reported this, staff treated me like a five year old and explained that it was normal for a building to move with wind, failing to understand that it was the noise that was the problem, not movement. Bar area is small and can get full very quickly & live music stops early which was a shame. Not a hotel that I would go back to unless I have to. Nothing special; average.",25-Aug-14,3
"The grand Hyatt is a modern, well equipped hotel with courteous and friendly staff who seem determined to make sure you have a trouble free stay.I was staying on business booked through my employer and on arrival there was a problem with the credit card they had used for my booking. However the staff ensued this caused me minimum disruption by checking me in anyway had liaising directly with my employer to fix the issue meaning I didn't have to. Superb service!When I got to my room on the 27th floor I was greeted by the stunning view offered by the floor to ceiling windows. From my room I could see across the bay to the city. It was wonderful to take breakfast sitting in the lounger admiring that view.The hotel is well situated for exploring the city, a great base for any trip. ",22-Aug-14,5
"The hotel is perfectly located in union square, in my opinion one of the best starting point to visit the town. We had an executive room at the 32nd floor which was big enough. The room is modern and quiet (just some noise from the street). Personally I found very pleasant the executive lounge and the view you can enjoy from there. Of course the rate are not low, but in line with the category and the city. We always had breakfast at the executive club, which for us offered enough. The parking with valet is quite expensive (63usd) as well as the self parking (41 Usd).Probably not the best solution but a good one.",22-Aug-14,4
"My husband, daughter and I just stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF and I would like to comment on the service we received for staying there with our child. We had requested a crib in our room when booking, and without even asking we showed up to a room fully set up for a baby! We had a diaper genie, dish soap, bottle brush, snacks, change pad, baby soap and a rubber duckie to help us with our stay. This was much appreciated as some of these items I hadn't even though to bring. I found out afterwards that this was part of their V.I.B (very important baby) program and I must say it was great! One small complaint is that the fridge was very small, so storing food for our daughter was a little tight. We enjoyed the view from our room (fabulous view of the bay - beautiful at sunset), and the breakfast bar in the morning was a quick and easy way to get started. Hotel was conveniently located and the wifi was very fast.",21-Aug-14,5
"We stayed for 5 nights on the club level. The room (3005) was spacious with a great view of Coit Tower and the bay. Overall, the staff were helpful, the room was clean, and the accommodations were modern and comfortable. We used the club room on the 32nd floor extensively as there was no mini bar (empty fridge) and no water provided in the room. The club room was well staffed with free non alcoholic beverages (honor bar) and snacks throughout the day. If you stay on this level you should definitely utilize.The real plus of this hotel is the location. Very convenient to Chinatown, downtown, and next door to Union Square.",21-Aug-14,4
This hotel was having building work going on during our stay. The room that we were put in at first was very small and had an awful view. Our first night we were kept awake by building/construction work going on just outside the hotel. I complained the next day and luckily we were upgraded to a room with a view of Union Square which was much bigger. The gym is amazing with great views of the city. The location is ideal. Right outside Union Square and Macys!,21-Aug-14,5
"Just finished a quick family trip to San Francisco. As usual, had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt. Immaculate rooms, attentive staff. Special recognition to David and Jimmy on the evening shift in the Grand Club, who continually go above and beyond to ensure an excellent experience for guests. We will be back again and can't wait!",20-Aug-14,5
"Lovely rooms excellent reception staff made welcome . Excellent location though at moment huge construction work nearby,though we were there at weekend and didn't effect us .We arrived at 8.am and staff did all they could to get us a room asap as we d had a overnight flight .",20-Aug-14,4
I was in and out very quickly - one night stay. Everything was perfect. Highly recommend this to anyone that wants a downtown location in the city.I did the regency club - very nice. Got to watch a football game with snacks in the afternoon and had breakfast available but I did not partake. ,19-Aug-14,5
"Great location, right next to Union Square, the rooms are big and clean, very quiet for its central location, but i feel it was a little bit pricey. Basically at walking distance of restaurants and shops, Try to get a room with a view to the square, it's amazing.",19-Aug-14,4
"This is our 2nd time staying at the Grand Hyatt San Fran since last summer. Our room #2923 has a city view but not directly facing Union Square so the noise level from all the construction below and the winds hitting the glass doors have reduced dramatically. Of course, one can still hear the sirens but don't forget we are right in the heart of Union Square and the location of this property cannot get any better. Within a block, you have Macy's and Saks Fifth Avenue, within 2 or 3 blocks, there is the Westfield Mall with Bloomingdales and Nordstroms. Walk 10 mins and you are at Chinatown and what is even more convenient is that it is only a 3 min walk away from a laundromat. There are so so many great restaurants all within walking distance of the hotel along with many Walgreens and little grocery type stores that also sell liquor.Our room is great with automated black out drapes and sheers; coffee maker; bar sized fridge; ample lighting;flatscreen TV; free wi fi in room which is very quick this year; and a room safe.The two double beds (not queen sized unfortunately) were very comfortable (a bit on the softer side) but made a lot of creaking noises as you get up from it though. We especially enjoyed the duvet and there is also an extra pillow and woolen blanket in the closet.The air conditioning in 2923 was fantastic as it worked like a charm and quiet. We always kept it on at 74 to 75 at the lowest level (one bar) for comfort in the evenings because we found anything lower than 74 was quite cold but in the afternoons with the sun beaming on the glass door, we would keep the AC at 71 (one bar) to cool down the room a bit. We love how quiet the AC is in our room.There was a lot of counter space and a small closet which you could leave one or two valises. The Grand Hyatt thinks about everything as there is an order sheet in the room for you to have any amenities delivered complimentary. Ex: corkscrew; hair brush; razor; toothbrush; woolite; and the list goes on. How great is that!As for the dining on site, we always enjoy the hotel's happy hour from 5 to 7pm at One Up lounge where excellent Mondavi wine, Canvas, especially bottled for Hyatt is only $4/glass. Our favorite is their merlot which is an excellent choice. Beers are also $4 during happy hour and only their flatbreads are $7 while all other appies are regular priced. Again, our favorite server at One Up Lounge is Linda, who even remembered us from our last year's visit! We are really impressed with her efficiency, friendliness, and welcoming smile. Thank you Linda!We also enjoyed the hotel's buffet breakfast a lot and that is because the quality is top notch. It isn't your store bought muffins and pastries like what one would get at some of the other hotels like Embassy Suites, Springhill Suites, and Residence Inns. We especially enjoyed the Hyatt's french pastries, the little brioches, which were flaky, buttery, and they tasted better than some of the ones I had in Paris, France!The buffet consists of 3 types of scrambled eggs--plain, cheese with ham, and egg whites with spinach and tomato; bacon, sausages, cheeses, oatmeal, cereals, bagels and breads, french pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit salad, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries, and our other favorite is their flapjacks/pancakes. We have never tasted better flapjacks than here at this hotel because they are ever so light and fluffy. It is like eating ""clouds""--absolutely delicious!Those little pancakes at Sears Fine Foods do not even compare or measure up to these at the hotel! The bottomless coffee is very good and fresh with OJ juices but it is not freshly squeezed. Our stay is amazing at the Grand Hyatt and no wonder the hotel is s",19-Aug-14,5
"This was a really comfortable hotel, the location was very central if you like the bustle of the city. The staff were very friendly. Housekeeping was fantastic. And the best of all - this hotel has a wonderful lounge/bar/restaurant - the bartenders were wonderful and made some really great drinks and the food was amazing too. We were on the 28th floor so the view was wonderful. Nice workout facility also. Jaime is the best bartender ever!!! Thank you Jaime!!",19-Aug-14,4
"We stayed on 30/F with club access. The decor of the room is quite new. On our first night we found the dust on the ventilation window of the bathroom was a inch thick as it was just above the hook where we hanged our bath tower, I really could not bear with it and asked housekeeping the next morning to clean it together with all the dusty spots (eg the phone) . The dust was finally cleared out. My cosmetic bag was black in colour, and we did not open the window at all but didn't know why my bag after placing on the room table for 2 days has become dusty. Where was the dust from?The Club closed too early (at 9 pm), you can never have a drink there after dinner. Breakfast closed at 9:30 am in the morning. Compared with an hotel in Asia, it closed too early (in case you are on vacation) and there was not much choices on food. Only scramble eggs, ham, toast, bagel, toast, salmon. Very simple food and they just took away the food right at 9:30 am sharp without heads up. As it is a club lounge, it would be good if they could take order of the freshly made eggs and have more items. For evening cocktails, they were providing the least canapÃ©s I have ever come across on a club floor. As a conclusion, the club facilities need some upgrade hence it is not worthwhile to spend the extra there . ",19-Aug-14,3
"There is a reason fellow Trip Advisors have not rated the Grand Hyatt in the top 20 of SF hotels. It is the victim of some odd omissions.First, the rooms are good. Granted, one could pull a back muscle reaching around to the toilet paper. Strange, as there is a blank wall where it could be better located. And the sink is an odd dish elevated above a base. This seems to work well, however. So, too, do the high standard bath and shower fixtures.The tv has a terrific screen and the controls are simple. There is a lot of closet space and enough of a work desk. Our room had a separate area with a makeup mirror. We also had a wonderful view of the bay.The one restaurant is good and pleasantly staffed, divided into a dining room and bar area.However, there is no shop for newspapers and snacks. No brochures for local attractions. No parking and no area to pull into and unload baggage. To be fair, there is a private parking garage very close by. The reception area is an odd area in its simplicity of design. It works well when no one is lined up to use it.I would not stay here again. There are better choices, but the rooms and staff are pleasant.",18-Aug-14,4
For business or pleasure - the Grand Hyatt is my favorite in SF. The staff is exceptionally friendly caring for all needs of their guest. They're really commited to quality and guest comfort. The location at the Union Square is ideal. We will be back. Thank you to the Hyatt team!,18-Aug-14,5
"Continuing our Roadtrip from LA to Portland we spent a night at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. Up in checkin we were given an upgrade to a one bedroom suite on the 30th floor which was amazing.Very clean, very modern.The concierge was amazing in recommending restaurants and transport options.Thankyou everyone who made our stay so special in SFO!",18-Aug-14,5
Stayed five days for business this August. Found the staff to be exceedingly gracious and helpful. The room ( Club level) had a fantastic view of the Bay and was very comfortable. Enormous walking shower beautifully tiled and great water pressure. Great food at the restaurant.,17-Aug-14,5
"Stayed at this Hyatt as part of a business trip. The hotel has an odd design and layout. Getting to the registration desk takes a bit. Staffing at the desk is a bit light. At 7 pm there were two folks at the desk and 12 people in line. Not a great way to start. Rooms are large with several having a patio which is great. I arrived at my room to find no toilet paper. On my way to dinner I mentioned something to the front desk with a response of ""are you sure?"". I should mention I have status with Hyatt. Outside of the Intercontinental and the Four Seasons in downtown SF I am not sure there are any quality hotels. Unfortunately part of being in downtown SF. Would look for another location in the future.",16-Aug-14,3
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a business trip recently and had a great time. I traveled with a friend and we were originally told that there were no double rooms available on the club level so we booked two king rooms separately. When we checked in they were going to put each of us in a double room because there were no kings available! They offered to cancel our second reservation with no penalty so we could split one double room, which we did. The staff was very helpful, including the front desk, bellhops and concierge in the lobby. The staff in the club lounge was very friendly and even remembered our names from day to day. The food in lounge was great, it cost a little more for the club level room but the cost is made up for by taking advantage of the breakfast in the morning and snacks in the evening. It was very handy to be able to run up for breakfast instead of having to find somewhere else to eat. They had bagels, (including smoked salmon!), scrambled eggs with toppings, oatmeal and toppings, cereal, pastries, fruit, a selection of juices and bottled drinks, regular coffee and a cappuccino/latte machine. Our room on the 31st floor had a terrific view over Union Square and to the bay. I was surprised how much noise we could hear so far up, it was not enough to prevent us from getting to sleep but I can imagine it would be problematic in a room on a lower floor. The room was not especially spacious but it appeared to be recently renovated and was nicely appointed. The beds were comfortable and soft. There was definitely a lack of drawer space, there are only 3 tiny drawers for clothes in closet. We ended up using the bedside table for clothes. The room included a small refrigerator and a safe, both of which we used everyday. The door to the bathroom was a slider and when fully closed there was still a gap in the door so if you are a private person and are sharing a room, be forewarned! The bathroom did not have any storage drawers but had two cubby areas in the bottom of the vanity. The vanity top was mostly taken up with a huge sink that left little area for personal items, if they had installed a normal-size sink there would have been plenty of room for items. The shampoo, soap and lotion that were provided were nice, but my roommate ended up having an allergic reaction to them. The hotel brought up hypoallergenic alternatives as well as a selection of other toiletries (razors & shave gel, extra toothpaste, comb, etc). The shower had a ""rainfall"" style shower head, which did not provide much water pressure, but it was adjustable to a more powerful stream. The shower arm was not very long, I had to stand practically next to the wall to be under the shower stream. Overall we had an enjoyable stay and we would stay there again.",16-Aug-14,5
"Check- in was smooth and fast. Room with 2 beds was clean but small. Perfect for 2 adults. Could be very tight for 3 adults or if you have a child. Safe wasn't working so we had to call guest services. They sent someone from ""engineering"" and he couldn't fix it. He told us to give him 10 minutes to locate another safe to replace ours. 30 minutes after, still no show. I complained to Steve in the front desk who promised ""to light a fire under them"" but nobody came after 15 minutes so we left. (What an inconvenience to have to lug passports and jewelry around town because hotel safe isn't working!)We came back to the hotel after 6 hours and found the safe still NOT working and a note from Marco apologizing - plus a peppermint candy tin. Valet guys were fantastic. Hal the concierge was very gracious, helpful, polite and informative. Thank you Hal. We paid $320 for the small room on the 21st floor with a busted safe and $62 for valet parking. Will we return? No. We'd rather stay in a boutique hotel in the same block (there are plenty)",16-Aug-14,3
"This hotel is very clean & in an excellent location next to Union Square. The front foyer looks very ordinary, but the overall rooms & service are great. The gym is excellent with the most amazing view we have ever seen from our running machines! The concierge is great & booked all our tours. Alcatraz is the best tourist destination! Pier 39 has great food & atmosphere. We enjoyed happy hour in the hotel bar every night - good beer & wine. The staff are very friendly. We also appreciated that there are 2 laundrettes located within 1 street walk of this hotel. Try Lori's diner for a great 1960's breakfast. The fridge is big enough to stock with fresh food & beer! We would stay here again.",15-Aug-14,5
"I stayed at the hotel in December last year. The hotel was rather packed as it was Christmas season. However, service was still good and check in was quick and efficient. On Christmas morning, we found a stocking with chocolates and candies on our door. It was a very sweet gesture. The location is really good. Room was huge, clean and comfortable.",15-Aug-14,4
"Do not expect Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton or Mandarin standards here. Also do not mistake the much better Hyatt International hotels with itÂ´s inferior American counterparts. This is a huge hotel primarily catering towards tourist and conventioneers. Rooms are pretty basic and and on the small side but clean, contemporary and recently refurbished with windows that can be opened. Hyatt beds are usually to soft for me, so if f you prefer hard beding you will be disappointed. Housekeeping did a good job to clean the room. Otherwise service is between OK and non-existing. Location is great for sightseeing and much better than Fishermanâ€™s Wharf IMO. Noise level was tolerable on the 27th floor but I needed earplugs to sleep trough. If you get a good deal on the room rate or a room on one of the higher floors facing towards the north or east you will be fine. But if you pay 400 $ per night for a 4th floor room facing the Sir Francis Drake Hotel you might feel ripped-off.",14-Aug-14,3
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt recently. Excellent location, centrally located. The One Up restaurant serves a great breakfast with excellent servers. Upon request for chicken sausage, which was not part of the breakfast buffet, the server and chef quickly heated up the sausage and brought it to our table. The room in general is nice with padded bedding with good housekeeping staff. But the bathroom can use some improvements: 1. not enough hooks - with only 2 hooks and no towel bars, you need to get creative where to put your change of clothes and hand towel, your bath towel etc. 2. the bathtub has no handle or treading to help steady yourself as you step in and out - an accident waiting to happen ! Electrical outlets are scarce. We only found 2 electrical outlets in the room. The electrical outlets for a floor lamp and a desk lamp were both (mysteriously) behind some paneling !?? In this era of devices, 2 outlets may not be enough to recharge your phone, your computer, your iPad, your camera, etc. Better bring your own power strip !",14-Aug-14,3
"Not excellent, not bad â€“ just what you expect from a Grand Hyatt Hotel. Big rooms and very corporate. We got a room with a nice view towards Alcatraz, which was nice. The hotel has a very good location. As a tourist, I will recommend staying around Union Square and not Fishermanâ€™s Wharf â€“ which is better for a stroll daytime",13-Aug-14,3
"Stayed here two nights in conjunction with a conference at the Moscone Center. There was a line at check-in, but it went quickly. Instead of the normal registration counter, there are several individual stations to register. My 20th floor room was nice with a view of the city and bay in the distance. It was quiet and clean with free wifi. I am glad I read on a previous review that the room had black-out shades and where to find the controls (on either side of the headboard), because otherwise I would not have known. There is no standard guidebook in your room to the hotel and area - instead everything is provided through the TV which has a mouse on the remote. I did not eat at the hotel, but did have a nice dinner a block away at the Cheesecake Factory located on an upper floor in Macys. While you are waiting for your table you can walk outside and view the area and Union Square. There was a Korean festival going on in the Square and it was quite colorful. If you are into shopping, all the major players are clustered around and close to Union Square. We also had breakfast right around the corner from the hotel at Lori's Diner - a 1950's style diner. What's not to love about a diner with a full-size Edsel in the middle of the restaurant. Cheap and good. The hotel is also a very short walk to Chinatown and the tons of shops and eateries there. I am glad our convention had shuttle service to the Moscone CC, because otherwise it would have been a little hike. All in all, a nice stay.",13-Aug-14,4
We stayed five nights recently and really enjoyed our time there. Not overly in love with the lobby. It is a little sterile and not very welcoming. But the rooms are good and the Club and its staff are great.,13-Aug-14,4
"Checked in a bit early, our room was not ready. Offered a City View room or could store our luggage until our Bay View room was ready. Wanted the view so went out for the afternoon, came back to the hotel, waited for our bags to be brought up. Nice room, quite basic, lovely view. Bathroom looked brand new - sink nearly as big as the bath! No fan in the bathroom so after showers the whole room and all windows steamed up. Went to bed and could hear the guests in the the rooms over the corridor talking and laughing. The windows in the rooms weren't sealed correctly and the road noise and the consturction noise in the morning was very loud and woke us up. I know its a city environment but up on the 23rd floor we didn't expect it to be so loud.Conceirge was very helpful.Overall was ok but would think twice about staying here again",12-Aug-14,3
"We had booked a room for 4 nights on club floor but when arrived at 10 pm we were told that all club rooms are full and they can give us a club room only next day but allowed us to use club lounge. Next day when we went to reception in the morning we were told that they would give our club room only after 3 pm with no gurantee of city view which we had requested and which was there in our present room. The most shocking thing they told us was that we had to empty out our present room by 12 noon,keep our luggage in their storage and then shift to our new room. This absurd process would have wasted our entire day so we decided to stay back in our present room only. This was least expected from a Grand Hyatt property. The safe locker in the room was almost on ground level. Every time I had to sit on floor to open/close it. The breakfast in club lounge was upto 10 AM. At 9.55 the staff would tell the the guests that in next 5 min they would remove everything and at sharp 10 they would actually do it. The result was that guests would fill up their plates 5/10 min before 10 beyond their needs and then waste the food. This was horrible experience. Now some good things. Location was excellent right next to everything in San Francisco.The room was clean,looking newly renovated. The concierge staff was very helpful. The Union Station area is better place to stay than Fisherman Warf.",11-Aug-14,3
Spent 4 days here during a business conference. Great location for all activities within and nearby the city center. Room was modern and very clean. Service was attentive where ever I ran into staff. Easy walk to many tourist attractions.,11-Aug-14,5
"So much nice things to say about the Hotel and staff . Our 2 nights stay was enjoyable . Everyone is friendly , great food and clean property . We will be back . Thank you Grand Hyatt and staff . We would like to send a special thank to Jessica - Front desk Manager and In room Dining crew.Great Job !Try the One Up restaurant new menu too .",10-Aug-14,4
"We spent two nights at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco at Union Station. Great location, beautiful accommodations and excellent staff. The concierge was outstanding and suggested terrific tours and restaurants.",8-Aug-14,5
"The Grand Hyatt is pretty well located for all the things you may want to do while in the big city. It is easily accessed from SFO via the BART, however take the elevator up to Powell street rather than the stairs when lugging a 53lb suitcase. The Grand Hyatt has gone through an make over recently and are adopting the ""Personal"" check in. No more long reception bar. Frankly, when we arrived they were swamped and unfortunately did not have enough ""Personal Check In Folks"" to assist us. However, they did get it going and we were checked in and up to our room. We requested the highest floor possible, but only ended up on the 23rd floor. Even so, our Bay View was awesome.We decided to bounce downstairs to the OneUp Lounge and partake of a beverage and a quick munchie.. drinks were fine, but the food was average at best. On the food front, we did get a pizza via room service which was actually pretty decent, albeit $36 bucks. When we ordered a pizza delivered from Uncle Vitos down the street, it was less expensive, but no where near as tasty as our room service pie. We stopped in the lobby a couple of times for breakfast sammys and Starbucks which were quite good as well.Our rooms were always fresh and clean when we returned to them after a long day of sight seeing and partying. We got some robes and a razor since I had forgotten mine delivered to our room at no charge. The lobby was a nice area to sit back and share a bottle of wine with our friends, with very interesting art pieces through out. What was interesting in our room was the sink in the bathroom. Very retro modern and was not as functional as a normal sink. We seemed to always sloosh water around the sink areaThe staff all were friendly enough and the door man who looked like a walking fridge was always very helpful and quick with a hello every time we left and came back. He was one big guy!",7-Aug-14,4
"Ok, it's not the most interesting looking hotel - fairly corporate as expected, but it's in a great location and our rooms had brilliant views. There was a mix up to begin with as I'd requested two connecting rooms or at least near to each other for our children aged 16 and 11. When we arrived after a long flight we were told the rooms were two floors apart! Eventually we were allocated rooms on the same floor, although not as close as we would like. Fortunately the rooms were good - clean, spacious and with great views. It's worth paying a bit extra for a good view - ours was a bay view, the other was a city view but both were excellent. The rest of our three night stay was excellent. We ate in the hotel on our last night and it was good and not overpriced. Location is great for shops and easy to get cab or cable car. We also did a lot of walking plus big bus tour to Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz - both excellent. Must book Alcatraz in advance in the summer. Also recommend Slanted Door and Boudins restaurants.",6-Aug-14,4
"Recently stayed here on a business trip and very pleasantly surprised by how modern the hotel rooms are, they look recently updated. Nice location near Union Square. Check in was smooth and staff was very pleasant and helpful. Room service food quickly delivered and was good quality. Bar area was nice but a bit tame and quiet so not great for nightlife; other down side is they seemed to seat overflow from the restaurant in the bar, including with young children, even later at night.",6-Aug-14,4
My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon. Had an amazing time and the rooms were absolutely gorgeous. Will absolutely stay here again if we return to San Fran. Room Tip request a room on a higher floor.,5-Aug-14,5
"Union Square is one of the better locations for visiting San Francisco, and the Grand Hyatt is situated right in the middle near shopping, transit and the famed cable cars. However, the room was not overly ""grand"" but rather a bit on the small side - which goes double for the bathroom. Would consider staying here again if I knew the room would be larger",5-Aug-14,3
"We had some credit at the Hyatt so we were able to use it for a July 2014 weekend. Fortunately for us, we were upgraded to the most beautiful suite. It was huge with a massive dining table, living room and kitchenette. There were two baths and separate king size bed. We definitely loved it since we were traveling with a young child. We also had access to the concierge floor where there was a good breakfast, cold drinks, heavy appetizers and the female staff was very friendly and kind to our daughter. I thought the workout room was kinda small but my husband used it. We also loved the free taffy and popcorn in the lobby. My two minor complaints was the bed was not as comfortable as I am use to, and housekeeping wasn't all that stellar. I don't like to criticize them because they have the worst job, but I expected a bit better since we were in the suite. I think they must have been rushing because they didn't finishing making the bed properly and didn't clean until very late in the afternoon.",5-Aug-14,5
"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. Prior to arriving, Iâ€™d made several telephone calls to be clear about the kind of room we wanted; we were promised a specific room. However, upon arriving, it turned out that there had been a glitch and the room was no longer available. Gasp! The individual checking us in was the assistant manager and he said heâ€™d offer us a room that should make up for the booking issue and as it was a celebratory stay.Weâ€™d originally booked for the 15th floor and were given a room on the 33rd floor, Club floors, Executive Suite. The suite had a fantastic view with floor to ceiling views of the Coit tower, bay, etc. from both the living room and the bedroom. We were more than thrilled and actually glad that there had been a booking mistake as this room was so much better than the one weâ€™d bookedOur room was close to 600 square feet with a large bedroom, living room, kitchen area and bathroom. The bathroom had two sinks, a large shower and seating area for make-up (huge). The kitchen was more of meeting convenience area with a two sided below counter refrigerator, coffee maker and small sink. We bring our own coffee, coffee maker anyway. There were three large flat-screen TVâ€™s: one in the living room, one in the bedroom and one in the bathroom mirror. As well, there was a lot of closet space as well as drawers for clothes/other items. As this wasnâ€™t the hypoallergenic (PURE) room, an air purifier was brought up that evening. Also, the large windows were actually sliding doors that would open an inch or two, just enough to get some fresh air; I really like it when you can get some fresh air in a hotel room. The king size bed was very comfortable.The next day, a bottle of wine and cupcakes were delivered for the birthday; very nice and unexpected. The assistant manager, Zach, also called to make sure we had everything we needed. All of the staff were friendly and accommodating. We liked the modern design of the suite. There are one button touch blinds for complete black-out which we never used as we wanted to see the view. Some of the lights we couldnâ€™t figure out right away, as well as the TV but were able to figure it out quite quickly. The room was very quiet; as expected could hear the occasional siren but it's the city so that's expected.We just loved our stay as well as the location of the hotel. Spoiled now, I canâ€™t imagine staying anywhere but the Executive Suite next time thereâ€™s a special occasion. Our stay was memorable and the view just incredible. Weâ€™d definitely stay here again and would request the same room, if available.",5-Aug-14,5
"Great location and hotel experience. Came back here after 6 months and enjoyed it again. Recommend for families as the staff was passionate and considerate for our little noisy ""monster"".One of the best restaurants ""One Up"" in SF is right there at Mezzanine with delicious cuisine and friendly service. And I loved the view to the city, even not too high up, very good street view.",4-Aug-14,4
"Choose the Grand Hyatt because of the great incomparable location, I was with my wife and we were coming from Mexico doing stopover in our way to Bangkok we stay 3 days twice.Room 3409 with access to club floor in an amazing choice, the room gives opportunity to appreciate great view over Union Square, we tried the restaurant for a light lunch and was very confortable and good service, the bar in the evening with live music were we tried a Californian Merlot "" Canvas "" which was a good choice. noticed in the afternoon there is sometimes wine tasting at the lobby, concierge service was great and recommended us a tour to the Art Museum by Golden Gate ParkBeautiful scenery and nice place to walk.",4-Aug-14,5
"I was there the past week end, the hotel is very conveniently located on union square, chinatown gate is 2 steps away, cable car stops on the square. the rooms are ok but smallish (double room bay view) if compared to other hyatt structures, the bathroom is definitely too small.the staff, specially those at concierge desk, is very helpful and goes beyond the tasks requested by duty",4-Aug-14,3
"This was one of my considerations - choice between somewhere near the touristy stretch of fisherman's wharf, or downtown in Union Square. I am glad we stayed downtown amidst the action in SF, and in particular at the Grand Hyatt. Check in was a breeze and we were given a wonderful room on a high floor with a priceless view over San Francisco. I looked out at Alcatraz in the distance and Telegraph Hill / Coit Tower on the right. Room was spacious and the bathroom was very elegant. Breakfast was a small but adequate selection of fresh fruits, pastry and hot items. Loved the coffee. All the breakfast staff were warm and cheerful.Downside - we had a very bad noise problem on the first night when we were awoken by a party returning late at night to the suite next door. The door connection between the rooms was very thin and I was actually jolted out of slumber with what I though was someone in the room. We had to call concierge to feedback. Thank goodness the other party was obliging. No proper coffee cups in the from, only paper cupsMy son had a very bad abrasion after he hit the rigid LED bedside lamp which was protruding out of the headboards",4-Aug-14,4
"I was very pleased with my recent stay at Grand Hyatt San Francisco. We took the BART from SFO into Union Square - $8.65 per adult. Once we exited ""Powell Station"", we saw the many tourists who were lining up for the cable cars and it felt like San F. The walk to our hotel was short. We reserved an excellent room, that highlighted the city's view and we were not disappointed by the room. The size of the room is standard. I heard the hotel went through renovations. The bathroom door in our room was hard to open/close. Housekeeping was standard. A highlight of this hotel was the access to the Club Lounge on the 32nd floor. Employee commendation: David, a Hyatt employee was engaged with his job. This lounge has good views of the city, and it was relaxing. The hotel is right in Union Square and below Nob Hill. When I return to San Francisco, I would stay at the Grand Hyatt again - I enjoyed my stay.",2-Aug-14,5
"My sister and I stayed here for 2 weekend nights while I was showing her around San Francisco. For sightseeing this is the perfect downtown location. It is next to Union Square and all major stores are nearby very convenient for shopping. Chinatown is within walking distance. Also you can catch the famed streetcar right outside the hote to Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel seemed well maintained. Rooms are not particularly big but with good view through the floor to ceiling window. Grand Club was open on weekends, so we pretty much ate there all the time without visiting the restaurant. So I can't comment on the restaurant. Food in the club was pretty good, but it was quite crowded late morning (it's quieter in the evening). One big drawback is that there is no swimming pool. Another drawback is that parking is very expensive and it's valet only.",31-Jul-14,4
"This hotel is in a great location if you want to be in the middle of things at Union Square. It is busy around the hotel. Driving a car to it can be a challenge especially for check in, but the best part of the hotel is the valet drivers. They do an amazing job of getting cars situated when you come in, getting cars from the parking, etc. They also do a great job of greeting you when you come in each day. That adds a great touch.The room is very modern and if you have stayed in many other San Francisco hotels, you know that this can be rare as many of them are in older historic buildings. The bed is comfortable and the room is a good size for San Francisco. We did have 2 problems with the room. First, our TV wasn't working. They were able to replace it in less than 10 minutes. Second, our A/C barely worked. We would try to set it to 65 degrees at night to sleep but it would reset to 70 degrees. We are both warm bodied and need a cold room to sleep. We called the front desk in the middle of the night, and they sent someone who ""fixed it"" but didn't really fix the problem. We continued to sleep warm and not the best sleep as a result. Additionally, housekeeping didn't clean our room one day.Don't expect much of any amenities in this hotel like snack shop, pool, etc. Our room didn't have a guide with nearby attractions or hotel services.For San Francisco, this is a good hotel but it would fall short in other cities.",31-Jul-14,4
"We stayed here for a total of 9 nights over the 2 weeks period, once for 4 nights on the 14th floor and 2nd time for 5 nights on the 9th floor. Nothing cute or cool about this hotel, typical corporate hotel. Main reason I stayed here is because I got a 50% discount and it cost me $169 per night. In my opinion, I overpaid. Other than location and amazing views from the 36th floor gym, this hotel offers less than most of the $99 hotels. First 4 nights were ok, bed was comfortable, views were amazing, our room faced Stockton but it was very noisy. It appears that hotel is trying to save money on little things that mean a lot to many travelers: cheap coffee in the room, awful toiletries, basic TV channels, no HBO, no coffee in the lobby. I was amazed by the amount of dust that accumulated in the room overnight. Everything was literally covered in dust, it was incredible. Cleaning ladies were super friendly and nice, others were smiling robots. Hotel sells Starbucks coffee for 50 cents more than in Starbucks across the street, but people don't seem to mind that. My last 5 nights were spent on 9th floor overlooking Sutter street, view was less enjoyable, but I was out most of the day so it didn't matter. Bed in this room was very uncomfortable, my back was numb every morning. Overall, not thrilled with this hotel, I can't believe people are paying big bucks to stay here, such a waste of money. Two blocks down on Bush street, Escape from New York pizza has Happy hour every day from 4-6 and you can get slice of pizza or beer for $2.50(cup of coffee in Hyatt's lobby).",30-Jul-14,3
My husband and I recently spent one night at this fabulous hotel. The location is perfect if you want easy access to Pier 33 (Alcatraz Tour) and Pier 39. The staff here is highly professional and courteous. Everyone provided a smile and efficient response when being asked a question or looking for assistance. The room was immaculate and the beds were very comfortable. We had an excellent breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Other reviewers complained about the noise level -- we did not experience that at all. Hotel was extremely quiet and we had an excellent night's sleep. Amazing view of the city from our room. We stayed in five hotels while traveling through CA and this was one of the top two.The only downside I can think of was the Parking Garage. Parking is expensive and it did take quite a while for us to get our car. Allow plenty of time to get your car if you have reservations somewhere -- allot a good 10-20 minutes for retrieval of your vehicle.,30-Jul-14,5
"Arrived at hotel on a Sunday morning and able to check into room immediately.Very nice! Bellhop was very helpful and got us setup quickly. Our stay included Grand Club which gave us food and drinks evenings and mornings. This is a huge plus for traveling with 8 yr old and a teen. The staff at the Grand Club went out of their way to welcome us and remember our names.We stayed in a double room on the 31st floor with a view great of north/northwest San Francisco. Blinds worked great to keep out the sun and even though there was construction going below us in the Union Square area it wasn't an issue for our family. We ate at OneUp, the hotels nicely appointed restaurant, the food was well cooked and the staff was friendly.The hotel is close to every kind of shopping imaginable and the main transportation hubs are within walking distance. (5-10 blocks) We used cabs, subway and street cars which can be interesting until you figure out where to go but we found help when necessary. While in town we visited a Giants game, Alcatraz, biked from Golden Gate Park to the bridge as well as shopping and the hotel gave us a central location to do these activities.I would stay at the hotel again if on business or I needed a centralized location for shopping etc. but I probably would stay farther away from the city if we visit again with the family. This isn't a negative reflection on the hotel but only because we don't need the nightlife scene, etc that SF's downtown provides. Room was small but nice and provided a nice clean bathroom and comfortable beds to rest at night. The staff at the Grand Hyatt are very kind and professional.",29-Jul-14,4
"I recently spent five nights in the Grand Hyatt while attending a trade show at Moscone Center. It was my first experience with this hotel after staying in other nearby hotels for all of my conventions in the past. My first impression on walking in was it was a very nice place. The lobby has an upscale, trendy look and feel to it and the front desk staff was very friendly and efficient in checking me in. I had a room on the 9th floor and also found my room to be modern and upscale/trendy looking. Everything was not only exceptionally clean but also looked relatively new. This is in comparison to a lot of other hotels in the Union Square area and elsewhere around SF that are often quite dated looking. I was pleasantly surprised that the rooms had refrigerators - a nice amenity when you are spending multiple days in a hotel. The bed was quite comfortable and as I have come to expect in the nicer hotels, you are provided with a selection of pillows with a variety of firmnesses. I also noticed that when I called guest services for anything, the phone was answered on the first or second ring and I was greeted by name.I would love to give this hotel a 5-star rating, but there are a couple of things preventing me from doing that. First of all, the on-premises bar/restaurant is outrageously expensive. I had breakfast there one morning, and any one of the menu entrees will easily set one person back $25 by the time you include coffee, tax, and tip. That in itself wouldn't be a negative for me. This is afterall an upscale business hotel and you generally expect the on-premises dining options to be on the expensive side. The bigger problem for me on this particular stay was that there was road construction going on immediately outside the hotel, and it was literally 24/7. Because of that I just didn't sleep well at all. I was unfortunately kept awake all night by the unpleasant sounds of jackhammers and trucks backing up. Now I know that's not the hotel's fault and not even within their realm of control - shame on you City of San Francisco or whoever made the brilliant decision to run a major construction project 24/7 just steps away from a major hotel. I would however have to caution anyone considering a stay here that you can't count on a good night's sleep until the project is finished, unless you're capable of sleeping in a war zone.Other than that, I will consider staying here again when I join the same trade show next year as long as the road construction is complete.",29-Jul-14,4
I would not stay at this hotel again. The room is nicely decorated but the mattress is worn out and sags and is very uncomfortable. There is extremely loud construction noise at night from work on the subway station on Stockton and the front desk seemed to be unaware of this potential issue and not particularly sympathetic. The hotel lacks basic amenities such as a gift shop where one could purchase a drink or basic sundries.,28-Jul-14,2
"This hotel was a gem. My family of four had a fantastic stay here. The location is ideal just off Union Square and close to all transport. The staff was very friendly and helpful and offered some good tips on getting around. It is close to China Town, Market Street and other great shopping as well as food.The only draw back would be the room size, but you are in San Francisco where real-estate is prime. We fit a bit tight but well with four large suitcases.All in all I will stay here again and recommend it to everyone.",28-Jul-14,5
"I just returned yesterday from a 2 night stay with my 17 year old niece that I booked in early April. I checked TripAdvisor several days before the trip and found out about the construction near by. We took BART from airport and being summer, Powell Street was extremely crowded but we were able to navigate our way to the hotel. We arrrived about noon and our room was ready but faced Union Square. I could hear the construction noise and we decided to take a ""quiet room"" away from the noise. We got a room facing the back of the hotel (towards Powell St.) on the 7th floor. Let me tell you, the room was fabulous. It was recently renovated and I thought my niece was never going to leave. The beds are so luxurious and I slept very well. This is unusual since I have a Temperpedic at home and usually cannot sleep on a ""traditional"" mattress any more. The down side is that I spent many hours walking around the city by myself since I could not get that kid out of bed!! I question my ""quiet room"" since there was plenty of heavy duty construction noise at 11:00 PM. I guess I wasn't specific enough about what I wanted so if noise is an issue for you please take note of other room suggestions on other posts. Luckily, I was so tired I fell asleep easily.My niece loved the exercise room and used it every night. The location is simply divine - you are surrounded by all the stores you could want. Chinatown entrance is less than 2 blocks away and I even got her to walk down to the wharf . I would have given 5 stars but due to no fault of the hotel I gave it a 4 for the noise. The construction literally is a full 3 blocks down Stockton starting at the corner on Post and continuing down to Market. According to the news this is subway construction and will not be completed until 2017. We actually went back down to BART using Stockton and it was so much easier than Powell. There is a narrow sidewalk adjoining the construction site that you can walk down and there is not much foot traffic,.As a side note, if you like hamburgers try Super Duper Burgers on Market Street. The long line is a testament to its quality (and my other niece works at In N Out so I shouldn't be complimenting the competition!)Thank you Hyatt for a wonderful property!!!",27-Jul-14,4
"We booked a basic room plus breakfast package some months before on the basis of location and from TA searching what looked a more modern and spacious room compared with other hotel pics.Check in was very efficient with a very nice and friendly guy who managed to give us a corner room( slightly bigger) on floor 16 with a view of the Transamerica Pyramid and other downtown towers and a partial bay glimpses. Note that even from the top 35th floor/gym windows the towers block out a full bay view.Overall we were very pleased with the room etc, it is modern and relatively new, its not inventively designed or contemporary though, however it was always welcoming to come back to after tiring days out.We got a very good deal on the internet and by only paying a bit more got the breakfast buffet option for 2 included. As a walkin customer it costs $25 per person, which actually is still good value compared to paying for each item off the alacarte menu and there aren't many more options here anyway.However the buffet is good for maybe a couple of days but it is fairly limited and repetitive over our 6nt stay. Also there is only limited seating and staff so do prepare for a little wait. They can open up a further room down the corridor which can be quieter but you are away from the buffet table!overall we did like our stay, good hotel and we liked the location so you cant get much better.However we found our stay in SF hard going, a big crowded city with poor public transport, lots of road works, and many of its attractions closed for redevelopment- hardly the best mix for romantic stays.Unfortunately on our return to the Uk we found an unexpected charge on our CC. It took several emails and phone calls before the first professional person in the Hyatt group took responsibility to address the issue and sort it out. Not good service and disappointing.",27-Jul-14,3
"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in the end of June. Placed just 2 blocks from Union Square it doesn't get any more central in SF without the tourists. Further it is very close to the highclass shopping of SF. The lobby is a bit small for a hotel of this class, but with a high class and fast, serviceminded and smiling checkin. Valet service was great to, and the doormen are relaxed and smiling. The rooms are not that big, and not completely up to the modern design that you often experience at Grand Hyatt hotels, but definetely a nice, high standard.The rooms and the hotel itself would usually only qualify for a 4 star rating in my book, but the service and location just sneaks the Grand Hyatt into the 5 star category.",27-Jul-14,5
Stayed here with my wife and 3 teenage boys in July on the 30th club floor! A little disappointed to miss out on a view of the bay but otherwise perfect. A great friendly greeting from the doormenwho were superb and great variety and service in the club lounge as well. (great breakfast options)The rooms were very well appointed although a tad small for my 3 boys and 10 cases. The bedswere sensational and bathrooms very good. We were first time vistors to San Francisco and absolutely loved the city (so much to see do and eat!!) This hotel and its great location near union square complimented our stay beautifully. The club lounge was also a perfect place to relax and take in the excellent views. The tariff while not inexpensive was excellent value for a property of this qualityWe would return to San Fran and this hotel in a heartbeat!! Well done Grand Hyatt,26-Jul-14,5
"Stayed here for 7 nights & had a good night's rest from the first night. Room was on the 3rd floor & very quiet & dark. Didn't get to eat in the restaurant but enjoyed the ""One Up"" bar for happy hour - 5:00-7:00 for $5 glasses of wine. Very pleasant staff on check-in & housekeeping does an amazing job. Within walking distance of Ferry Bldg. & we even walked back from Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of good shopping close by.",25-Jul-14,4
"Loved being next to Union Square. Greeted immediately curb side as we pulled up to the hotel and the bell staff quickly retrieved our bags. The checkin was very high tech and smooth. Bellman showed us around our room on the 14th floor and brought ice to the room. Free internet and it worked well. Comfortable and quiet room. Loved the button by the bed to lower the black out curtains. Really like the couches and gathering areas in the lobby. A very comfortable feel. Got a breakfast sandwich and latte at the coffee bar next morning which was a big mistake, should have gone across the street to Starbucks. Had to toss the latte, horrible. Only two complaints, the shower head was pathetic and the water pressure very poor. Really surprised as everything else was so chic and modern. Also the bed mattress and pillows were the worst of our ten day trip. This was our last night and did not get a good nights rest. I would stay again if the rate beat the Westin around the corner which is why we chose it. However, it is hard to beat a Westin bed. ",24-Jul-14,4
"Loved the area right around the corner of Union Square, very clean, nice staff, stayed here twice and it's the only place I will stay now. Only bad thing is a little noisy from outside streets. Rooms are small but that's everywhere in the city. ",23-Jul-14,4
"We stayed 1 night at the Grand Hyatt SF as part of a Bay Area vacation. Though we did not stay long and did not use all the hotel services, we felt it was above average for a Grand Hyatt.Pros:- The hotel is in a wonderful location, just off Union Square. - Rooms were newly renovated and relatively stylish for a business hotel. There were all the modern conveniences, including plenty of conveniently-placed electrical outlets.- Though a huge hotel, the front desk was never busy and we were helped immediately at both check-in and check-out.- Service was friendly, from the valet to the bellman to the front desk. Cons:- Perhaps not the hotel's fault, but Stockton St is extremely busy and it was difficult to unload and load our car at check-in and check-out. There were many cars and pedestrians all around.",23-Jul-14,5
"I really enjoyed my stay. Starting the moment I arrived, my check in was flawless and the staff was very helpfull. I prefer a high floor and was given a room with a great view. This was for the Semicon/ Intersolar 14 convention. I really enjoyed the Bar and the food was fine. In the evening I even went for a walk and it was really enjoyable. Now for my issue..There is not a coffee maker in the room , I could have gotten room service but I prefer to make my coffee early and be able to start work without interruptions. Other than that I am looking forward to staying here on my upcoming trips.",23-Jul-14,4
"Wonderful hotel in the middle of everything. The concierge staff was incredibly professional and helped with all sorts of questions, Hotel beds are extremely comfortable and shades are controlled from bedside. Will definitely highly recommend hotel.",23-Jul-14,5
"I've stayed in this hotel twice, so this tells you everything. It is in a good location next to union square. The room was nice and modern and comfortable. Lots of restaurants and bars next to. China town is close by, you can just walk. ",23-Jul-14,4
"This hotel is virtually on Union Square, which is convenient (and also noisy, especially in a room that faces the square, and especially at this time, with construction going on around the clock on Stockton Street). Nevertheless, theres are enough nice touches to elevate this hotel far above the average for the business traveler. My room, ending in 20, had an unusual and attractive layout, with the bathroom next to the window rather than to the right or left of the entrance. The room itself, on a ""quiet"" floor, was spacious and well appointed. The mysterious switches next to the bed and the door were eventually revealed to trigger the lowering and raising of the window screen. Nice touches extended to the large bowl of salt water taffy at reception, the helpful (and very busy) concierge service, and a casual coffee-and-breakfast wraps service on the lobby level. Convention facilities were what one would expect, with a couple of odd room layouts, but also with plenty of washrooms in convenient locations. Meeting rooms on the top floor were spectacular.",22-Jul-14,4
"I come to San Francisco frequently, and never have I stayed in a hotel quite so good as this. Without shadow of doubt, the best hotel in San Francisco. When the doors are opened for you, you are greeted with a grand, open-plan lobby, with faultless ornamentation. The rooms are beautiful, the decor and amenities are luxury, the bed is high standard and the staff are incredibly helpful, on point and courteous. And to top it all off, the hotel situated in a prime location on Union Square, with the most breathtaking views of San Fran and the bay. A very well presented hotel. I'm proud to call this my accommodation of choice for every trip to San Francisco. Don't make choices. Stay here.",22-Jul-14,5
"We visited the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights in July to celebrate our Silver wedding anniversary. After spending our first 5 nights in Vegas and the very lush Vdara our expectations for the Grand Hyatt were high and we were not disappointed. We arrived and was greeted at the reception by a very nice friendly gentleman who wished us a happy anniversary. On arriving at our room it was a nice touch when room service arrived with a complimentary bottle of chilled wine for us. Our room was lovely, very comfortable and spacious with a very modern feel to it. We loved the fact that the TV was fully interactive giving information on the local attractions, restaurants and bars. Housekeeping did a great job keeping our room clean and tidy with fresh towels every day and clean linen every other day. On our first night we ate at the Grand Hyatt and had a lovely meal. We were really impressed with our server who was knowledgeable about the food and wine giving us recommendations and also spending the time to chat with us, he told us he had worked there for 26 years which says a lot in itself. The hotel is very centrally located within an easy walking distance on Union Square with an huge selection of restaurants, bars and shops. China Town is a short walk away and well worth a visit. We loved this hotel and San Francisco and would not hesitate to recommend either. We hope to visit again one day and would definitely stay here again.",22-Jul-14,5
"Stayed on the 27th floor overlooking Union Square. There was some street construction outside during my stay but the noise wasn't too bad during the day, and wasn't problematic at night. Free wifi was much appreciated. The hotel is in a great location for seeing everything San Francisco has to offer.",22-Jul-14,5
"Been coming to SFO for many years now both for work and pleasure and I've stayed in many different hotels here.The Hyatt has to be my favourite downtown hotel to date.Perfect location in the heart of the shopping district with good transport links to other areas of the city. Not located on top a hill or on a steep slope makes it easy to get to!Rooms are very comfy, clean and modern with great views across the city. Staff are friendly and helpful.Would definitely recommend.",21-Jul-14,5
"Had four nights here along with other family members who were in San Fran for a wedding. From the minute we arrived to the time we left we couldn't really fault this establishment. The staff are very attentive, friendly and professional. The room we had on the 29th floor was very good, nice and clean, well laid out and comfortable. The hotel was very busy (full house one night) but we found our room was quiet and very peaceful. Others who were staying there in our group commented with similar thoughts. Nothing seemed too much trouble and a request for an extended check out was not a problem. The location is so handy to everything. The concierge desk was very helpful and knowledgable. We will definitely stay here again next time in San Fran. ",20-Jul-14,5
"The position in Union square is great and having stayed pre refurb I must state it is a great improvement.Noise from other Rooms was no problem but I did ask for a higher room and reception were very good in sorting room--just ask !,Beds very good and bathroom fine.",20-Jul-14,4
"Expensive and blandThe Good:Great bed, good sleepLarge room, but no character (despite a fake bookshelf with books)OK (free) wifiFast and friendly checkin/outThe not so Good:5 star hotel 2 star shower water pressureNo long mirror, this would drive my wife nutsExternal noises ~ somebody sorting bottles at 3am in the morning, followed by garbage trucks and I was on the 20F",18-Jul-14,3
In the heart of the city and a beautiful hotel. Top notch service all around. Rod at the front desk was great. Fay from room service personally called me back and addressed me by name and took care of wonderful request we had for another guest checking in on there wedding night. Also the young woman working the coffee lounge in the morning with the unique name was very helpful and pleasent throughout our stay. Thanks for making our trip so memorable and I can't wait to visit your wonderful property again. Well done Hyatt. ,18-Jul-14,5
"Im a DIAMOND GP member. I used to stay here but not anymore. Why? Because its noisy. Nearly all are connecting rooms and when hotel is full you can hear that person do EVERYTHING. Noise comes through door since there is huge gap. Also walls are thin. Gap under front door is thin. No turndown service. Housekeeping sloppy. They want to get through rooms as fast as possible, Room service is bad and pricey. Have to call for ameneties. Noise from union square. Noise fro wind. Clientele level is riff raff. Stay at Four Seasons instead.",16-Jul-14,1
"Just spent two nights at this gorgeous property and hated to leave. The room (a suite) was lovely and comfortable, great shower (with one of the things in the corner for shaving legs) and the bed was super comfy. For those with access, the Grand Club Lounge, was wonderful for drinks in the evening (it's nice to be trusted with an honor bar) and ""continental"" breakfast (but SO much more than typical continental). Another home run with Hyatt.",15-Jul-14,5
"We spent 2 nights here and the location was perfect as I like to walk a lot when I'm traveling. It was really easy to get around union square from here. We were minutes away from the cable car and other public transportation too if you want explore other neighborhoods like North Beach, etc.The rooms were clean and the staff was pretty nice, but that shouldn't matter too much right? You won't be spending much time in your room anyway!",14-Jul-14,4
"Hotel is recently renovated. Lobby, bar and common areas are all terrific. Room was nice and plenty large enough for 2. Seems like some rooms have great views, although ours on the 5th floor was non existent.Part we liked best was across the street from Union Square. Cable cars were around the corner, BART station 3 blocks away or so as was the F line street car (both walking distance)It really is a perfect spot to stay at to explore the city.",14-Jul-14,4
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel or its staff. This was a very special romantic weekend, and everything needed to be perfect. As it turned out, it was even better than that. The room was spacious and very beautiful and the service throughout the hotel was impeccable. Had we left the room, the location would have been convenient for everything. Do yourself a favor and stay here.",14-Jul-14,5
"I stayed there for 3 weeks in June &July. Hyatt's location is perfect for touristic vacation. It is in the middle of everything. You can easily reach to touristic places, shops and restaurants. When you are tired, you can go back to Hotel quickly to relax. Rooms are large with nice view, elevators are fast, breakfast is delicious, bed is comfy..But staff is best. Manager, frontdesk, bellmen, doormen, cleaning ladies, all staff of OneUp restaurant.. I hope I did not forget anyone. Everyone tries their best to make your stay special and enjoyable. 3 weeks stay is very long and for problems arise, they were always available for solution. Thanks a lot for everything.",13-Jul-14,5
"We spent two nights in San Francisco to kick off an eight day California vacation. I looked at a lot of hotels before choosing the Grand Hyatt. The best things about this property are its location just up the hill from Union Square, the modern, clean feel to the property and the professional staff, doormen, etc. The room itself (10th floor, cityview, 2 beds) was a little small, though nicely furnished. I found the beds to be too plush, not firm enough. The bathroom door was a sliding door that didn't have a lock - not ideal when there are kids in the room!For those who don't know San Francisco, if you take the BART from the airport (SFO) its about $9 and you get off at the Powell Street station and then walk uphill to Union Square, not an easy climb with luggage, cross Union Square and then go up another 50 yards to the hotel entrance. The walk was maybe 10 minutes, but Powell is pretty crowded most of the day. The cable car lines all run near the property, but the lines at Powell are ridiculous.Anyhow, I was expecting a little something more from the Grand Hyatt. It had some nice aspects, including a nice sitting area in the lobby and a good happy hour in a nice restaurant/bar area ($4 wine glasses, beer pints), but all in all I think I may have been a little happier in a boutique property.",13-Jul-14,4
"This hotel is everything you'd expect in terms of service and quality from a Hyatt property. The location right on Union Square puts you in the middle of shoppiing and many great restaurants along with short walks to most of the city's highlights. Rooms were large, clean and well appointed with great views of the city.",12-Jul-14,4
"Stayed here recently for 5 nights. It's in a perfect location in Union Square, near all the shops and restaurants you could want. Short walk to the famous cable cars and only a 40 minute walk down to Fisherman's Wharf. The drinks in the bar at 'One Up' we're expensive but what you'd expect for a hotel of this calibre. Only downside was the noise from outside as the windows were not sound proofed. Would definitely return.",11-Jul-14,5
"This is a terrific home base to see many of San Francisco's sights, overlooking Union Square. I stayed for a week in June with my two teenage daughters. The room was clean, modern and spacious. We enjoyed the club room for breakfast each day and snacks in the evening. Check-in and check-out were extremely efficient and I enjoyed the fact that check-out and room service could be handled online. Wouldn't hesitate to come back. The only con: a little noisy due to construction near Union Square (not the hotel's fault) and thin walls. I hope I never have to endure my neighbor's loud lovemaking session alongside my kids EVER again!!",11-Jul-14,4
"Stayed at this hotel in the beginning of june for a week. The hotel is located near Union Square with a lot of shops and restaurants. Nice. Stayed in a clubroom at 32nd floor facing Union Square. The room was spacious and clean. Nice bathroom with good amenities. Very comfy beds. BUT - outside - every day and night - loud construction noise. We found that the windows had no isolation. Had to change room with a lot of difficulties. Not impressed of the reception staff. Best service in the club thanks to David. The food was average, the wine was good.",9-Jul-14,4
"Have just got back from our honeymoon, having stayed the last 5 nights at the gran hyatt in San Francisco.The hotel is ideally located for visiting all of San Francisco. It's situate on union square and is about a half hour walk from fishermans wharf. The staff are very attentive and went out of their way to help when they could. A mention has to go out in particular to the older Chinese waiter in the restaurant at breakfast, who gave the best service and had us rolling around with laughter.The only downfall to staying at the hyatt, is the ongoing road works on Union square. We were on the 24th floor and it sounded like they were working In the room next door. Fortunately they weren't working on te 4th of July and most of the weekend but when they were working they carried on until the early hours of the morning.Would definitely stay here again, although may call first to check the works have finished.",9-Jul-14,4
Pros:- Great location in Union Square- Quiet room on 30th facing bay- Used the club room for breakfast each morning and great appies/dessert in evening- Hardwood floor rooms were great.Cons:- software logic for elevators seems to be stop at every floor and fill them up which makes for slow travel given there are 5 elevators - - tip: take the two staff elevators if in a hurry- the welcome/check in staff need a bit of training - - the check-in area is open so you can stand around/with the staff. First staff told me right a away to stand away from the screen since has personal information. Huh? Why are you telling me this and why do I care when paying $250 a night? Figure out your problem and solve it.- July 4th event on 36th viewing room was overbooked so did not bother attending even though was hyped.Overall a good Hyatt.,7-Jul-14,4
"We stayed here for 3 nights and chose it primarily due to the location. It is close to the BART system, the cable cars, downtown shopping, food, and served as a good base for us during our stay. The hotel is modern and the staff is friendly. They allow web check-ins which allowed us to check in and avoid the massive line they had with the front desk. Unfortunately, we weren't able to switch our rooms as a result and ended up in room 320 which gave us a good view of the adjacent building facing south.Can't complain for the price though especially during the summer!",7-Jul-14,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt by Stockton during the 4th of July weekend for 4 nights. Overall it was Fantastic all around. Check in - Maria was so fast and efficient and friendly! What a great way to start our trip!Room - we were on the 26th floor facing the union squate. Great decent sized clean and neat king size bedroom. The only thing was that we had a noisy neighbors with two rudy kids (thin walls could hear their conversation). It was great after they checked out though.Service - fantastic staff fantastic service with beautiful smile on a their faces. SO genuinely friendly. Stands out from all other hyatt we have stayed including Korea, Chile and Australia.Food - delicious!!!!!!! Need I say more?I am not easily pleased but I give this place my two thumbs up!I certainly will be back.",7-Jul-14,5
"The bellman are READY to assist! Very helpful, and informative.. The elevators ran pretty quick, our room was lovely, lol I guess I haven't stayed in a hotel for awhile because the first thing I said was ""wow"", so futuristic, but only because the blinds were automatic:))) lol really enjoyed this for the sunny afternoon naps, shut those suckers and lights out! Everything was very clean, felt new. I will definitely be staying there again and recommending it too. The lobbyist even made reservations for us while we were in the room, that's pretty awesome...Didn't have a chance to check out the pool area, I mean I'm sure it was nice but we were busy enjoying the city. Thank you Grand Hyatt .",7-Jul-14,5
"The hotel has a nice location but there is an on-going construction nearby. We had the hypo-allergenic room. But even with that feature, I did not see any difference. In fact, I sneezed more than usual and still had my morning allergies. When we lifted the blankets, we saw particles/dust fly up in the air. The bed was springy and uncomfortable. My body sunk into the bed, which makes the pillow too high. I did not sleep well in my stay.The room was also cramped/small. There were just 2 beds and a narrow table that served as a dresser and office table. The room wasnâ€™t even big enough to fit a couch. Service was ok, though. Whenever we asked for something it was delivered quickly in our room.If Iâ€™m visiting SF again, I will definitely look for another hotel to stay in.",7-Jul-14,2
"Fantastic place to relax and unwind. If you are going to spend the money then I recommend staying here. Great hotel with great staff. Rooms have been renovated and decors are different throughout. Located in the center of Union square allowing walking distance to shops and tram, buses. Highly recommended.",6-Jul-14,5
"the hotel has a great location, steps away from union square, the shopping and great restaurants.the attention at the hotel excellent everyone is willing to help youWe stayed in a room on the 19th floor overlooking union square, At night it was noisy because of the subway construction",6-Jul-14,4
"I stayed 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt on a recent business trip. The hotel is in a great location in the heart of San Francisco on Union Square. Check in was fast, friendly, and efficient. The rooms are really nice, clean, and updated with a very modern European dÃ©cor. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size. The TV can also be used to access the internet as well as the hotel info and room service can even be ordered via the TV. One item to note â€“ the control for the window shade is next to the bed and next to the door, not next to the window. It took me a while to find it! Housekeeping was great too. The only complaint I have, as I do with many hotels in cities like this, is the cost for room service. The food was fine but the price is really outrageous. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",6-Jul-14,4
"The Grand Hyatt was terrific! Very modern, great location, and friendly staff! The rooms could stand to be a little bigger, but overall excellent experience and would go back in a heartbeat! Also, the concierge service is excellent and will help you with everything you need! They ONLY reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the room size.",5-Jul-14,4
"Apparently this hotel has had a makeover on the recent past..It worked. The club level room was not cheap but still a value considering the level of service, the view and the location. Hardwood floors, great beds and showers, and floor to ceiling windows. The bellman and valets were 100% on point for whatever you needed. Never a long wait whether you wanted your car, a cab or your bags. The hotel bar was one of the best I have ever visited, 20 plus foot floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street with a great selection of all spirits and the professional level bartenders to run things. The fitness center is on the 34th floor and you run on a treadmill with a view of the city in front of you.",5-Jul-14,5
"Aside from the convenience of the location our stay ended up being average and not very comfortable. We could not wait to leave - we were exhausted after our stay.The reception staff were friendly and helpful - we were given a room with a nice view of Union Square but we soon found out that it was horrible. We went to sleep each night with construction loud noises outside, it continued throughout the night and we always awoke to loud drilling noises - we stayed for 5 nights and it was the same every single night, never ending. I can't believe the hotel didn't inform us of this construction and incredibly disruptive noise - As a general courtesy. We had to use ear plugs each night and that didn't even help. The windows must be incredibly thin as it felt like we were sleeping out on the street.The room was clean but didn't even have a kettle or tea - Not 5 star at all without basicsThe Concierge team was the most unfriendly Concierge team we had experienced in all of our hotel stays - Very lacklustre attitudes, almost seemed we were wasting their time with questions and felt we were rushed. Just didn't feel welcomed - a smile would go along way. The first time we thought they were having a bad day but it was the case everyday. Some training at The Venetian in Vegas would show them how its done. To us it seemed this hotel catered to business travellers not holiday makers.In general the staff in the hotel were not friendly compared to other hotels - except for the odd few like the bar attendant in bar who was super helpful and gave us some tips for restaurants and things to do.Great location, clean but didn't have the hospitality standards a five or even four star hotel needs to make guests feel welcome. Service needs work.Check if there is construction going on outside the hotel before staying there.",5-Jul-14,3
"This was our hotel of choice in San Francisco for many years until we decided to go a little ""up the scale"", but then returned on this trip. Our experience was the best yet, and we are back. The rooms have been nicely modernized, and the service is much improved. Our old friend the doorman was still there and as gracious as ever.",3-Jul-14,5
"Iâ€™ve stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco (GHSF) at least five times in the past year for both business and pleasure (in these cases I was traveling with my wife and two daughters, ages 10 and 8). Iâ€™ve also stayed here with my in-laws in an adjoining room. The GHSF is a large, conveniently located option that provides a reliable option for travelers. I have also held a meeting at the GHSF (three days, more than 120 attendees) and strongly recommend the GHSF for meetings as well.WHY YOU MIGHT LIKE THE GRAND HYATT SAN FRANCISCO1. Central location. Located at the corner of Stockton and Sutter, guests at the GHSF are well-situated for both business and tourist activities. You are a block from Union Square, a few blocks from Chinatown and within walking distance for many businesses. You can get to Fishermanâ€™s Wharf if you want (one easy option is the #30 Stockton bus). The BART and the MUNI trolleys are within a five to ten minute walk.2. Newly renovated. The guest rooms have been renovated within the last few years, and the lobby has been renovated in the last year. The lobby has a nice seating area with sofas and coffee tables and barstools facing Stockton where you can plug in your laptop and do work.3. Meeting space. The ballrooms and meetings rooms are located below ground level, accessed via escalators. The rooms are large and flexible in terms of format. My meetings required a ballroom, a large meeting room for 40, and six rooms for simultaneous smaller meetings. The GHSF can handle all of this. Because the meeting rooms are on different floors, breaks and snacks can be handled easily without bothering (or being interfered by) other guests. Like the rest of the hotel, these facilities are very up to date.4. Highly functional guest rooms. The guest rooms are efficiently laid out. There are remote controlled blackout screens which keep things dark in the morning hours. The bathroom is aesthetically pleasing. There are lots of plugs throughout. King rooms (the ones I have stayed in) have a comfy chair and ottoman. Nearly all rooms are connected to another room, making it easy to accommodate a larger party. If you are not connecting, the connecting door area is a great place to put a suitcase. The beds have adjustable reading lights. Each room has a mini fridge and a safe. Be careful because it is easy to forget stuff!!!5. Staff. The GHSF has a very professional staff. Many of the staff (especially the bell and curbside staff) have worked there for years. Lyle in particular is very good about helping guests out with their bags, looking out for kids and other stray family members.6. Elevators. For a hotel with so many floors and rooms, the elevators work great. There is an occasional wait, but I never have had to let an elevator pass because of overcrowding. I like the stack of SF Chronicles in the vestibule. The elevators do not cause any noticeable noise (they are located in the middle of an H-shaped floor layout and are some distance from even the nearest room).WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE GRAND HYATT SAN FRANCISCOA. Double rooms are very tight. Perhaps this is the reason why there are so many connecting rooms. Sleeping four to a double room is not easy and there is little room to spare.B. Beds are soft and squishy. The combination of double beds and squishy mattresses Is far from ideal. The GHSF could use better mattresses.C. External and internal noise. I stayed on high floors in every stay but still could hear the street, a cab hailing whistle from across the street, traffic, trucks and cable car bells. The interior noise comes from doors opening and closing as well as the toilets, which flush at high velocity. I recommend earplugs.D. Breakfast could be better. The sit down restaurant is very small for a hotel of this size. The buffet does not have extensive choices, but I do give them credit for its healthy options (e.g., egg white frittata). There is also a grab an go setup on the ground floor, which is pretty convenient.E. Front desk could be better. The lobby is small and there are many rooms. The front desk can get really backed up. Theyâ€™ve installed a red arrow to guide the check-in queue, but I donâ€™t expect this to work. There are kiosks available to check in, but I wouldnâ€™t expect anyone to use these. Itâ€™s rare these days to not have my status recognized (I am not looking for a royal treatment but itâ€™s nice to be thanked). On my last stay with my in-laws I was very surprised at how inflexible the staff member was when I said I did not want to have a connecting room. My room was not ready and I never received a call to notify me the room was ready.The above issues are not deal breakers. With a corporate rate, the GHSF can be pretty reasonable, and there are no surprises when it comes to the rooms.",3-Jul-14,4
"Added this hotel to a weekend in SF at the last minute and what a lucky choice it was! Very very clean and comfortable in every way. I'm not a luxury traveler, so I'm sure there are fancier digs, but I would definitely stay here again!",2-Jul-14,5
"This Grand Hyatt had a great location, i.e. about 2 min walking from Union Square.However our room was not that spacious as expected. Also the breakfast buffet comprised of much less variety than what was expected from a such a hotel. The concierge and reception service seemed to be really inefficient and in general the atmosphere in the hotel was more hectic than welcoming. This hotel was really impersonal and considering the price of the rooms and relevant service, the value for money was rather poor. I would most probably not go back to this hotel when next in San Francisco.",2-Jul-14,3
"The Grand Hyatt on Union Sq is right in the center of town and is a well finished hotel. However, you should avoid it right now because there are major civil works on-going around Union Sq...at night time. At 2:15 AM I was awakened by jack hammers! The double glazing is simple not up to the task.",1-Jul-14,2
Stayed here for a 30th anniversary trip and it was perfect. Rooms were awesome and totally high tech. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Buffet breakfast a good value for the quality of the food. Location was perfect to get to any place in the city. But the coolest part was the gym on the top floor overlooking the lights of the city - with high tech treadmills and equipment. A definite great place to stay in San Francisco!,1-Jul-14,5
"I stayed at this hotel for four nights on business. The staff was friendly, courteous and attentive. The black out shades were wonderful - and worked. The bathroom was clean and the rooms offered ample plug-ins for charging your equipment. It is an easy place to stay connected with the office, or tune all that out and enjoy the city. There is lots of storage options - you can really unpack and move-in the room! The location is nice - but at the time of my stay (June 2014) there was a great deal of construction in the immediate area. Not in the hotel and no reflection on the hotel at all, just worth noting in a review if you are looking at staying in Union Square are it will be loud and streets crowded. This location was far enough away from Moscone for me to be able to get some fresh air and experience a bit of the city - but very close to everything and anything the city has to offer. All in all I enjoyed my stay and the amenities of my room. I would say this is a pretty sexy hotel - an excellent place for couples wanting a getaway!",1-Jul-14,4
"Following a warm greeting by one of the front desk staff and following the efficient check in I got to my room on the 24th floor  The room was modern well equipped with a fantastic view with some nice touches like the jug of milk ,lemon wedge , books on the shelf , electronic window blind .Bed was comfortable I had an adjoining door ,there was some brief noise from the people next door , the bathroom was clean and stylish I liked the bar with the elegant staircase leading to it ,good service and nice reasonably priced food and drink The hotel is in a very good location being just off Union square ,everything you need is in walking distance From the doorman ,front desk staff,bar staff ,and house keeping everyone I came into contact with was friendly and helpful ,this is a really excellent and well run high class hotel I look forward to my next visit",30-Jun-14,5
"Very good location, near union square. A little bit noisy at night as you are in the town center, but if you are in a higher floors then this should be fine. Breakfast was average with croissants & Danishes being dry, but scrambled eggs tasting nice. Would definitely stay there again.",30-Jun-14,4
"The rooms in this property were spacious and had lots of preprogrammed buttons for lighting, shades and such.My room was on the 32nd floor. Each room has a sliding glass door that opens slightly to allow fresh air in. My door didn't seal properly so he sound of Union Square far below came in to my room rather loudly. Other than that than it was a wonderful stay.If you are there for meetings, the elevators don't go to the meeting room levels. Also, the elevators can get overwhelmed with people if there is a meeting at has just let out. But, I would definitely stay here again.I took the BART in from SFO and the hotel is an easy walk from the Powell stop.",30-Jun-14,4
"Here on a trip with my partner, thought this hotel would be nice. It is nice, no doubt, but it severely lacks soul and the staff also seem very indifferent about everything. Do not get me wrong. They are in no way rude. Just lacking some happiness.",30-Jun-14,2
"Flew down for a long weekend in SF. Grand Hyatt Union Sq was perfect! We upgraded to the club level and that was an awesome plus. Location to BART, great Union Sq shopping, and easy access to Waterfront and Pier 39 was all awesome. Hotel was very nice and inviting and rooms very spacious and luxurious. Never had to wait for a cab out front and hotel staff was excellent. We won't stay anywhere else on our next trip and highly recommend to all who visit SF. ",29-Jun-14,5
"Check in / out: coldly efficient. No smiles. At all. Mezzanine lounge: good business lunch menu, restaurant staff were friendly and efficient. Bar staff were hopeless. Mostly hanging about polishing glasses avoiding customer eye contact. On one evening we asked them for a 2nd round of drinks and they said wait. 45 mins later we gave up and left the table. Rooms: smallish ""upgraded"" room facing union sq with construction so a bit noisy. Barely any amenities - had to call for bathrobe, slippers, shower cap, you name it. And they never brought the slippers. Major cost cutting ?Conference staff on the top floor and the ballroom seemed stressed and verging on rude. On one occasion they mixed up lunch orders for two groups - the waiter actually took my half eaten plate out of my hand and said: you can't have that. FAb views from the top and the Club. Not sure id pay us$100 for access to the club but we were given 50% discount which was ok - and better value than the ridiculously priced room service menu for breakfast - even by 5* hotel standards. Gym was ok - pretty basic but just about acceptable. Good location, newly renovated, but just over priced and disappointing staff in my view compared to other Grand Hyatts. Westin Market St round the corner was a much better experience overall. ",28-Jun-14,2
"I accompanied my husband on a business trip and we stayed at the Grand Hyatt. The bed was very comfortable and the room was nicely appointed but nothing special. The hotel has limited food and beverage service and the concierge was only somewhat helpful. The best part of the hotel is the location - right next to union square and just about anything else you would like to do. Catching a cab is easy despite the road construction in front of the entrance. If you are looking for a place with a spa or extensive menu - this is not the place for you. Fortunately, all of those amenities are within walking distance. As an aside, I found the people in San Francisco to be very friendly and quite accommodating.",28-Jun-14,3
"Hotel is fantastic. The rooms are very modern, clean and well appointed. The smart TV is also fabulous. Beds very comfortable and we had a great view from our high floor room- a pre arrival request which the hotel kindly fulfilled. We had room service one night which was very good and well priced. The location is perfect we went shopping a couple of days which was really close by and also walked to Fisherman's Wharf which really wasn't that far. The only small complaint was the bar, we went one night for a few drinks and our waiter was not particularly friendly and very slow! Such a shame as everything else was so good. We found another bar in a different hotel (Parc 55) which was much better. Despite the issue with the bar I would not hesitate to stay here again and would highly recommend.",27-Jun-14,4
"Had a very nice stay at the Grand Hyatt! The staff was polite and helpful, with the check-in that went nice and quick! Very modern room with great views San Fran. The hotel is in a great location, with plenty of choices between bars, restaurants & shops within immediate walking distance. The concierge desk was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, and recommended for us to take a day trip to Sausalito, which was very enjoyable. All in all ... Great hotel... Fantastic location",27-Jun-14,4
"The Grand Hyatt welcomed us with open arms, even though we may not have booked like we belong, that's what made it special. This was our final stop over before we hitting the road. The staff at the door were more than welcoming, the reception desk is different to most of the hotels we stayed in this trip, funky and welcoming.The concierge assisted us with a number of special requests and mailing post cards around the world was not a problem.The OneUp Lounge is worth a visit - live music - a good wine selection. The only thing that put a damper on it was the service on the final evening of our stay. But we will not hold that against them. It happens.Our King room, like most rooms in the USA had more than ample room for all the luggage we had with us. Clean crisp and modern.",26-Jun-14,5
"We stayed in this hotel, as a friend of Mrs C works for the Hyatt chain and recommended this hotel. The building itself is very nice. We had a lovely clean room that overlooked the city, which was amazing at night. It is centrally located and close to just about everything you need. We did not take breakfast, so I am unable to comment about this. The only issue we had, was that the sliding door to the bathroom got stuck in the closed position and it took over an hour to get me out of the bathroom. The maintenance guy took forever to come and no apology was ever made. For me this was just as bad as getting stuck in a lift, it was not a pleasant experience, yet brushed over by the manager I complained to. Not impressed with the service.",26-Jun-14,3
"Stayed here for 4 nights. On arrival we were greeted extremely cordially, and everything explained. Indeed, throughout our stay, nothing was too much trouble. The beds are extremely comfortable, and the towels changed at least once a day. We didn't eat in the hotel, but we did take advantage of happy hour. The coffee stop by the Concierge gave us enough choice for the morning. The Concierge staff have been very helpful AND informative. The location is ideal for getting about. Would definitely recommend.",23-Jun-14,4
"I stayed here for three nights for a business conference traveling with my husband. A nicely appointed, comfortable and well laid out business hotel. Great location with easy access to Muni, Bart and cable cars. The bathroom door in our room was odd in that it duplicated a pull curtain and didnâ€™t provide much privacy. I.e. I wouldnâ€™t room with anyone other than a family member or very close friend. Breakfast was less than stellar and expensive.",23-Jun-14,4
"We were only in town for 2 1/2 days and this was our first visit. So glad we selected this property. The location was superb, near the financial district and very close to Chinatown and major retailers. So happy to see my favorite Italian ladies blouse store, Nara Camiche down the block. Also a short bus or cab ride to North Beach or their Little Italy. Hotel had super comfy beds, ultra modern TV/web system in room(but no coffee maker, to our surprise). They had a lot of elevators (maybe 12) so even though there was a huge conference taking place while we were there, you never had to wait for an elevator and when you got one it wasn't crowded.The concierge staff was the best I've ever experienced. They were our lifeline in a sense, fielding questions graciously and patiently even from the road if we were looking for a restaurant or didn't know what bus to take. The reception staff were also great. They made me want to return to SFO because they made the experience so effortless for a newbie!",22-Jun-14,4
"Solid choice for a conference hotel. Some of the best conference food. Rooms have been redone and modernized. Staff are outstanding. Public areas are open. Elevator service and be slow and congested. All room amenities you expect. TV channels are slim, and not a lot of choices unless you pay. Location in Union Square is good for food, walking and lots of taxis and town-car services. Some street noise (night and early am) from the ongoing work on Stockton Street at Union Square. Room chair was comfortable. Lots of electric sockets at the desk area and bed. Free wifi. Good bar service.",22-Jun-14,4
"What a brilliant hotel! Rooms are lovely and ours had a fantastic view of union square through floor to ceiling windows! Service was really good, staff fantastic and really helpful. There was a good choice of TV channels and large safety deposit box. The hotel is decorated to a very high quality and is in a fantastic location. We could not say anything negative about the Grand Hyatt and would definitely stay there again.",21-Jun-14,5
"Loved the location right on Union Square could walk everywhere whether picking up a day tour or your evening meal or just a quick cup of coffee. The hotel decor was on trend and the staff were friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable, and the room was quite spacious. The view we had was not good, backed onto some apartment block. I had booked a room overlooking Union Square which they could not give me. This was very disappointing if they cannot provide the requested room they should at least advise you at the time of booking,",21-Jun-14,4
"We loved the location of this hotel, we were there the week before Christmas and looking over the ice skating and the tree was really wonderful.I would stay here again. Breakfast was a bit of a let down, there was always a huge line (the place was packed) but the actual food was the same every single day. After our 8 nights we were all a bit over it.The beds, rooms and actual hotel was great. The staff were really friendly and helpful, housekeeping was good.",20-Jun-14,4
"When we arrived we were upgraded to a room that gave us access to the top floor lounge. In here we had beautiful breakfasts, drinks and night time snacks. Our room was large, clean and modern. Only bad thin was the bath was very shallow and short but considering the stunning view over the city we didn't care. The staff where just wonderful and helpful and always smiling. Just perfectly located next to union square, actually jsut perfect",19-Jun-14,5
"Good position, in Union Square. Room and bathrom with new furniture, Starbucs right next to the hotel. Free and fast Wifi Connection. Nice view, and a fantastic gym where you can see the whole San Francisco skyline.",19-Jun-14,5
"Fabulous location, bang in the centre of Union Square but this hotel should be like an Ibis or Best Western. They were extremely unhelpful while checking in, made us feel like they were doing a favour while giving us connecting rooms, gave us a low floor ( which also they said were the last connecting rooms left) even though we booked through our Centurion card. A few room lights weren't working when we came in and after telling the housekeeping about 5 times, did they finally sort it out.The first night an obviously drunk and stoned person knocked on my childrens room door repetitively, after we opened the door, he tried to enter and we pushed him out. We called the management and they didnt even bother responding. The next day we left our hotel at 9 am and on returning at 6 pm, we saw the rooms were still dirty and had not been cleaned. We are frequent travelers and I have NEVER ever experienced a Grand Hyatt like this one.There are about 10-15 hotels around the same place. Im sure they offer better service.",18-Jun-14,2
"This is a large centrally located hotel in Union Square. The thing that sets it apart is the Club Level. Friendliest service I have experienced. Breakfast and appetizers were both good. Best is from 5pm on they have beer, wine, and cocktails with an honor bar (pour your own) service. A really good value if you like a cocktail or two or three! I would definitely stay here again. If you are a walker you can pretty much cover the city from here and work off the great food in SF.",18-Jun-14,4
"Oh My Gosh, where do I start -- Beautiful hotel at Union Square -- Everyone working at this hotel were so kind and helpful -- We were on 30th floor room with double beds with a fantastic view of Union Square - Just a short walk to catch public transportation -- great eating places nearby -- I can't comment on hotel food or drink as we did not eat or have a drink there -- Check-In and Check-Out very pleasant - I cannot think of one thing to fault with this hotel -- lobby beautiful -- rooms very nice --",18-Jun-14,5
"Myself and my Husband stayed here for four days middle of May 2014 and really enjoyed our stayThe location is fabulous just minutes from Union square, and China Town on the other side.5/8 mins walk from tram terminal.The rooms are spacious ,clean and quite.The staff are amazing, so helpful, friendly and our every need was met.Great small bar with really good bar food and reasonably prices and music most nights.Happy hour from 5 pm to 7pm on some drinks.",17-Jun-14,5
"Excellent location and staff, car park on corner opposite was good value for an overnight stay. Shame about the noise from the road works outside.Room was good although servicing was erratic.Enjoyed the food in the restaurant and the service was excellent as far as it went. It would have been better had we had the offer of a bread roll whilst we waited for our mains, also a server could have asked if we needed anything such as mustard (had my own) and how was our food!",16-Jun-14,4
"Very polite and helpful staff ....Check-in was hassle free and quick! Got put on the 21st floor with great views of San Fran. The hotel room was done to a very high standard (the hotel has just recently been refurbished - bonus!). In my opinion i would say this is the best location to stay while in San Fran. With plenty of choices between bars, restaurants & shops within immediate walking distance from the hotel. The cable cars (which take you to FisherMans Wharf) are about a block away - stunning views on the cable cars leading towards FisherMans Wharf.The hotel offers guests a shuttle to the airport for $16.00. Highly recommend this option as taxis range between $45 - $55 (also baring in mind the shuttle will get you there around the same time as the Grand Hyatt is one of the later stops on the shuttle)All in all ... Great hotel... Fantastic location.",15-Jun-14,5
"Visited with the husband and twin 15 yr olds. We loved the spot and great open view from the room. Room was a tad small for all of us but as others have said, there's too much to do and see in SF and surroundings to be in room that long. Easy to walk to cable cars. Check in and out was a bit strange with the individual kiosks but staff was very attentive.",14-Jun-14,4
"Stayed for 4 nights in two adjoining rooms (King attached to 2 doubles) on the 30th floor. There was a special family-stay rate for the adjoining rooms but only if you call reservations directly!! The rooms were very nicely updated and clean but very short on storage space. Might not be an issue for business travelers but one tiny cabinet with 3 drawers (crammed into the closet) wasn't enough for us, who were traveling with 10 days worth of gear. The small fridge was convenient though. Bed was OK; I thought it too mushy but kids and hubby liked them. The bathroom had huge sink and decent counter space but the rolling door was not very quiet and the track created gaps that might bother those very particular about privacy. We had Club rooms with a nice city/partial bay view. For some reason, the check-in staff failed to mention the really nice Club lounge on the 32nd floor. We found out by asking another guest! The Club lounge was well stocked with bottled drinks and had a full breakfast in addition to cocktail hour. Lounge manager David was very friendly. The Concierge was helpful with maps, dining ideas, and discount tour tickets. Lobby lounge had comfy couches near fireplace that was welcome after windy day of touring. Overall this was a well-located, nicely decorated hotel for our San Fran stay.",13-Jun-14,4
"Unfortunately there was all night work going on outside which we were compensated on when complained so higher rooms are probably better but the rooms were fantastic, clean and very comfy plus the staff were all really great.Would come back as location is incredible!",13-Jun-14,4
"Stayed from Sunday-Friday for CiscoLive conference. Check-in took a little longer than I hoped, not because of line-ups, but because of the casual and pleasant demeanor of the staff, who were happy to chat. I had just gotten off a 5+hr flight, so I wouldn't have minded that going a tad faster. 17th floor room was very spacious and clean, no defects with carpet or walls that I saw. Wifi worked well throughout the hotel. All staff that I encountered were smiley and helpful, including the staff at the on-site restaurant, where I ate dinner 3 times. Not a vast menu, but food is tasty and service is fast.Conveniently located next to Union Square Park, and close to other amenities like Walgreens (for those late-night snack needs) and several restaurants (2 great breakfast places 1 block over on Powell?).Would definitely stay again.",11-Jun-14,4
The Grand Hyatt is located in a great location in Union Square in San Francisco. It was easy to get to all of the cities main attractions and had a great view of the city. The staff was amazing and prompt with any extra needs that I had. The rooms were modern and nicely furnished. The beds were comfortable but not the best hotel sleep I have ever had. I enjoyed an evening meal at the restaurant in the hotel as well and the food was very good. I would definitely stay here again if I were in the area.,11-Jun-14,4
"We really enjoyed staying in this hotel, the location was perfect I went to sleep at night watching the shoppers on Macy's 9 floors. The staff were especially helpful with everything and the rooms were very modern with great views. Minor annoyance was they were a bit on the small side we had a bit of trouble finding space to put empty suitcases, however, perhaps they expect a family of 4 to rent 2 rooms??? We stayed for 5 nights and had the best time ever in San Francisco. Would absolutely stay at this hotel again.",9-Jun-14,5
"My wife and I stayed for several nights at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco as a part of a corporate event for my wife's company. For the most part, I was extremely impressed by the hotel, its amenities, and the service we received throughout our stay, but a few relatively minor annoyances keep me from being able to give the hotel a 5-star review. Let me start with the good: I really loved our room. It was fairly small, but the layout was functional, and the modern decor made it feel bigger than it really was. I also loved the floor-to-ceiling windows that gave us a beautiful view overlooking downtown San Francisco! The bed was also very comfortable and offered a good selection of pillows from which to choose. In addition to the room, I was also very impressed by the service I received from the Concierge desk. Having never been to San Francisco before, the Concierge helped provide some great recommendations for places to go and routes to take to get there, and this service really helped make my trip the amazing experience that it was. Finally, I was very impressed by the event staff and amenities that the hotel offered. The ballrooms were very nice, the food was fantastic, the service very good, and all-combined it created a great atmosphere for a company celebration.Unfortunately, there were several aspects of our stay that left a little bit to be desired. My first gripe is the shower in the hotel room. I absolutely love rain showers, but the shower head needs to be further away from the wall in order to be effective. Every time I showered, I felt like I had to stand against the shower wall in order to be immersed by the water. Not the worst thing in the world, but inconvenient nonetheless. And while I'm on the topic of the bathroom, I would also recommend that they invest in higher-quality towels. I've had better towels in far worse hotels. Another let-down occurred one night when my wife contacted the front desk requesting a pair of scissors to be brought to our room. However, no one ever came, even after several follow-up calls. I would expect better service from a hotel of this quality. And finally, I personally just didn't care for the Union Square area of San Francisco. The next time I return, I will most likely choose to stay in a different area of town.",8-Jun-14,4
"Positive: 1) The hotel was just recently remodeled, so the rooms and surrounds look quite nice. New and/or well-maininted furniture and fixtures. 2) The views from the Regency Club are panoramic and the staff there excellent. 3) Excellent and professional front desk team. They got the stay off to an energetic and positive start.Neutral: The place can get busy, so just be aware that there will be a lot of activity in the lobby and club.Negative: None.Elite benefits: Diamond members are welcomed quite nicely and treated very well. All benefits delivered like clockwork.Comparison with other Hyatts: There is often discussion about whether to stay here or at the Embarcadero Hyatt. This Grand Hyatt has newer and nicer rooms. The Hyatt Regency Embarcadero has a much nicer Regency Club with better views. The Regency also has rooms with balconies. If the room itself is most important to you, stay the Grand Hyatt. If little extras make your trip nicer, stay at the Regency. In the end, both are great hotels.",8-Jun-14,5
"I should have written this a while ago. This hotel has the best location in town. I traveled solo and nothing made me feel intimated nor unsafe while staying in this wonderful hotel. Personal safety is my prime concern while traveling alone.Situated right in the heart of Union Square, you can practically walk out of the hotel and begin shop shop shop until you drop. I stayed on the Grand Club level for 4 nights with free access to Grand Club lounge, which was a wonderful experience. I was also given a very well appointed room with sweeping view of the Union Square overlooking Macys. Staffs were generally helpful and welcoming when I dropped by and asked for direction. I must say, this is a perfect stay for anyone who travels alone and wants to be close to all actions.I managed to manoeuvre comfortably downtown, but found the street a bit rough at night. Just avoid wandering around at night on your own. I had stayed at the Ritz before. But if you ask me Ritz or Hyatt? I would go for Hyatt in terms of seamless service, value and location. I will definitely come back as this hotel serves my purpose perfectly!",6-Jun-14,4
"Terrific place to stay in San Francisco. It's about 5 blocks from the BART stop and an otherwise great location downtown. The staff are incredible. From start to finish they did everything in their power to make our stay perfect. We arrived at 3:30 and a room wasn't ready for us (check in is at 3:00). Nikita at the front desk comped drinks in the bar for us while we waited. There was also an issue with what package we booked but that was swiftly resolved. The rooms are pretty spacious for San Francisco and the beds are comfortable. There is a reception each Saturday with wine and some sort of ""taste"" from their restaurant. During our visit, it was meatballs and they were delicious. The OneUp Bar is pretty cool- Boa is the best bartender. There is HH everyday at 4:00 (I think it goes until 6:00) and it's a nice place to have a beverage after walking around all day. The gym is OK. The lay out is a little odd because there is a stretching area immediately upon exiting the elevators so that can be awkward. But there are several treadmills and weight machines and complimentary headphones if you've forgotten yours. My minor complaint is that we did not care for the breakfast here at all. Hubs had the buffet and I had the maple bacon benedict and they were both just meh. We opted to eat elsewhere the other days. I love the Hyatt though and this trip truly made me realize how great it can be to be loyal to a specific hotel chain. Thanks to all of the staff that made our trip so great!",5-Jun-14,5
"The location of this hotel is ideal. It's right beside union square,which is the main shopping area in San Francisco. The staff is very friendly and helpful and they have a very cool reception area. The rooms are nicely appointed and the beds are comfortable. We had a room with a great view of union square. My only issue was the bathroom in the bedroom we were given. We got a handicap accessible room so there was no floor divider for the shower. This meant that the water would seep out of the shower and on to the rest of the bathroom floors. The staff were nice enough though to provide extra floor towels to keep the water contained. Otherwise we had no complaints.",5-Jun-14,4
"We chose The Grand Hyatt to be close to Union Square. It was a wonderful location, just down from Macy's and so close to Union Square and Powell Street. It was so easy to walk to great shopping experiences and restaurants. We preferred to stay closer to Union Square than Fisherman's Wharf as it was less touristy. Our room was extremely modern, clean and well appointed. As other reviewers have commented upon, the rooms are not sound proof. We could easily hear the families in the next rooms. It did not distract from our overall hotel experience though. Very approachable, knowledgeable and friendly concierge and valet staff. Great to have a hotel car to choose from to take us to the airport. Would definitely stay at The Grand Hyatt if we are ever fortunate enough to visit San Francisco again.",2-Jun-14,4
"The hotel has been redone since I last stayed there, and cosmetically, it is great. The restaurant had some good choices for breakfast ($25-45) and courteous staff and waiters. The room was clean, had a decent space to work, fairly standard bed, TV, and armchair. The shower had a nice big shower-head, implying a satisfying shower but at full pressure, the water barely fell one foot away from the front wall. Rinsing shampoo out of my hair was an exercise in banged knees and elbows. The views from the conference rooms on the 36th floor were fantastic.",1-Jun-14,3
Great location almost on top of Union Square. Self-park just across the street for $42/night with full in/out access is a BIG plus in any city but especially SF. There are SO many terrific places to eat AND DRINK within a very short walk that the fact you do not need a cab to/from dining or to shop or to grab a cable car easily justifies the price.Very easy check in...one of the 5 most comfortable mattresses....our room did NOT have a view worthy of the word 'view'...but having been to SF dozens of ties I don't feel it necessary to pay up for a view when I want the room to sleep...great shower...clean as a whistle....quiet.. (we were on the 3rd floor but not over the street)....comfortable and friendly.((I recently gave a so-so review to a Hyatt in San Jose and if the fellow who berated me for that review stayed at the Grand Hyatt he would understand what I meant when I said the San Jose property was NOT what one expects of a Hyatt.),1-Jun-14,5
This hotel was recently renovated and was a great stay for my mom and I. The location is in Union Square and it is right across from Starbucks and close to a few diners to grab breakfast. The room was very comfortable and modern. I really enjoyed staying here are would definitely stay here again.,1-Jun-14,5
"We stayed here for the last leg of our honeymoon. It's a nice hotel with modern & comfortable rooms. Reception staff are great & concierge are also excellent. Breakfast is good with a range of choices. Location is excellent, I would recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay in San Fran!",1-Jun-14,4
"We didn't know what to expect from this hotel but since we arrived everyone was ready to help us out. We were amazed by the customer service we got from every single employee. Once we got to our very home-like rooms we were surprised by how everything was prepared for us to stay there. When we finally laid down we all just said ""wow!""; the beds are SO good and oh so comfortable.The location, the beds, the service, the lobby, everything is just perfect. I would absolutely recommend it and will definitely go back in the future.Thank you for an amazing vacation!",31-May-14,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is like having a luxury vehicle which you cant drive because there is no fuel in it.When you pay the kind of money they charge, you would expect the basic stuff to work.1. My booking was for a king bedroom and what I got was a double queen room.2. Squeaky elevators make you feel like you are in some 1960s building where there is some bloke pulling your elevations with a pulley. The elevators take unbelievable time to arrive and when they do, you hardly get space to stand.3. The Air conditioning in the room would not work.4. There is no water pressure in the bathrooms.The rooms are equipped with the most chic and trendy stuff, but if you dont have the air conditioning in order and you dont have enough pressure in the water whats the point?I would never like to see a service man come into my room when I am on a vacation to repair the water pressure or air conditioning. I pay the hotel good money to ensure that this is taken care of. Unfortunately this happened at the ""Grand"" Hyatt and to my surprise, the guy could only fix the air conditioning and could do nothing about the water pressure.Location of the hotel is very good and the restaurant in the hotel, ""One Up"" serves some good food.Overall I do not think this hotel is value for money. I would not stay here again and I will not recommend this to anyone.",30-May-14,1
"The hotel is very well situated. The rooms are small but functional. Despite my platinum status, we could get no higher than the 5th floor because the hotel was booked over Memorial Day weekend; there was some minor street noise but it wasn't terrible. The hotel is modern and seems to have been recently renovated. It was very clean and the staff were universally responsive and friendly. We enjoyed the on-site restaurant for breakfast and snacks; while pricey, it was convenient and very good.",30-May-14,4
"Just spent 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco with my wife and 11 year old daughter and had a really enjoyable stay. Before travelling we requested a room on a high floor, and we're given floor 32 with a fantastic view. Our room had a single King bed which would have been just about ok for the three of us, but we asked for a roll away bed for our daughter which the hotel provided at no extra charge. From check in to check out, all the hotel staff we came across were friendly and helpful-a special mention for Dave in the Club Lounge, who went out of his way to make us feel welcome. The lounge is on the 32nd floor and we had access, which I wasn't expecting. The views from the lounge are spectacular. The room we had was modern-the bed was very comfy, and the bathroom well appointed with a walk in shower.The hotel is conveniently located a block away from Union Square, near all the shops, the cable car lines and many restaurants. It is a pleasant area to stroll around, particularly round by Grace Cathedral which is only a few blocks away up the hill.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt and will definitely book there again if we come back to San Francisco (which I'm sure we will as we loved it).",30-May-14,5
This hotel had a perfect location for my first visit to San Francisco. Many key landmarks were within relatively easy walking distance. We had to wait on a long line to check in over the Memorial Day holiday but the wait was made pleasant with free appetizers and drinks. Free internet and comfortable rooms were also great!,29-May-14,4
"We were delighted with the look of the hotel ... it looks incredibly stylish, and is impressive from the moment you walk into the reception area. I like the open feel of the reception area, with no long counter separating you from the reception staff, and the staff are very attentive to your needs whenever you walk past.The mezzanine level is great as well, and the cocktail bar is a lovely venue in the evenings.The room impressed us when we checked in, with the automatic and motorised blackout blinds, the impressive smart televisions. We were pleased with the free wifi (more hotels really need to realise this is a must nowadays - unless they have something to hide and don't want guests on social media!)The room looked great, the appliances worked great, and the beds were plush and luxurious.Where the hotel is let down, is some of the little things you wouldn't normally notice in a hotel, but that make a huge difference to your quality of stay ...- the first was the fact that we had a large gap underneath our room door (in places it was just under an inch!). This meant that you could hear every single noise in the corridor (including whispered conversations), and conversely, the people in the corridor could hear everything from inside the room. It's incredible how much a night's sleep can be disturbed by footsteps, doors, conversations & luggage and the movements of hotel staff. In the end, we used the spare blanket in the wardrobe as a slight noise buffer in front of the door, but this was not very successful;- the second thing was that the aircon just did not seem to work. We lowered the temperature on the control panel to it's coldest setting (which is only 18Â°C / 64.4Â°F), but this made absolutely no difference. The room was not cooling down. We rang reception, and asked if someone could look into it while we were out for the day, which they said they would. There was no change that night. In speaking to other guests, they noticed the aircon in their rooms wasn't working properly, either, and the aircon in the gym was also ineffective, making for a hot gym area. To look at the systems, the panels seem to say that they're set at a comfortable temperature, but the reality is that the air temperature doesn't seem to reflect the same thing, with the air temperature being far too warm.So, while we loved the location, the design, the staff, the wifi and the televisions, we didn't get a good night's sleep, which is - after all - what you want most from a hotel.This hotel is lovely, but if you can find some way of getting a room with a door that fills the frame and an air conditioning system that works, then do.",29-May-14,4
"The hotel rooms are typical San Francisco...not very big, but that's what you get there unless you're willing to pay and arm and a leg. The Hyatt staff is very nice, very helpful. I was there 4 years ago and I have to say overall the people in service positions in SF are much nicer and friendlier than they were 4 years ago. Not sure why but it was obvious.",29-May-14,4
Great location perfect for my business needs ...central and easy to get to and from the location...would urge you to pay up for the Bay view ...requires a higher floor north of 20th for best views...the rooms are plesantly appointed and roomy enough for business or pleasure...staff very helpful... Room got abit stuffy during the night... not sure why...was told that they shut down the AC...not a very good idea...Food in the Hotel was decent and easy to get in and out if time was an issue...Solid experience for my business purposes....,29-May-14,4
"We stayed for 4 days in mid May. The hotel staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful.The hotel room was large enough to accommodate 3 adults in the room with no problem. The rooms were extremely neat and clean. The location was great to access Chinatown, numerous upscale shops and resturants. We did alot of walking and felt very safe in this area. We did a 2 day hop on/hop off bus tour(BigBus) that worked out great for first time visitors to the area and there was a stop two blocks from this hotel. Would certainly recommend this hotel to family and friends.",28-May-14,5
Read several prior reviews. Food in Club solid and staff extremely pleasant. Steve at front desk most helpful. Only two negatives. Later in night they shut AC down and this is annoying! Secondly don't take room on Union Sq side. Too much construction noise. As others have stated location is peerless. Joann secured hard to get brunch reservations. Again biggest plus is can do attitude of staff.,28-May-14,4
"I stayed here for 5 nights on a business trip. The hotel is nicely located in Union Square so it is easy to get around from there. The room was fine, clean and quiet. The restaurant is great - I ate there for a few breakfast and dinner meals and the food was good. The staff was very nice.",28-May-14,5
"Airline lost our luggage and the hotel supplied an extensive ""emergency package"". Thank you!Every staff member we encountered was super friendly. The Grand Club Lounge served a nice little breakfast and the hors d'oeuvres in the evening were good as well.Upgraded to a ""Bay"" view and our room was on the 21st floor. It was not high enough to really see the bay over the buildings so next time I would not except unless it was the 25th floor or high.Room was very nice as was the bathroom. I liked the decor of the entire hotel actually! I would return to this hotel for sure.",28-May-14,5
"I recently travelled to the Hyatt for a business event. They have upgraded the place recently, and its quite nice. The lobby is the newer Hyatt intimate casual theme, where you wander aimlessly and end up bumping into a staff standing at a bar table with a PC :). Checkin is pretty easy. Poor attempt at humor. Rooms are nice, clean and modern. One can tell they were reno'd. Nicer newer furniture, but old HVAC system (Read here noisy). The desks are a built in wall unit that oddly enough are totally functional. For example. Sitting at the desk working, on a call etc, one cannot see the TV. Because its all built into the wall, its restricting. The TV has a swing arm, but its llimited. Cool feature though, there is a PC interface on the wall at the desk so one could put their PC onto the TV for say work, Netflix etc. Speaking of internet. Its slow. The upgrade is faster, but its expensive. On the upper end of what I pay for hotel web.I didn't get to the gym or restaurant, wasn't there long enough . Room service was good, but spendy. there is a starbucks across the street for the morning java, but its heaving, literally lined up out the door all AM.Taxis. Be careful I honestly don't know how San Fran taxi drivers get their license, cause I had 2 that didn't know my destination downtown (other large hotels, really?) and didn't know MY hotel - get in the taxi say 10 blocks away, say Grand Hyatt, and they pull out their GPS and start asking questions in poor English. I actually got out of 1 at the Hyatt front door and told the concierge that guy should not be allowed to get Hyatt guests, he is totally lost. From there on I made sure they knew where they were going before I got in. I walked away from several when they had no clue.",28-May-14,5
"Stayed here during the Cisco Live conference In May. It is right next to Union Square. While our 7th floor room didn't have a view, we were still impressed at the cleanliness and how comfortable it was. The bed especially was so comfortable which made it hard to get up in the morning. We did have the hotel buffet breakfast. We was spectacular-all types of fruit, cold and warm oatmeal, egg, bacon, sausage, yogurt, pancakes, and so much more. It was $25 for each adult which was expensive, but super delicious. The staff was nice. The valet parking was $62 and self parking was $41. We had a rental car so we done self parking. Overall great stay.",28-May-14,5
"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF while attending a conference. The room was spacious, modern, and clean. I had a view of Union Square which was fantastic! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I used the concierge services a couple of times and they were very helpful. The hotel is centrally located close to shopping, dining and tourist attractions. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to SF. ",28-May-14,5
"Stayed here for 3 nights during this past Memorial Day weekend with my 18 & 20 yr old sons. I booked Bay View room and got exactly that. On the 25th floor and has a Superb view of the Bay and Alcatraz and without a doubt the extra $25 or whatever the per night difference was! The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect. Super easy and close walk to Chinatown. Easy to get to cable car stop at Powell & Market. Very easy to get to anyplace and anything you needed and the surrounding area was well populated and felt very safe even at night. We went to a Giants game on Sat. night and walked there. Probably close to a mile and a half but it's a non-hilly route and hundreds of others walking to (and back from) the game so again, very safe.The hotel itself was very nice. Clean, comfortable room. All of the staff was helpful and friendly but the Concierge staff was exceptional. They really made a difference and had quick answers to all of our questions. Provided many good suggestions re: restaurants and very helpful with transportation options when needed. The only small disappointment was that the top floor bar which I'd seen in the hotel information no longer exists. I was told that during the remodel of a year or so ago it was turned into banquet space. I will without a doubt stay here on my next visit to the city and recommend it to friends and family!",27-May-14,5
"We stayed for 3 days in mid May. In all respects, we found the hotel to be an ideal base for our visit to San Francisco. The location was perfect and the staff was very helpful. Our room on the 19th floor was very comfortable with a great view of Union Square.We had breakfast at the hotel each morning .Although breakfast is expensive, it was very good and convenient.I would strongly recommend the hotel",27-May-14,5
"Great location! Easy walk to anywhere. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We especially enjoyed Dante and Jaime in the bar upstairs. Excellent service, and if you go, you must try the Moscow Mule! Best drink ever! Although they kept mentioning this special copper cup that they used to serve them in, but apparently they would disappear as fast as they got them in. Anyway....the hotel is awesome! We hired a town car through the hotel and it was a pleasant ride to and from the airport. Cab to the ballpark was about $10. Our room was on the twentieth floor with tiny bay views. Paid extra for bay view, but ask for higher so you can see more. Bed was comfy. Room was quiet even though we were by an ice machine. Slept like a rock! Bathroom amenities were restocked plentiful everyday. Short on hot water one day, but apparently the issue was fixed quickly. We did not try the restaurant but had room service one morning of coffee, champagne, and OJ and it arrived quickly. The coffee pot in the room is your standard hotel one cup pot, but the room service coffee was so much better! Valet was a little spendy, but it's San Francisco. We didn't pull the car out once. We would stay here again in a heart beat!",27-May-14,5
"Very once hotel.Pros:.Very central.Goo value for money.Staff are very helpful.clean hotels room.Spacious hotel room.Nice bathroom with shower and bath.v comfortable beds.The gym is excellent, big, all new equipment and looking over the city.Cons:.More of a business hotel.No bar in the lobby.we didn't like the standing check in- bit weird.The rooms are connected so you can hear everything in the next room. We had 4 teenaged next to us who decided at 4am in the morning to party in their room. When we called reception they said they couldn't do anything about it..",27-May-14,4
"Booked 3 nights, had a room on the 33rd floor, great views. Rooms clean and comfortable. Close to all transport and shopping. We had buffet breakfast each morning only because it was included in the room deal. Had the car parked by valet parking and didn't see it until we booked out, that was expensive but was a hire car (had to do something with it).",26-May-14,5
Recently renovated with a upscale modern feel. Great views of the city and bay from our 29th floor room. The upgrade charge of about $25 was worth it. Ron at the front desk very helpful as were the concierge staff. George in the dining room was great. if only they had not moved the bar/dining from the top (36th floor i think) to the 2nd level this would be 5 stars. Missed that view with Makers Mark.,26-May-14,4
"My first stay in both San Francisco and at Hyatt. I stayed for a week during a conference and would definitely stay again. The staff was super friendly. The room had a great view of the city looking towards ATT Park and just a short walk to the Moscone Center where the conference was. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom had nice hot water and good pressure. My only criticism would be the slow internet (which was free and is fairly typical at most hotels I stay at) and the slow response time on the TV while changing channels (again, fairly typical). I would definitely stay at this hotel again",26-May-14,4
This hotel has nice rooms but they are not very quiet. There was a lot of outside noise. After our second night there was no hot water in the morning. During our last night a large party was going on in a nearby room until 3 am. Security finally shut it down at 3.,26-May-14,3
"I stayed 4 nights on a business trip and it is a good hotel well located very close to Union Square and a very short walk to Market Street. The room was large and comfortable, well equipped and included free wifi. The bar was a little non descript and the food we ordered was pretty bland. It was just a snack but there are a lot of good eateries outside the hotel that are better and a lot cheaper.",25-May-14,4
"I would gladly stay at this Grand Hyatt again. My reaction upon entering my room was ""this feels tight""...small like a European room. Next thoughts were ""it is quite sexy."" The room featured a huge window with a great city / water view and an automatic shade with controls between the beds. The style of the room was very contemporary and also a bit European in feel with rich wood and leather accents...including the trash can. There were convenient snaking reading lights mounted by the beds. Slow closing toilet lid. Then for good measure there were buttons by the door for ""welcome"" and ""leave"" options that automatically turned on/off lights and lowered/raised the window shade. Unusual features that just made the room feel sexy in spite of its size. It had a mounted safe and small fridge.Only gripes with the room were disappointing shower pressure and the window, which you could slide open just a crack, would sometimes move with the outside winds.When I arrived for some reason my reservation was not in the system but after a few minutes the very pleasant staff figured a way to accommodate my 2 night stay even though no availability was expected on the second night. The reception area was very different than the typical desk. The staff kind of wanders around a three point pedestal that doesn't separate them from guests...unusual but made the interaction more intimate.The gym was nice as they come. The elevator to the floor it's on opens to an area for stretching, stepping, or ball exercises that was large enough for probably a dozen people to work. I wondered if that was it before turning the corner to a well equipped area with sophisticated cardio machines, weights, and machines. There was even a healthy diet vending machine.As others have said the hotel is located in the heart of San Francisco action within walking distance or short cab ride to lots of things to do.",24-May-14,5
"I attended the Cisco conference in San Francisco last week and stayed at the Grand Hyatt. I am normally a Hilton guy but they were fully booked. From the moment I arrived at the Grand Hyatt I was treated like royalty. From the experience at the front desk all the way to my room I felt like the king in a palace. The rooms are nothing short of amazing, they are decorated in a very elegant and contemporary theme. The rooms are a great size and have push button controls for the entire room right at the bed. If you are going to visit San Francisco I highly recommend staying at the Grand Hyatt.",24-May-14,5
"At the lobby you will be greeted by their cheerful concierge before entering a poshy lobby that coaxed you comfortably into homely mood. Their room was considered spacious, not huge. Beds comfortable and soft, though i thought it could be better for a 5 star Hyatt!Location is definite a win. It is near to a lot of shopping and restaurants.On the overall I would think the lobby is prettier than their room! So if you are paying more than USD 300, I would go for another hotel. There are so many hotels in San Francisco, NO FRET!http://missconneckions.blogspot.sg/2014/05/i-found-success-in-my-old-neighborhood.htmlHappy searching for a hotel! Point to note: San fran is considered a walking city... so it isn't too far from anywhere if you stick to the city-centre. Avoid the blacks dodgy areas though... they do look quite shaddy. Try looking for a spot near the harbour,,, better seafood for dinner!",22-May-14,4
"Stayed at the Hyatt for 3 nights in early May. I chose this hotel for its location and have stayed in other Hyatts so was expecting a comfartable stay. It was what I was expecting and better. The service was fantastic, very polite and and helpful. The room was clean and moderate in size and the views from my room on the 23rd floor was great. Location is perfect for anyone wanting to explore the city as you are near the cable car, tour buses and the BART. Also the shopping disctrict is right on your doorstop. Breakfast is tasty and staff chatty. My only negative would be the noise from adjacent room as you are able to hear people chatting. Well worth a stay.",22-May-14,5
"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Grand Hyatt. First impressions were excellent. The lobby area was clean and sweet. Not too big, but had verything it needed. Staff everywhere to help with luggage from the car and then to the room. Check in was smooth and faultless. We were cheked into floor 5 and room 520. Had a lovely view of Union Square and and Macy's! Though be warned that there is a fair boit of buildwork going on around union Square and in the evenings especially at the weekend it was rather noisy. We felt that the floor we were on was just too noisy. Would have been a better on a high floor with less noise. The room itself was lovely. Had safe, Fridge, Iron, Hairdryer. The bed was lovely and comfortable. Location was unbeatable for us. 2 min walk to union Square and right next to All shops. China Town as only 2 blocks away, though was rather dissapointed that it all closed down by 10pm! Would definatley stay again, though making sure we had a higher floor.",22-May-14,4
"Great location, good hotel and good service.Electric Curtains, great view if you can get a room on the square. Service was good.The only 2 drawbacks: -breakfast is very expensive (around $28) if you don't have it included in the package.-TV programming is very bad and lacking. no HBO, no showtime, very basic channels, could not even watch champions league game.Overall I enjoyed my stay and it is a very good hotel.",21-May-14,4
"Excellent stay half a block from Union square. Super comfortable beds, updated rooms. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great location for exploring downtown with Chinatown nearby as well. Numerous restaurants/shops all within easy walking distance. Lobby is small, but who wants to hang out in the lobby? Great location for exploring downtown SF and highly recommended. Will definitely return in future.",20-May-14,5
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt! The hotel staff was wonderful. The location is at Union Square providing easy access to many fun things in San Francisco. The room was immaculate! The only negative is there is a bit of street noise if you are on a lower floor. We loved our stay!,19-May-14,4
"The Grand Hyatt has been my ""go to"" hotel for years in San Francisco. Recently updated, each of the rooms are modern and the beds are super comfy. Most importantly, the service is top notch! I highly recommend this hotel. If you are a regular, they never fail to remember your name. The staff at this hotel takes pride in their work and they actually care. Simply amazing. PS - Sneak to the 36th floor for the views, incredible!",18-May-14,5
"I think that this hotel is a no mistake choice due to location (which is perfect near Square Union); if you choose it, one will understand why (hop on hop off busses the perfect way to get initially oriented, renowned cable car next corner, big shopping area etc etc). Overall good hotel, rooms and service. It is advisable to take from the hotel some day trips like Yosemite, Napa Valley etc. I did not regret one minute...",18-May-14,5
"From the moment we stepped through the door the Grand Hyatt offered us a great experience. We utilized the web check-in option and when we noted our arrival time of 12 noon didn't expect to receive an email advising us our room was ready 2 hours before check in, tick number one. Tick number two came when I inquired regarding a late checkout and reception staff were more than accommodating.Location is top notch, for me Union Square is the epicentre of San Fran and it was so easy to branch out in all directions either on foot, bus or trolley car. I must admit though USD6 for the trolley ride can be a little steep if you are only going one or 2 stops.Rooms are decorated with an earthy modern design and offered more than enough room for us. I'm not a fan of showers over baths but at least this one wasn't too difficult to get in an out of. I am a fan of tea and coffee making facilities in room and unfortunately the only thing on offer was a drip filter in the room, a quirky idea but it was missing a part and there wasn't any milk in the fridge to have with it only that revolting powdered chemical ""creamer"" mix. Another great option on offer is a morning breakfast bar in the foyer offering Starbucks coffee, fruit, cereals and pastries etc. A great option to grab something light and take back to your room rather than a full breakfast in the restaurant. We visited the bar on a couple of occasions and the staff were very engaging and helpful. As we weren't overly hungry one night we ordered a snack off the bar menu and it was lovely. A few tips for San Fran... don't bother with shuttles from the airport, at approx. $50 the taxi and speedy trip was worth the $20 extra. Carry USD1 notes at all times for public transport as they don't give change. Don't bother with duty free alcohol, it is so much cheaper at Walgreens or any grocery store.And lastly for a hotel in such a busy location we had absolutely no traffic noise on the 20th floor.",17-May-14,4
I stayed here for x5 nights on my honeymoon and we were very happy with the level of service and room size. Excellent location too. Our only criticism was the pillows...way too soft we stayed on level 3 and asked twice to be placed on a higher floor. The cleaners started vacuuming outside our door and asking for cleaning at 8.30am!!! Way too early. ,17-May-14,4
"We were very happy with our recent stay at the Grand Hyatt. We spent the extra money to get the ""city view on a higher floor"" and were happy with Room 2803 - very neat city view. The hotel lobby was ALWAYS very busy, no matter what time of day. I would highly recommend doing the web check-in and web check-out (which we did, and it was very easy and efficient).The bed was relatively soft, so it wasn't the best night of sleep, but the pillows were amazing, and the overall level of the room was great...very modern and updated. Extremely clean. Transportation in the area was pretty easy...we took a bus a few blocks from the hotel to get down to the Alcatraz tour pier, took a trolley car on our way back, and were close to the BART to go to/from the airport. We even took a Metro to AT&T Park for a Giants game, and then just walked back, which wasn't bad. Although we didn't use it, we checked out the hotel's gym, which was GREAT!!! We wish we had a gym like this to use...amazing view from the gym too, as it was on the 2nd floor from the top. You can also go up to the top floor for a wonderful view of the city.Great stay, and we felt it was a good value for the level of hotel, especially as compared to other area hotels.",16-May-14,4
"When looking for a place to stay there are usually a few brands that you can count on to provide a nice upscale room in a great location. Hyatt is one of those brands. We booked a king room with a city and bay view. The room was very clean and was furnished in a modern tone. The rooms are not large but they are adequately sized. We had some amazing evening views of the city and the bay.The hotel also has a nice bar area that is very relaxing. We did not dine at the hotel because we met some friends for dinner near the wharf. We also left the next day very early to make a drive to Lake Tahoe so we did not have breakfast at the hotel. I felt this hotel is in a great location no matter what you want to do in SF. The only complaint I have is one regarding a hotel staff member. My wife left her cell phone in our room and we realized this about 50 feet from our room when we were leaving. One of the cleaning staff saw us leave the room and then when we asked to be let into the room to get her phone, the staff person refused and told us we needed to go to the front desk. I was kind of irritated because she saw us leave the room with our luggage. If we were not the room tenants, what were we doing in that room? She could have called the front desk to verify that we were the guests in that room and that would have saved me the trip down many floors and then back up again. But by midday I changed my mind and realized she was just doing her job. It was clearly our fault for not making sure we had everything with us when we left the room. I will definitely stay here again when in SF.",16-May-14,4
"This. Hyatt is direct on Union Sq and has a good overall quality. The standard rooms are small but clean and kind of modern. The side with the bay view is great, wake up in the morning with sunshine, the bed quality is excellent . The lobby is a negative point, very small and not that many seats too. Not convenient for some talk meetings. The service is good but not over friendly. Overall a good business and (premium) tourist hotel. It can be pricy in the hot season and when the city is booked well. The gym is good and has a great view of the bay.",16-May-14,4
"First time in San Francisco and this hotel exceeded our expectations. Great location and the room was beautiful. It had a nice view and the restaurant was good. The customer service from the staff was excellent, very friendly.",16-May-14,4
Room was great with breathtaking city view. Room service was excellent - most of all we enjoyed the delicious breakfast - the location is so central with Union Square a few steps away -- would definitely choose Hyatt when back in San Francisco,15-May-14,4
"The check-in was fast and friendly, the lobby was modern and tasteful, and the rooms were classic and comfortable. The views from the top floor (all conference rooms) was worth the elevator ride - don't miss the chance! The location was close to shopping, a park and a cable-car stop. The room had electric shades that could be dropped to make the room totally dark or you could leave them open for a view of the city lights. The only thing that was less than excellent was the work-out facility. Stationary machines in the actual work-out room, but to lift weights, stretch or do yoga you were in the hallway where the elevators opened up.",14-May-14,4
"Enjoyed our stay in the hotel which was renovated recently. The room is large, bathroom is nicely renewed with contemporary design. Our room has the view of the Union Square and it's walking distance to lots of shopping, restaurants and parks. It maybe a bit noisy when there are shows at the Union Square but it usually doesn't start until 9:00 am. Their gym is well equipped and is located on the 35th floor of the hotel with a spectacular view of the City and the ocean. Do not miss the chance to see a better view from there. In general, great hotel in the best location. Loved it.",14-May-14,4
"I stayed a week at this hotel on business. Check-in and check-out was very efficient and making use of the online facilities made it even better.I was a little disappointed by the room (not as good as some Hyatt hotels). There was an ice machine right outside the door that made a noise 24hrs a day so not a great start. The bathroom was good but the shower was poor. The rest of the room was very good - comfy bed, good facilities and tech.I ate breakfast a couple of times and the first time I had to wait 10mins to be seated and a further 10mins to be served - not great.I ate dinner twice in the lounge restaurant - the quality and quantity were excellent but the price was very high for hotel food.In summary, very good hotel, great location, good service and would stay again, but look out for ice machines, don't be in a rush for breakfast and be prepared to pay a lot for the food / drink.",14-May-14,4
"From the moment I walked in, I was appreciated. I'd received Diamond status via a challenge, and had 2 free nights from signing up for the credit card. I was given a room on the 32nd floor, with a floor to ceiling glass door covering the western wall. The views were incredible. I had access to the Grand Club lounge and used it often. The views from the Club equaled or exceeded those from my room. The food at the Club was average, but adequate, and the coffee machine I enjoyed. My room was small, but large enough to contain a sitting area in front of the window. I would have liked to step outside for pictures, but the patio door opened only a few inches. The bathroom is comfortable, and decorated with a modern touch. The staff were welcoming. I would recommend the hotel to anyone.",13-May-14,5
"Check in was flawless, and you can't beat the location of the hotel in the center of the downtown. The valet parking was stiff, $60 per day!The room facing the Union Square and partial ocean view was fantastic. The size of the room was adequate, and the bathroom was nice enough.Didn't use any of restaurant in the hotel, but my wife and I have used the grand executive lounge extensively. Nice view and atmosphere, but strange that we had to pay for the alcoholic beverages!! The breakfast was OK, not great but adequate.Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who visit SF and want to stay near the center of the downtown since all the department stores are nearby!",13-May-14,4
"Decent hotel with great facilities and proximity to the famous SF Union Square, which is the heart of access to the financial district and shopping haven. Only setback is noise and chatters from second floor bar during the weekends.",11-May-14,4
"The hotel is of a good standard but the location is fantastic, right next to Union square at the heart of San Francisco. The food and drink within the hotel is very pricy so I'd recommend going elsewhere to wine and dine. Other than that a pleasant stay.",9-May-14,4
"First stay here and thoroughly recommend, the location on Stockton St is just one block from Union Square so shoppers paradise, all the staff I had contact with were polite and helpful. The hotel has been refurbished recently and my 14th floor room was spacious and very comfortable, bathroom has a modern feel with one of those odd shaped but shallow wash basins, fabulous over bath shower, plenty of decent sized, soft, fluffy towels. There is a sort of dressing room joining the bedroom and bathroom, with a welcome vanity unit, plenty of space for ladies to do hair and make up and a magnifying mirror, just a shame there wasn't a better quality of light in that area.I would suggest familiarising yourself with the room before heading out for jetlagged dinner and drinks ... the blackout blind is in fact electronically operated, but there is NO switch anywhere near the window, they are located just inside the door and in the panel at each side of the bed!The large flat screen tv is brilliantly improved with the built in TV Programme/Channel guide on screen, first time in years I've actually managed to watch a whole tv programme in a US hotel! Room service is also ordered through the interactive TV, mine arrived in about 15-20 mins, very good. During my stay there were some strong winds blowing and some strange noises seemed to be coming from the wall near the door, thought I was imagining things for a while, but when I woke in the morning, there was a letter under my door, explaining that in such conditions it is normal for high rise buildings shifting with the pressure of the wind to make such sounds.On this occasion I didn't use the hotel bars or restaurants, but I have eaten in the top floor restaurant before on Christmas Day and thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the amazing views. Colleagues also commented that the breakfast was very good at the hotel and the 35th floor Gym made working out a pleasure due again to the amazing views.I look forward to my next visit.",8-May-14,5
"The location is great, at Union Square. Initially I chose this hotel because of the location and despite that I read that the service weren't as good as other ""Grand Hyatt"" elsewhere. To my surprise, I had a very warm welcome and check-in staff were great and friendly. We are staying in 2 rooms for 5 adults, so the connecting rooms were definitely to our advantage. One of the room was a corner room which is slightly bigger than the normal room, having a little space between the bed and bathroom where they put in the cupboard and a mini powder/make-up table. The additional space also means that with the additional bed, it wasn't as cramped as I would imagine. Rooms were clean and we enjoyed our stay here!",7-May-14,5
"Treated myself and 2 grown daughters to a couple of nights in the City recently. I always love the Union Square location for its centrality, and because there were 3 of us I wanted a modern location with more room square footage instead of one of the more historic hotels in the area.Hotel has several inviting common areas; we did not eat at the hotel so I cannot comment. The room was nice with comfy beds, frig, coffee maker - and roomy, not spacious. There were not enough ""supplies"" for 3 and someone came promptly after I called.I liked the automated check-in (I checked in thru my iPhone - we were early but our room was ready) and check-out.So - nice room but paid so much for it! ",7-May-14,4
"Due to the connecting door to the adjacent room we could hear just about everything going on next door. Impossible to sleep as long as our neighbor was awake and watching TV, talking to someone on the phone or taking a shower. When we complained to reception they told us that all their rooms with the exception of one per floor have connecting doors. So they were unable to provide us any solution - all they did was to give us access to the executive lounge, which was totally useless to us.Having previously stayed at other Grand Hyatt hotels in Hong Kong, Berlin or Jakarta, I can not understand why the one in San Francisco deserves to be a ""Grand"" Hyatt - there is definitively nothing grand about this hotel. Any airport Hyatt is just as fine.The location is great and the view from our bay view room was spectacular. However if it is important to you to have some privacy in your room and to be able to sleep in a quiet environment, I would recommend to avoid this hotel.",6-May-14,2
"It took 2 days to get the shower head fixed, the elevators did not work one morning and only had de-cafÃ© coffee in the room as they ran out of regular. Finally, the air conditioning unit could not get the room cool. It was a great location but I wish I had stayed at one of the other name brand hotels within the same block or two.",6-May-14,1
"Right next to Union Square in the heart of the shopping and entertainment district of San Francisco, this hotel did not disappoint. Rooms were decent size, and all amenities were already there. Only issue was that the room service ended at 11pm or so, so you may be out of luck after a long day at the office. Otherwise, can't complain!",6-May-14,4
"Totally overcrowded hotel. Have to wait for hours for any of the many lifts that wobble squeak and get stuck from time to time. The hall is so noisy that when the alarm button is being hit by who ever is stuck in it, it takes guests to point this out to security standing there. Staff and bell boys catch rides and when not dispersing chemical smells, talking loud on either cell phones or to each other, or squishing you in an corner w suitcase trollies. The panels are visibly dirty w the same spots for all the time were there. On the whole this hotel's surfaces are not kept clean. Even the carpets on the floors we were staying were not even once seen being vacuumed, with the same small rubbish in the same places in the carpets. Dishes outside rooms on floor often w smelly food took some time to be removed if not days.",5-May-14,3
"check in can be a little confusing,but it is clean,quiet,and reasonably pricedbook as far ahead as you can to get lower rate and check AAA and others asthere are different packagesrestaurant staff and room cleaning are exceptionalvery convenient locationcheck on-line for restaurant couponshighly recommend",5-May-14,5
"This hotel is located near Union Square with lots of great shopping within walking distance. Chinatown is a few blocks away and the waterfront is a 10 minute cab ride. The staff here are very friendly and helpful. Our room package included breakfast for two. I would highly recommend it since the buffet runs about $29 dollars. The quality of the food and the items available are great. There is a coffee bar on the lobby level in the morning or a Starbucks across the street if you just want to grab and go. The rooms are comfortable and clean. Housekeeping was in and out before we returned from breakfast each day. The only downside is the parking. Valet is $61/day or you can self park around the corner for $41/day. There were lines for taxis around dinnertime but we generally didn't wait more than 5-10 minutes. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely come back.",5-May-14,4
"Again at Grand Hyatt, a really nice place to stay in the city, amazing quality-price ratio, totally renewed, now with the new OneUp restaurant and a really good bar on the mezzanine floor. I had a room w a stunning view on SF and I will be back here really soon. Clean, gentle staff, perfect. Thank u so much.",4-May-14,5
"We have chosen this hotel for our stay in SF because is extermely well located on Union Square. It has a public parking across street with (ballet parking). There is anything you may need within 2 blocks distance. Breakfast is fine, sometime you have too wait 15-20 minutes. Room are normal.Worth going to upper floors to have a nice view of the city. There is a gym in floor 36, nice for exercicing with such a view.Reliable concierge advice and recommendations.",3-May-14,4
I stayed at the Grand Hyatt last autumn and enjoyed my stay very much. Clean rooms and fine bathroom and toilet is what I expect from a good hotel and here I was not disappointed. I usually spend quite some time on carefully choosing the places I stay at and my recent search in SF lead me to a couple of hotels one of which was Grand Hyatt.Beautiful views of city center from most rooms. Would go back again!,2-May-14,5
"The hotel is in an extremely convenient location. We were able to walk to the Ferry Building in around 15 minutes. Access to public transport was very easy.We stayed in a room facing Union Square on the 11th floor for five nights. It has a lovely view of the square. The room was comfortable with electric blinds. However, the noise from the street was unbearable. Roadworks on Stockton St took place throughout the night. We could hear machinery chugging away at 3am. Because the floor to ceiling window was not one piece of glass (it was a sliding door though it could not be opened), the wind could be heard howling through the gap. A note was slipped under the door on our last night informing us of the noise due to high wind. A few train tickets were also passed in along with the note. We weren't quite sure what to make of it.There were four of us staying in the room but we were only given 3 sets of towels. We requested for an extra towel when we first arrived but housekeeping did not take note until our very last day. Check in and check out were efficient. Both Mark and Elaine from concierge were very helpful. ",1-May-14,3
"This is a comfortable hotel in an ideal location for shopping and downtown-area sightseeing. Although the property doesn't come across as ""grand"" to me, the service is excellent and the remodel gives it a fresh look. The rooms look and feel quite up-to-date. The onsite restaurant has very nice offerings beyond what one expects from a ""hotel restaurant.""",29-Apr-14,4
"Top hotel. Great service, nice atmosphere and lovely rooms. Had a great 4 night stay here. Only gripe is that the happy hour isn't advertised too well. Ordered many wines assuming it was all half price when it's only certain wines that were. Better advertising would be great. Location is perfect for tourists too.",28-Apr-14,4
"Stayed recently in this hotel for five nights with my friends. After a courteous welcome we were allocated a room on the 11th floor. Room was spotless and looks like the rooms have all been recently renovated.This is a perfect location for Union Square, the surrounding bars, restaurants as well as a block away from the famous cable cars to Fisherman's Wharf. Tour buses also pick up on Union Square. If you visit this hotel and can't get access to the roof top bar just visit the gym on the 35th floor and you can get some amazing views and photographs !Would definitely consider staying here again if I return to San Francisco",28-Apr-14,5
"Stayed here for three nights on arrival to SF from London and were very happy with our stay were allowed to check in a little early which was good.There is not to much going in downstairs in the communal areas but the rooms are new and the hotel is in a great location. I would defintiely consider staying here again on return to SF.I thought the front desk staff were excellent every time we dealt with them and helped my girlfriend out after she fell over and needed so antiseptic and plasters, they were great there and the help was most appreciated.",28-Apr-14,4
"This is perhaps my favourite hotel that I have stayed in thus far.The location is great in Union Square, with lovely restaurants and shopping close by, the staff were fantastic and so helpful, and our room was incredible.We stayed in a Club Room, and it was great to be able to go up to the club lounge, with a great view, to eat breakfast or canapes in the evening.The flatbread in the restaurant was delicious.",27-Apr-14,5
"I stayed at this property with my 8 yr old daughter. We both had a very nice time. The staff was very courteous and helpful. We had a view of Union Square which was beautiful at night when the city was lit up. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I found the lobby to be congested and confusing at times of high volumes as the reception, bellhop, and concierge are not set up conventionally. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which is great because the Starbucks across the street is always packed. Internet access in the rooms was free which was a big bonus. This hotel is located at the center of everything with easy access to everything by public transportation or walking. I would avoid renting a car and parking if possible as the parking fees range between $41-$65 per night. I would definitely recommend this hotel and plan to stay here again on my next visit.",27-Apr-14,4
"Excellent place to stay for a city getaway. Located right in the heart of Union Square, there is ample shopping and dining opportunities within walking distance. The hotel staff is friendly and very professional. Valet & Bellmen service was excellent. Our room was well appointed and extremely comfortable. The view of the city from our room was amazing! I loved looking out at the surrounding architecture. ",26-Apr-14,5
"We stayed here for 6 nights of our honeymoon and enjoyed our visit. The location was great and it was easy to navigate the city from the hotel. It's a shame that the roof top bar was closed and being refurbished as a conference centre as many people said to us that the best views of the city had previously been from the bar. We ate in the hotel on one evening, just having pizza as most of the dishes were beyond our budget. The pizza was good but there are so many great restaurants nearby that it was more appealing to eat out. Despite leaving a decent tip for the maid every day we didn't have our tea/coffee tray replenished unless we specifically asked which was a little disappointing. I've never had this in a hotel before, usually it is replenished as standard. The toiletries were nice and the room was a generous size with a great view. The closet was huge and the fridge was a good size also. The phone charges were extortionate - three times as much to phone the uk as any of the other hotels we stayed in on this holiday!! And the info for costs wasn't easy to find which was frustrating. So, overall the hotel itself was great - very attractive, great location and very clean. However I felt the service was a little lacking and additional costs were too high. I would recommend the hotel due to the positives but would recommend eating out, leaving notes for the maid if you want your coffee replenishing, and avoid using the phone. ",26-Apr-14,4
"The hotel was what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. Location perfect just off Union Square. Greeted by staff as soon as we pulled up to help with luggage and direct to check in was courteous and efficient. The relaxed style of check in and foyer was different but a little messy. The room was clean and size was good. All toiletries and linen were of high quality. We had a room on the 34th floor over Easter and access to the club room on the 32nd floor. Of course it was a busy time so the club room was overflowing with people therefore my rating in lower. The size of the room was not adequate for the amount of people wanting to use it. Sharing tables, waiting for a table and the whole hustle and bustle defeats the whole purpose of a club room. The food selection wasn't great. Minimal. If the club room is not included in your package I wouldn't up grade.",25-Apr-14,4
"First person I met was a wonderfully kind and humble gentleman named Lalit (la-leet). He had a gentle soft smile that let me know immediately I was in good hands.He helped me out of my taxi, collected my bags and off we went into the hotel. When I went to tip him, all I had in cash was a twenty and a single one. He saw my embarrassment and said, ""a dollar is fine maâ€™am please donâ€™t worry about it"" and quickly left to go attend to more arriving guests. Lalit and the staff at Grand Hyatt are attentive, professional and extremely eager to create an enjoyable experience for the guests. Check-in is three art deco kiosks, so theyâ€™re not standing behind a stuffy desk away from you. It's an up close and personal experience, as if to imply weâ€™ll be here. The kiosks were decked out in all the technological fanfare necessary to process your reservation quickly and efficiently. They even had a person push the button for the elevator for me and again stayed right there until it came, held the door as I entered, chatting me up the whole time (awesome service). My accommodations were on the 33rd floor, fantastic view of town and the bay. I couldn't help notice the TV display said, welcome Renda so and so. I grinned and thought to myself; AHA, trying to enter my psyche, with the whole name in lights trick (clever); they already had me at hello.The room is very tastefully decorated in understated elegance. The Grand is huge on technology. YES, I had a learning curve on the TV. The focal point of the room of course is the room length, floor to ceiling window which had a motorized shade (me likey)! At first I could not figure out how to raise the shade on the window so I looked around the room and discovered next to each bed are buttons for the lights and shade. This may not seem like much in making someone happy but it's the little thoughtful things that make your stay more pleasant. I started taking pics of the room like I had never been anywhere before, Iâ€™m goofy!This is a business trip, Iâ€™m only here for one evening, but I would definitely pay to stay here again.",24-Apr-14,5
"I would recommend this hotel to anyone for its great service and value. This was our first trip to San Francisco and opted to stay at Union Square for the great upscale shopping and proximity to better restaurants in the Union Square area which are quite literally right out the front door. We do not enjoy really crowded touristy areas such as the Fisherman's Wharf. We did not regret this decision. We did spend much time at Fisherman's Wharf which is a slow trolley ride away. The trolley's are hard to catch if they are full so be patient. The hotel was clean and updated. We consulted with the concierge daily and they were friendly and efficient in grabbing restaurant reservations, car service and Giants ballgame tickets. I would absolutely recommend this hotel. We routinely stay in five star hotel such as Ritz-Carlton and Mandarin and I would say although not quite as luxurious, this hotel provides a better location and value.",24-Apr-14,5
"Our final hotel of 6 on our USA trip.Had booked a club room for our final stay and was not disappointed. Level 32 with magnificent views across the city.Room was a good size and has all amenities needed,comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom.Made use of the Club lounge and was surprised to find an ""honor bar""? This may be usual in the USA but most other countries we have visited include drinks as part of the Club privileges? Seen some guests filling glasses so high they were flowing over,but guess when your paying,you get your monies worth!! Breakfast was very good and choice excellent. Position of the hotel is excellent and would recommend it on that alone,we walked to Chinatown,shopping and the HoHo buses.All in all met our requirements and was an enjoyable stay,thank you Grand Hyatt.",22-Apr-14,5
"We stayed at the hotel for 5 days when touring the area. The concierge team was outstanding with the ladies efficient, unflappable and very knowledgeable of the local scene. The hotel lived up to its billing and was efficiency personified. The experience was spoilt a touch by a grumpy senior citizen (bespectacled) who was controlling valet and bell boy services. We met him on the last day and were taken aback by his attitude. The rest of the team including the younger lads at the bell desk were proactive and eager to help.Would unhesitatingly stay there again. Inspite of the sole ""grumpy"" Indian valet.",22-Apr-14,4
"Their renovation is a retro 1980 look. Even the stereo could not be used with our iPhones and reminded us of our old stereo system in the 90's; at least the CD player worked! The room space is a bit cramped for 3, thought the bathroom is generously appointed. The hotel has a great location to quickly access Chinatown, the piers or the Union Square shopping areas. The staff was generally helpful. The breakfast is delicious but very pricey.",20-Apr-14,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights while attending a conference and couldn't have been more pleased. The location is excellent. Right in the middle of the Union Square shopping district, walking distance to Chinatown, Market st, and the Bay. Rooms are well appointed and very clean. Housekeeping staff was friendly and excellent. The only complaint I have about the room is that there is a large gap at the bottom of the door which lets in light at night and noise from the hallway. The rest of the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Nice bar and good restaurant. Very professional banquet staff and nice convention rooms. Not enough elevators however, at peak times the wait was considerable. Even so, I would highly recommend this hotel.",20-Apr-14,5
"Location can't be beat. To the south you have union square, to the west is Chinatown. It's so near both places but far enough not to be noisy. Due to jet lag, my 9yr old son sleeps until 12nn. And the hotel is quiet and has black out drapes. Room is spacious and very clean. King bed is big enough to fit 3 persons comfortably. Service is excellent. From the reception to bell service to the operator to engineering. Very fast service. Didn't have to wait long when I ask for something. It may be a little bit ore expensive than other hotels, but it's definitely value for money. You get more than you pay for.",20-Apr-14,5
"Excellent location being barely a block away from the center of Union Square. The hotel is otherwise quite average and the premium you pay is for its location rather than the rooms. Rooms are decent but could be a bit more spacious, bathroom quite standard, generally not much surprises.",20-Apr-14,3
"Ok. Check in can be a little annoying. They seem to move a bit slow, but after that everything was great. DO NOT try to check in before 3:00 pm, the room will not be available. This place is busy, especially on the weekends. We checked in on a Monday afternoon, not a problem. We were on the 14th floor, no complaints. Had a very nice double bed room. But the location of the hotel is superior. One block to Union Square and one block to Chinatown gate. Ask the concierge for their list of restaurants within walking distance, it's a great list. Also, we didn't need a car. If you are flying in to just stay in San Francisco, you really don't need to rent a car. I found that the CHEAPEST BEST transportation to get around the city was ÃœBER. If you do not know about Uber, download the app for your smartphone and pre-register your credit card. The service is AWESOME. It's a flat rate ( no meters running) and tip is included. They just bill your credit card directly and there is no hassles. Only $40 from SF airport to the hotel (UberX) or if you need a bigger car it is $65 for the Black Car option. Then we used UberX to get down to the Wharf for $7 which includes the tip! The cable cars are fun too, and you should definitely ride them but it is $6 per person one way. All in all, the hotel was excellent and we enjoyed our stay. P.S. Check out Dylan's Tours for an excellent tour. It picks you up only one block from the hotel and is incredible and fun!",20-Apr-14,5
"Check-in: We arrived on Sunday, after an early flight from the East Coast, delayed at a stop over, then getting off at the wrong Bart Station, walked the wrong direction for 3 blocks, passing through some not so safe looking area, before we found our way to the hotel. Needless to say, we were exhausted by the time we arrived at the hotel. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted warmly by Paul, who took care of our check-in process. I loved their reception desks. They were arranged in a way that allowed more privacy and individual attention. I had requested a room away from common area on a higher floor. Paul spent the time looking for the perfect room and asked which criteria (quiet or higher floor) has a higher priority. And wanted to know if we wanted higher floor for view or to be away from the street noise. He ended up finding the perfect room on the 11th floor facing Union Square for us. He provided wonderful customer service and really made us glad that we chose this hotel. It was the best check-in experience I ever had. The room was modern, clean and nicely done. It had a mini-fridge, which was convenient to store the cream puffs I got from Beard Papa. Even though the room was on the 11th floor, we could still hear some street noises, but it was not too bad. The room had a nice view of the Union Square and Macys. There is complimentary wi-fi in the room (not every hotel in the area provide the wi-fi in the rooms for free). The hotel location was convenient for us. We went to Chinatown to pick up breakfast everyday when we were in town. Starbucks, Walgreen, the bus stop, and the trolley stop were all very close. We were able to go to the tourist attractions (Lombard Street, Fisherman's Wharf, Crissy Field...etc) taking the trolley and the buses. Concierge: We went to the concierge desk to ask about the Muni passes. The person we spoke to seemed preoccupied. When we asked, she simply told us the passes can be purchased at the Walgreen. And nothing else. We asked about the price for the passes. And she told us the wrong price. It was not a big deal. We could totally look up the information online. But I would expect the concierge to have the correct information for something basic like the price of the Muni passes and to be more helpful. Other than the minor misinformation from the concierge, we had a wonderful stay. We will definitely choose this hotel again when we are in town.",20-Apr-14,5
"This is an update to a previous positive review for the property.On my recent stay, I checked in on a Saturday. I asked for a quiet room and the front desk person seemed unfamiliar with the property because they put me on the 10th floor, facing Union Square and with my front door less than 2 feet from 3 other rooms (very odd configuration). Not only did I get to hear everyone coming in and out of their rooms, but the Union Square noise and overnight construction (woke me up at 3am on 4/16) were intolerable. Additionally, on day 1-3 of my 4 day stay my non-smoking room was filled with marijuana smell off and on. My guess is that hotel staff were smoking in a service hallway that somehow connected to my air duct, or there was someone constantly smoking on the street near an intake. The smoke didn't appear to be coming from neighboring rooms.After two nights of this madness, I asked the front desk staff to move me to the other side of the building. They had rooms on the other side, just nothing on a higher floor, which I said was fine. He said he would take my name and room number and see what could be done to get me up higher, as well. I said great, and confirmed with him that I would check-in with the front desk when I returned in late afternoon. When I returned, there were no notes on my account. No one knew anything about what was going on with my move. After explaining this twice now, I was very frustrated and just decided to deal with staying in this terrible room and never returning to the property again. To add insult to injury, the staff I spoke to in the morning had de-activated my room key (I know this because he mentioned that he needed to change that for me because he had realized that I would have to get back in my room when I returned for the day). My number one pet peeve in customer service is people communicating to you that they are taking ownership and will see it through, but then they just let it drop without closing the loop. I'm not complaining about lack of availability to switch rooms (if that was the case even), I'm complaining about the continued missed follow-through by staff at the hotel from check-in to my request to move. As far as facilities go, the surfaces were dusty (need to change the air filters) and the water pressure was terrible. If a neighboring room flushed the toilet or turned on a shower, my shower pressure dropped so low that the toggle between shower and bath faucet was switched. Fun. That happened multiple times during a shower. When I checked into the room, they had doused the place with Febreeze. The only pros I can say about this hotel are that they provide a mini-fridge, and the location is good.",16-Apr-14,2
"Really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt in SF. Excellent location, very close to Union Square and plenty of shopping choices. Speedy check in and check out and housekeeping responded quickly to a couple of requests. Rooms were spacious and very modern and well appointed. We had a room on 5th floor and had a bit of street noise occasionally but not a major issue for us. I would stay here again.",15-Apr-14,4
"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Stockton and was very pleased with the new renovation and upgrade in general. I particularly like this location because I an find everything I need and walk everywhere. But I am most impressed with the concierge desk. Elaine is my favorite go to person whenever I am in town but John, Annie or Lisa all provide wonderful services. Elaine recommended a top notch massage place: Pure Organic. I promise you will not be sorry!",15-Apr-14,5
I stayed in this Hotel with my Family and thoroughly enjoyed the Stay. The staff are nice and the Best part about the Hotel is its proximity to Union Square. Its just Beside the Hotel. There is enough transportation nearby and Also lots of Shopping Option. Overall the Hotel experience was pretty good.,15-Apr-14,4
"We had a quick 2 night stay at the Grand Hyatt for a conference and it was in a wonderful location. The hotel is centrally located in Union Square and within walking distance to everything from shopping, dining, entertainment to Chinatown and the BART. We actually took the BART to the hotel and it was quite convenient. The only negative thing I would comment is that the air was a little stuffy and stale when we entered the room. Of course you don't feel it as much after you get adjusted. The size of the room was decent with all the standard amenities expected at a Hyatt. They have additional items you can request for which is always nice. I've attached a picture of the list for anyone who wants to see.During our down time, we also explored the area a bit. If you contract concierge, they have a full map of the SF area from SoMa (South Market) to Fisherman's Wharf. For those who don't mind walking, we actually walked to Fisherman's Wharf from the hotel. Took us about 25-30 minutes, but it beat having to wait in line for the same amount of time for the trolley.",14-Apr-14,4
"Stayed that the Grand Hyatt San Francisco in April 2014. Modern Hotel, lots of electronic amenities including automatic window shades controlled from your bedside, and a Smart TV that allows you to surf the web, watch movies and order room service among other things.Very comfortable room, of a decent size. Staff were very friendly and accommodating.At one mean at the hotel restaurant called One-Up, well actually the lounge / bar attached to the restaurant, had the One-Up burger it was extremely good.Location is steps from the heart of Union Square - for shopping junkies this is the place to be. Also just a couple of the blocks in the other direction is Chinatown.The only complaint, is that as a Gold Passport - Platinum member, I was not offered a complimentary room upgrade, which was surprising as I understand it the hotel wasn't close to sold out.Highly recommended.",14-Apr-14,4
"The prices were steep like every other place in downtown SF. Location is fantastic. Can walk to most places not involving the harbors/piers in the downtown area.The rooms are clean, apparently updated. No hot tub, but very nice work - out area.Highly recommended.",13-Apr-14,4
At modern Grand Hyatt; ease of checkin/out very much appreciated....comfortable bed...quiet corner room- my new choice for San Francisco stays--great breakfast with excellent service/cozy bar to end the evening,11-Apr-14,4
Love the location. Clean rooms with modern flare. Perfect for San Francisco. The rooms were a little on the small size for our family of 4. Is nice to have the Starbucks in the lobby. The parking fee is outrageous with an added 5$ per night for larger cars that take up the same space. ,3-Apr-14,4
"The Grand Hyatt is a very stylish large hotel, in ultra competitive hotel cultured San Francisco. It's well located next to Union Square, and easy to access. Staff were graceful and accommodating - door were always held open for us.The rooms were recently renovated and lovely - nice warm wood materials, comfy beds, and lovely bathroom fixtures. A nice touch - a sliding door on the bathroom that has an opaque glass window in it. If someone is in the bathroom, the area immediately outside is still lit up.The only thing this hotel could really use is a hot tub. Hard to justify why a hotel of this size and quality wouldn't have one.Overall however, a place I'd gladly stay again, if their rates are reasonable :-)",3-Apr-14,4
"Very modern hotel, very nice. Be aware that room sound isolation leaves much to be desired.Ask for a room in a high floor. Mine in 8th floor was not well insulated against street noises. I wouldn't hesitate to come back but only on a high floor. ",31-Mar-14,4
"In a nutshell this is a great location. A fairly good price for a very nice hotel. Efficient. Modern rooms. Located overlooking Union Square, this is the perfect hub and allows you to walk everywhere and easily find your way around town. Taxi's are easy to find from here. The hotel is newly refurbished and very modern. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. It has a very cool modern vibe and younger audience. The rooms are small but very nice with electronic shades (very cool). The bar is a great place to connect with friends and have a few drinks. I did not eat in the restaurant so I cannot speak to this part of the hotel. But overall I really liked it. I did not give it a 5 because it's not the best place I've stayed in SF, but overall you won't be disappointed.",31-Mar-14,4
"I'm not suggestion that this is a 5 star hotel in terms of hotel ratings, but everything about this place was excellent and deserves an excellent Trip Advisor rating. It is an excellent value! The design is very modern decor, very non-traditional. Service was excellent, rooms very nice with most offering great views. It is an excellent hotel, great value, in a great part of the city.",30-Mar-14,5
"I stayed here as a single traveller last week. It is a great hotel in a superb location. Union Square in a good central place to stay and is close to the shops, bus tours etc. The hotel had great decor and the rooms are spacious and modern. The reception and concierge staff were all really helpful and the customer service was great. It was a bonus having a Starbucks in the lobby! ",30-Mar-14,5
"We travelled with three teen girls and knew I would have trouble finding accommodation in SF. I am so glad we booked at the Grand Hyatt! With 5 people, we needed to book 2 adjoining rooms and they were able to offer a great family rate when I called reservations directly. The hotel is cool, modern, urban and easy to navigate. We added a breakfast package and enjoyed the buffet before a long day of sightseeing. All of the staff was very friendly and unpretentious which I appreciated. Definitely visit the top floor of the hotel for an amazing view. My only complaint is that the beds are too soft.",30-Mar-14,5
"The hotel's renovation really changed its character into a high energy urban hotel, if that's what they were seeking. The decor was nice, the service prompt but not overly fussy and the location is simply unbeatable. The hotel was very open about Stockton Street being closed at Geary and gave alternate directions which where easier than trying to mess with a GPS unit. Overall, a great stay.",26-Mar-14,4
"Myself and a buddy stayed in San Francisco for 4 days as part of a California/Nevada roadtrip and booked this hotel for our stay. We had cut costs throughout the holiday so this was a bit of a treat to kick start the holiday being a fair bit more expensive than our other hotels. It was well worth the cost.The hotel is a relatively easy 30 minute drive from the main international airport and has parking right next door (this is however pretty pricey, though this is to be expected in Downtown San Fran).The hotel itself is smart, modern and very clean and this trend continues in the rooms. Our room came with a fantastic view over Union Square and the city's skyline. The room was beautifully furnished - everything looked brand new and the beds were among the comfiest I have slept in. I know that sounds exaggerated but they genuinely were awesome beds!The hotel is located literally ON Union Square so right by the streetcar (a must do!) and right by a load of high end shops (Tiffany's etc) and a fantastic Cheescake Factory with a roof top seating area. It is a 5 minute walk from the main mall and is in great proximity to AT+T Park (well worth going to a Giants game!) and Fisherman's Wharf etc.I couldn't write this review without giving a mention to the fantastic concierge. The whole team were incredibly helpful and were brilliantly knowledgeable. We were visiting during the Stanislaus Forest fires and thought it would scupper our trip to do some hiking in Yosemite but the concierge advised us on alternative routes to the park and other general tips. Also before heading to the states I looked to buy tickets for Alcatraz (about 2 weeks before our arrival). I had no idea it sold out so quickly so when I went to purchase the tour tickets it emerged that they were gone weeks in advance and that we couldn't go. In a 'Hail Mary' attempt I emailed the hotel to see if they could help. To my (pleasant) shock they managed to arrange tickets to the prison and a city sightseeing bus tour for a great price and even phoned me in England to confirm it all. FANTASTIC service.If you are looking for a great, clean, safe, helpful hotel in the centre of town then look no further!",25-Mar-14,5
"The front desk agent, Paul, was phenomenal! He was very informative and answered all my questions and concerns. I really enjoyed their gym as well. It has an amazing view. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city.",24-Mar-14,5
"I enjoy staying at the Grand Hyatt, we have been there many times. It's close to Union Square and a lot of shopping. This morning I called the valet to get my car and I was looking at the claim card and it showed three little scratches in the back which I knew about. Nothing else. Car comes give card to valet and my wife says there is a scrape and a little scratch on right side front. Valet with pen in hand says oh it's on the card. How could my wife and I both miss that? He said he was going to check the other card at valet station and comes back showing mark on card. What can you do? I wish I has taken a pic of the ticket with my phone before I handed it to the valet. I told him I don't believe him and left. I should have gone him with to valet station. So if you use valet parking be sure to check your car and go to valet station with him. I like the place and will go back but we learned a lesson this time.",23-Mar-14,4
"Recently updated hotel and rooms make this property a pleasure to stay at. The smaller footprint of the hotel and styling make it almost feel like you're in a boutique hotel. There aren't many steps between the front door, to the check in area, to the elevators, and then to your room.The updated room styling is reminescent to some other recently renovated Hyatt properties. Staff service here is very business professional and friendly. The doorman were always eager to welcome and open door for guests. Lyle, one of their bellhops is probably the best bellhop I've come across and is the face of this Grand Hyatt and represents their service level. Steve at check in was also one of the most efficient and smooth check in staff members I've come across.My only frustrating moment of this stay was upon arrival and trying to figure out where ""valet parking"" is. There isn't any type of driveway area and the real estate space is fairly small and you just pull up to the front of the hotel. There wasn't any type of signage to designate valet parking and as i made the 1st pass in front of the hotel the front was full of cars and or taxi's. I must have drove around the blocks 3 times before the cars cleared out and I pulled up and asked if I'm in the right spot for valet parking while checking in. Staff were quick to help and also advised of a self park garage nearby if that was my preference but I wanted to valet.Location is smack in Union Square and it's walkable to all the nearby retail shops. Later in the evening if walking around late at night (after midnight), do practice caution as in most major downtown cities. There are wandering homeless or suspectible people walking around a few blocks away that would make some uneasy.I had a higher floor room facing Union Square and it was nice to gaze at the city lights at night. Everything worked fine in the room and I really liked the big oval wash basin. I would have preferred the room and bathroom to have been a little larger in size as i like roomy rooms, but the room was probably about on par for a downtown size room. The gym facility was nice as it was on a higher floor of it's own. There's a panoramic view facing east looking at the financial district from the treadmills and elipticals. This is a great hotel to stay at and you really can't go wrong with choosing this Grand Hyatt. It's stylish, modern, and the service is superb!",23-Mar-14,5
"I stay in San Francisco quite frequently and I tried the Grand Hyatt to experience something new for a much better price than my typical first choice of the Mandarin. I have also frequented the Embarcadero Hyatt multiple times and the Grand is superior in every single conceivable way. The best thing about my visit was the superb service. It was very surprising and I couldn't have asked for the people to be nicer or more accommodating whether it was the bellman or the front desk. The location is also very good. It is a nice part of town and the financial district is very close. The only possible downside about the location is that the nearest BART station is a couple of blocks away, but that is true for most hotels in SF. The room was also very nice with a fantastic view. It is truly as nice a view as the pictures indicate. The only critique I had is that I heard a little too much outside noise and the bathtub/shower is simply ordinary and I would have liked something a little bigger. Are the rooms slightly nicer at the mandarin, yes, but really thats the only thing superior about the mandarin and at least for me the Hyatt was less than half the price. Overall it was a great stay, and probably the best value in SF in terms of what you get for the money. The rooms are well decorated and spacious, the service is exemplary and the view is simply killer.",21-Mar-14,5
"If you're in town, this is an ideal place to be staying, away from the tourist traps at Fisherman's wharf. Stayed for the night in transit before leaving for home. Was upgraded to a spacious suite, although the view was somewhat pathetic - overlooking roof-tops of other buildings, etc.You are always within stones throw of Union Square and public transport. The lounge on 32nd is surprisingly good and pleasant experience, with good choice of food and wine available",16-Mar-14,5
"Arrived via car hire after a day of flying, was met immediately by doorman with a cart, I had several bags. The new check-in area is in fitting with the new trend away from the sterile front desk, I liked it. Smooth check-in, upgraded to a nice suite, presented with Diamond amenity card showing various options as well as Club hours and service chart.The room remodel done here recently is great to look at, but the furniture is designer picked for looking at, not sitting on. The electric shutters are a nice touch, they could be darker and 1/2 inch wider to block light in my opinion. Rain shower is OK, I am not a fan of them, though. Bathroom sink is too large and too shallow, but looks cool.The Grand Club still occupies an amazing space on the 32nd floor, the views to die for, the food not so much. In San Francisco with all of the great restaurant choices, all I wanted at the club was a snack and a cocktail. The alcohol selection is basic, but adequate, and very fair honor bar priced. The food selection could be improved with very little effort or thought, Wednesday night was chicken wings for the hot dish, Thursday night tested the low end with mini turkey corn dogs, Really?I dislike that the restaurant has been moved from the top floor to the mezzanine. While the new bar is fine, with a nice drink selection and competitive prices, I really miss that view.So, overall, I think that the staff here were great at all levels! Parking is expensive, it is San Francisco, there are better places to eat than in the hotel, duh! It is in the best part of the city, easy to get to anywhere, great shopping, Chinatown, etc. San Francisco is a great city for uber cars!",16-Mar-14,5
"From our arrival until departure all the staff we met were welcoming, friendly and efficient.A recent refurb means all the rooms and public areas were clean, modern and efficient. The bar/restaurant offers excellent cocktailsThe location is excellent, right on Union Square and ideally placed for downtown shops and restaurants",16-Mar-14,5
"A 2 /12 would be more appropriate. We stayed here due to a conference. Three nights and fair to say nothing impressive or memorable. Nothing dramatically poor but loads of examples of contrast from hotels you stay at that excel. Night we checked in (family 4, 2 young children) when we asked for help with luggage placed on cart for us and left at front desk - did not offer to take up. (Cart we used actually sat over 24 hrs in hallway after we used - until we took down ourselves. Obviously small deal but indicative). Breakfast in room dining amongst flattest/plainest we've had at similar priced hotels ever. Directions to parking garage as well as once to leave hotel were seemingly incorrect. One occasion calling to front desk during daytime resulted in no answer at all. Almost on cue as finale my wife called down to ask for help with luggage and check out as I left to bring car around (with incorrect directions) and roughly 15 min later no bell hop yet. I parked and found head bell hop who realized no one had responded to our request and he went up himself. Kind of him but took 15-20 minutes for something generally in quality hotel is prompt (especially when not busy - as the Hyatt seemed to be at the time). Most interactions with staff were vanilla - no sense of anything extra or that folks were happy to be working there. As for for family or those hoping for a bit of pampering also not much to extol - no pool, no onsite spa/place for pedicure, etc.. Should note, however, the work out room was very good. The views are great, location desirable but the emperor has no clothes - only choose if no other option close by. ",13-Mar-14,2
"Had a great 4 nights at the grand Hyatt in San Francisco, it kicked off our west coast road-trip perfectly! We arrived in San Francisco late-evening on our first night and found the hotel fine, from the BART that comes from the airport- come out of station and a 10min direct walk up and you will see union square! First night we were tired from travelling from the UK so had some food and wine in the One Up restaurant which I would highly recommend- my partner is a chef and we both agreed they made the best crab cakes we have ever tasted!!! Little pieces of heaven!The hotel is perfectly located on Union square for shopping and catching the tram, it's around a half hour walk down to fishermans warf and the pier. We walked down through china town and then ended up just staying out all day/night as there is so much to do! Then we got the bus or a taxi back up to union square. Staff were extremely helpful and let me borrow a iPhone 5 charger as mine stopped working. Rooms are comfortable, clean and contemporary. Unfortunately we did not try the cocktail bar as we just stayed around the pier area after day trips out but would have loved to if we had more time. Would recommend and visit again- I loved San Francisco and the vibe of the place! We did the bike ride over the bridge and Alcatraz which were both amazing, we also went to Haight Ashbury which took us ages to get to, so in hindsight would have preferred to visit Golden Gate park or do the open top bus and have the easy option of hop- off hop- on there. ",13-Mar-14,5
"We stayed here at Christmas time while on vacation. In a nutshell, clean, good service, a bit noisey as we were on the street side, and convenient. Nice cafÃ©, better bar and close to everything. We would book here again!",11-Mar-14,5
"I have visited the Grand Hyatt 2 times in the past year . Once with just my wife and once with my wife and 3 kids and both vacations the Grand Hyatt was on the money ! Courteous, Clean, Informative, are just a few words to get started. The location is outstanding and views from the rooms were just awesome. Not far from all transportation (cable car , street cars , buses).Great food places all over and walking distance from Chinatown . We are very picky where we stay but this place is an all around HOME RUN !!!",11-Mar-14,5
"Stayed here for business/leisure (3 nights). We were above the 30th floor, with outstanding views of the bay, lovely suite. (Street noise was unfortunate). Room was in good shape & clean. Near Union Square shopping, which was a plus. Doormen very helpful and pleasant. OneUP cafe was nice. Had to come back for breakfast when recommended hotspot per Concierge had a line that took over 40 mins to barely move (let alone get in the door), so we ended up back to hotel just to eat something before we had to leave for airport. Waitstaff were very kind as we were now pressed for time. (No fault of the Concierge, really. Just very slow moving line ....)However, Conciege Desk in general was disappointing, and most recommendations fell flat. Asked for a trendy, fun place for Friday dinner and they suggested Michael Mina at St. Francis (Westin) Hotel. Just 2 blocks away, but DULL, DULL, DULL. Food good, but boring ambiance. There were only a few tables occupied, so not sure why I couldn't get the res time I requested. Would not be on my recommended list of dining spots.",10-Mar-14,3
"My husband & I traveled here for a long weekend on a business trip. We picked the Grand Hyatt for two reasons - the meeting was there & we are Hyatt GP members. We arrived late in the night and were warmly greeted. The location is simply amazing - we were within walking distance of so much! Our room was on the 15th floor, which had a nice view. The room (and whole hotel) was clean, spacious & modern. Our rooms fridge wasn't working and our shower head didn't work well but they immediately had someone come up to fix them promptly. Every morning, a NY Times was delivered to our room. The gym was nice, but will agree was not well ventilated. Parking was expensive, but we had done our homework a head of time & took a cab from the airport and booked an excursion to Napa instead of renting a car. Didn't try the restaurant since there was so much nearby. Would stay at again, especially with such a great location!",10-Mar-14,4
"I had a great experience during my stay and the customer service was exceptional. The bar has a wide selection of drinks and is very relaxing. The room was not as clean as I would've liked (there was hairs in the sink and toilet). I would stay here again because the customer service was awesome, but I hope the next time I stay my room is clean and hairless.",9-Mar-14,4
"I am a regular to San Francisco and am so happy to have discovered the Grand Hyatt. Not only are the staff from waiters to engineers superbly polite and helpful, but the facilities are really excellent. The restaurant food is tops. Try their tomato soup! Wow. The have a great swanky bar, a roomy conference facility and a wonderful 35th floor hotel gym with amazing city views. The rooms are to a high spec and very tech synced. Perfect for the urban or business traveller. And the location is simply perfect for Central San Fran. I will be back!",9-Mar-14,5
"As it is very close to Union Square, there isn't a better option in SF. Beds, cleaningness, rooms... everything up to it's cost and reputation.However, some small details to bear in mind:1. The concierges were rude when trying to approach them for indications and help.2. The Gym isn't well ventilated...3. Parking isn't easy in that sector.",9-Mar-14,4
The locations is great with tons of shopping and restaurants near by. Also close to various transportation and they had taxis lines up every time I needed one. Gorgeous lobby and meeting rooms on the 36th floor are impressive with majestic views. Service was very good. Rooms were nothing special but good and the automatic shades were kind of cool (once I figured them out). I would stay again. ,8-Mar-14,5
"Have stayed hear many times, mostly in the '99-'05 timeframe, stopped because the rooms and decor were both dated & worn. The remodel (not sure exactly when done) has brought this hotel, which is in a fantastic location, up to snuff. The bed was super comfortable with quality linens, god lighting and desk space, remote controlled blinds, nice big flat screen tv; even though I was only there one night, was very comforable. As everyone else has said, this is a great location for SF shopping, getting to BART or Cable cars to go everywhere. One note, the regency club hours are a bit minimal... wish it was open all day, like most international Grand Hyatt properties; also, I understand and appreciate the need to conserve water, but the flow from the showerhead was really weak and since it came out of a handheld, had to press nose to pipe to get under it to scrub all the shampoo out.",7-Mar-14,4
"As others have mentioned, this is an excellent location. I've stayed in the nearby Westin (great history, but dated) and Hyatt. A work colleague booked our meeting at this hotel, and I was really impressed.At just $185/night, the rooms were a bargain. The decor was modern and clean, with some amazing artwork in the lobby and bar. My room was spacious with a large, comfortable bed. My only minor complaint was that the water pressure could have been a little stronger, but it was fine.The bar was above average for a hotel, and the live music was a nice bonus. The drinks were a little pricey, but not unreasonable for SF.The highlight was the views from the meeting rooms on the 36th floor. Amazing 360 views.While my loyalties are normally with Starwood hotels, I'll definitely stay here next time I'm in the area.",6-Mar-14,5
"Nothing to have as a downside. Was not a bargain, but San Francisco hotels are pricey any way. A short walk from the BART stations Powell St and another one. Wondered whether it would be easier to get into town by taxi with big suitcases, but didn't need to worry about that. Pulling along big suitcases was no problem for the short walk from the station, and there's a lift from the station floor to the street on ground level, so you won't have to carry it, and the BART wasn't too crowded either. Room was nice an spacious enough, had a great view overlooking the Square, just as the reception staff promised with a great warm smile. Plenty of nice places to pick up breakfast at beside, and a lot of shops and restaurants open till late at night in a very safe looking neibourhood. One small regret is that I didn't get more of Ghirardelli's chocolate squares at a great bargain at Walgreens! Did the Big Bus hop-on-hop-off as well, that we started from the Square as well. China-town was just a few blocks away and just a short stroll.All in all, I think it was the 'niceness' of the staff that made this hotel a really nice place to stay. They really made me feel welcome without overdoing it or being too posh about it. They even have yoga mat rentals (for free I think, but don't quite remember), if you want to join the San Francisco locals with keeping fit.",6-Mar-14,5
"The best location in SF - Pros.- The property is located in Union Square- Remodel of the property just finished and it is stunning- The rooms are huge for SF standards- Every room will have a view- They have one of the best Grand Hyatt Lounges in Americas- Staff is outstanding at the front desk- Usually pretty solid in pricing and well worth its value- City parking garage across the street (Parked overnight on a Sat. for only $18!)- Gym is on the 28th floor (or something like that) and is huge!- Some of the best views from a hotel in SF (Maybe minus Fairmont SF and Westin)- Way better than any Marriott property in SFCons.- The bathroom sinks are useless and get water everywhere- Room shades are fun, but not practical - Elevators can be slow at times, but they have improved- It is an uphill walk slightly for a half a block to get back (but hey its SF)- Rooms can get a bit loud from outside- Front door staff is a bit lazyOverall, what a great property! The remodel is amazing, I was trying to get a suite but no dice as they were all sold out - but I saw the inside of one and just amazing. Upgrade to a Grand Hyatt Lounge access room - man that lounge is fantastic and has jaw dropping views.",5-Mar-14,5
I booked two rooms here for myself and a friend and my 23-year old daughter and her friend. They stayed two nights and we stayed three. I'm a big Hyatt fan so I always try to stay at a Hyatt because the service is always top notch and the locations are typically great. We checked in early Friday morning about 10 AM--much earlier than the 3 PM p.m. check in time. The staff placed us in rooms on the 26th and 27th floors. The view was fantastic! The only issue we had with the rooms with that the air conditioning was not sufficient. I had engineering come up twice and it was never really resolved although they did offer to move us to another room. This property has a great location right in the middle of Union Square--with tons of shopping and restaurants nearby and Starbucks right across the street. This is a perfect city for walking and we sure did a lot of it while we were there for four days. This Hyatt has a very nice wine bar and the package we booked included a buffet breakfast which was delicious. The staff is very accommodating and everyone's pretty friendly. This may be our new favorite hotel in San Francisco!,2-Mar-14,4
"I'm a local - living just North of 'the city' as locals like to call it and stayed in town one night because my business meetings would run long. Had been awhile since I had stayed here and they have redecorated. Uber modern - vessel sinks - pretty to look at, not so convenient if you need counter space to lay out your grooming supplies - ladies you know what I mean. But not a big deal. As all the previous travelers state - get a high room for two reasons: street noise (SF is a busy city and this is a very busy area) and views. Don't bring a car if you can help it. Why? For one thing this area is very pedestrian friendly with tons of restaurants/shopping w/i walking distance, secondly the traffic is a bear downtown and third it will cost you $62/night for valet and $41/night to self-park. The rooms are fine - nice touch is that all controls are right at your headboard - electrically controlled sun shade, lights, etc. Plenty of plug ins for electronics. Big picture windows. Union Square is just down the street, with a huge Macy's as well as many, many other shopping opportunities. Starbucks located in the hotel for your morning fix. Nice choice for staying in San Francisco.",28-Feb-14,5
"This hotel is right in the heart of Union Square. So if you go to San Francisco to go shopping, this is the perfect place. This hotel and the area is a high traffic tourist area. The lobby is new and modern. I stayed on either the female friendly or female only floor. It is a nice option if you are traveling alone. I was told that there were extra amenities for females. The extras were a nail polish remover pad and a facial cleansing cloth. The room was nice and clean, but a bit small for two people.",25-Feb-14,4
"I stayed here for 5 nights while in San Francisco on business. This hotel is in a great location for walking to the Financial District or around the immediate area for shopping or picking up one of the sightseeing tours that launch from Union Square.I checked in a bit early and asked if I could be placed in a high room since I read that street noise can be an issue. I felt the reservation desk representative went out of his way to get me in a great room even though a rather large convention seemed to be going on during my stay. I had to wait about an hour for my room but it was worth it. Room 2918 has a great view of the city facing Union Square. Street noise was still heard that high up but it wasnâ€™t bad and sort of added to the ambiance.Pros-The automatic shade was a really fancy feature that made me feel like I was a high roller. It did a great job of keeping out the unwanted sun in the early morning as well as helped keep the room cool when the sun was a little too intense.-The rooms have been remodeled in a modern style, very nice.-Flat screen TV-Built in TV guide, although it has a way to go. -Clean linens -Plenty of outlets at desk area and beside bed. -iPhone charger is available on the phone, although it is not a lightning connector.-The cleverly disguised refrigerator had nothing in it which was perfect for my needs. I just grabbed a few breakfast items and snacks at a local bodega to keep in there.-Concierge always very helpful and courteous Cons-I kept the temperature pretty low but I donâ€™t think it ever got as cool as the display read-While I didn't hear people in adjoining room, I did hear room service who was rather loud and housekeeping made lots of noise for hours even though there were only three rooms in the immediate area.-Not enough drawer space for clothing.-There isnâ€™t a lot of privacy in bathroom provided with a thin sliding door. -The shower head is a nice idea, the rain shower type, but it didn't telescope out far enough. I had to stand almost on the wall to wash shampoo out of my hair All in all, my visit was great. A few co-workers staying at a competing hotel chain said I definitely made the right choice by staying at the Grant Hyatt.",24-Feb-14,5
"We enjoyed everything about this hotel. It's a very close walk to China Town, it's a very nice walk down to Washington Square and Fisherman Wharf area. Union Square is just outside the doors which is very awesome. Great energy, great restaurants and amazing shopping all with-in a few minutes of anything you could want. The rooms were great, staff was very helpful. The gym was close to as good as you'll get at a hotel, great variety of equipment.",24-Feb-14,5
"We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is in a good location for shopping and is a short walk from the metro. Without traffic, it took us just over 20 minutes to get to/from the SFO Airport.The first night, we were in a corner room close to 2 other rooms. We heard music late at night from one of the rooms and then doors slamming early in the morning. We asked the front desk to switch our room for the 2nd night and they did so without any hassle. The 2nd night was very quiet. The room was comfortable and clean the bathroom was a good size.The hotel gym is well equipped and has nice views of the city through the clear glass walls.We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant, which offers a breakfast buffet. The food was okay; I would recommend exploring restaurants outside the hotel if you have time to do so.We were pleased with the service and location and would stay here again.",23-Feb-14,4
We just returned from a 4 night stay here with 2 young kids. The room was very well appointed but the two double beds were VERY small especially for adults. You'd really need to get interconnecting rooms with older kids. The hotel staff were accommodating and moved us 3 times until we settled for a room with one king bed and a roll away. We weren't allowed to have 2 roll aways which meant our youngest child had to share the king bed with us! Not ideal but still more spacious than 2 cramped double beds. Beds were comfortable though. The room was very clean but a little dusty. This could be due to the dark wood furniture attracting dust but even so it detracted from the otherwise clean feeling. We could hear guests in the other rooms as I'm sure they could hear us! Great bay view on the 27th floor but even this high up the street noise was significant. We enjoyed the cocktails in the bar and very tasty bar snacks. Very friendly and attentive staff here. Would definitely stay here again were it not for the small double beds. ,22-Feb-14,4
"Totally love this hotel.It is clean, comfortable, in a convenient location and has lovely staff! I arrived early and they had allowed me an early check in. Room was big, well appointed and well maintained - Grand Hyatt standards. It may not be the best Hyatt property I've stayed in but good enough. Service standards were good, staff were efficient, pleasant and always ready to lend a hand.There is a water dispenser then comes in handy when you run out of drinking water at every level. Quite thoughtful of the hotel in my opinion.I would stay here again when I visit San Fran!",21-Feb-14,5
"My wife and 8 year old daughter spent Valentine weekend at the Grand Hyatt and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location near Union Square is very central to great shopping. Service was friendly and efficient. The room was roomy, comfortable with a nice bay view. Having a fridge and a microwave was convenient. We were able to check in early and they even provided a welcome gift of cupcakes and juice. The only improvement I'd suggest is to darken the glass bathroom door, as its very bright at night when others are still asleep. We would stay here again and recommend this hotel without any hesitation.",18-Feb-14,5
"I loved the Grand Hyatt. I stayed there for 4 nights and wished I could have stayed longer. I called to ask for an early check in and spoke to Zack. He took my number and let me know when the room was ready. I was able to check in at 11:30. When I got to the hotel, Nakita checked me in. She was so friendly and offered to give me a late checkout which I really appreciated. A very nice bellman took me to my room which was on a high floor but did not have an exceptional view. I was told that was the only king available at the time and they would change the room the next day. However, when I returned from a bit of sightseeing, Steve was at the front desk and he found a room for me on the 27th floor overlooking Union Square. I loved the view. I sat in front of the window lots of times and just enjoyed the city. The hotel has these cool motorized shades that you can raise and lower from a switch at bedside. That was so great because as soon as I wake up I like to see what the weather is like outside.Steve and Jessica who are both front desk managers were also so helpful. I really felt that I was being so well taken care of by everyone at the hotel. Thanks so much to all of you.The only cons: I wish they had grab bars in the bathtub. I was told that all rooms have adjoining doors. I guess there isn't anything that can be done about it. For the first 3 nights of my stay, I never heard anyone in the adjoining room. However, the last night and morning I could hear a woman talking in the room next door. It wasn't a problem. It just felt somewhat odd.",13-Feb-14,5
"The hotel has recently been completely renovated and is very modern. Our room had automatic blackout shade that you could control from the bed which was super nice in the morning. The room was pretty spacious and had a separate vanity area that my wife used to put on makeup. The hotel is across the street from Union Square, tons of high end shopping and two cable car stops. We also ordered room service twice during our stay and the food was quick and good, however pretty expensive. Really couldn't have been happier.",12-Feb-14,5
"Really nice hotel. Stayed for business, thought it had a high end business feel. But would like it for leisure as well. Large and active but attentive service. Grand Hyatt knows how to make you feel special, like you are the only guest staying at the hotel. Didn't have full meal but they have a mini counter to grab a coffee and snacks. Cappuccino was watered down but girls serving were lovely. Would definitely stay again. ",11-Feb-14,4
"Great location, great staff, great room. Consider reserving a room on floor 20 or higher with a view of the bay. Health Club on 35th floor has fantastic views. If I discuss the imperfections of my visit I would be embarrassed for nitpicking. I look forward to visiting again.",9-Feb-14,5
"Nice hotel, right on Union Square by the Stockton St. Tunnel. Their Bay view rooms are very nice. This is a place you can just sit in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows and watch the city and bay. One block from a cable car stop and a short pleasant walk to convention center, china town and little Italy. I would stay there again, especially if I can manage to get one of those bay view rooms again. Of all the very helpful concierge desk personnel, John really deserves a special mention for taking care of me, when the person at the front desk was not at all helpful. He restored my faith in Hyatt hospitality. My flights to Atlanta were cancelled, so I needed to stay an extra night. Even though they had my room still available the person at the front desk wanted double my room rate and when I declined the price increase, sent me to the concierge to find me a cheaper alternative, who then was able to extend my stay at the Hyatt for one more night for the same rate. ",9-Feb-14,5
"This Hyatt has undergone some great renovations, and I enjoy staying here. I am always greeted and treated with respect when I check in. The public areas have a hip, city vibe. Beds are comfortable and linen is crisp. Lighting is well designed in the bathrooms. Interactions I had with staff members were always positive and polite.On the slightly critical side, It appeared to me, having stayed here a few times, that there are longterm tenants on each floor (I am not sure if this is correct, but the food smell coming from one of these rooms was a little off-putting). Water pressure is a little low but the shower is still good, and while the sinks are beautiful to look at, the water takes a while to drain, which I always hate when I am brushing my teeth (I don't need to go into any more detail!)  As a Hyatt Platinum member I love the upgrade perk, especially when it entails a high room looking over Union Square! The location is obviously superb, and there is great parking just across the road for $35.00 a night.",8-Feb-14,4
"This is a modern hotel located a block from Union Square. The staff were helpful and friendly! Our room was very comfortable and had the view of the Bay, which was nice. The front desk let us see the top floor and try the buffet for free. Our 2 night stay just happened to coincide with the Bat Kid event and we got to meet the Batman teenager - very cool! I would definitely stay here again!",8-Feb-14,5
"We chose this hotel because we wanted to stay at a Grand Hyatt and it had of view of the city in San Francisco. I guess you can say we were disappointed. Me and my husband don't think there is really anything grand about it. Check In was interesting. It seemed to us that this hotel is trying too hard to reinvent the wheel. The check in area felt like you were waiting to speak to a banker. There were tables scattered around the check in area with laptops and a few people to check you in. It seemed disorganized and there really wasn't a way to tell who was next in line. In fact we were waiting there before another couple and they were helped first. The check in person was very friendly. We really don't like when they try to be your friend and in this case the person was. He asked us a billion questions that we didn't feel like answering. All we wanted to do was to be checked in and go to our room. My husbands patients were wearing thin after an 8 hour drive.The Valet people were awesome. They were very helpful with your car, luggage, upon arrival and when we left. Parking is expensive whether you park it yourself or do valet. Our room had a nice view. The room was small and it was an adjoining room. I am learning that I need to specify no adjoining room in future reservations at any hotel. Our neighbors were noisy and we really didn't appreciate feeling like we were in their conversations. Again the room was small, it was very clean. Again it seemed like they were trying too hard to be modern. It didn't feel like a Grand hotel. The furnishing were cheap, for example the end table drawers were hard to open and felt like they were going to fall apart. The room as well as the bathroom was very modern. The bed was comfortable, nothing special.We added a meal plan to our reservation for breakfast and it wasn't good. The meal plan only includes the buffet. The eggs tasted fake and they were even able to mess up bread for toast. My husband said Wonder Bread would have been better to make toast with. He didn't even finish a quarter of his toast because of the taste. The juice was brought out in little tiny cups like they were giving you a sample but in fact it was the actual size. The staff was very helpful and nice.We probably won't be staying here anytime soon.",6-Feb-14,3
"Location at Union Square is unbeatable. Just two to three blocks from main shopping centres; 5 mins walk to Chinatown; 15 mins walk to Japan Center. Nice lobby with (gas) fireplaces and squashy sofas. Restaurant on Mezzanine floor excellent (service and food unpeccable). The room, however, was not above standard; the bathroom cold and cheap-looking. Shower had very weak pressure; the (old, burned an battered) ironing plank was leaning against a wall in the bathroom because too big for the tiny closet.Staff at front desk was very freindly and helpful. Housekeeping staff (I met one male member of that team who delivered shower gel they had forgotten to stock up again) was grumpy and rude.Overall this hotel could make a much better impression, if they would invest just a few bucks for a face lift of the bathroom. Otherwise it's OK.",6-Feb-14,3
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for four nights of our Honeymoon in late November 2013. From the moment we arrived after a long, long flight from Europe we were made feel at home and welcome by the friendliness, courteousness and professionalism of the staff at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco.Our room was spacious, had a fantastic view of the city and was beautifully furnished. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the coffee maker with take away cups in our room was a nice touch, especially when you have an early start. We booked some tours and day trips through Joanna the hotel concierge and she was fantastic. She went out of her way to get us a last minute spot on a city day trip which included Muir Woods and Suasalito. She also booked us on a trip to Yosemite. She was very professional and discrete whilst making bookings with our credit card details over the phone. At OneUp restaurant we had the breakfast buffet which was very good with lots of choice. With very early starts to go sightseeing we were set up for the morning with the great breakfast they provided.I have already recommended the Grand Hyatt San Francisco to family and friends and will continue to do so. The hotel is in a fantastic location, right on Union Square with many many great shops. Also we were able to walk to city sights including Fishermans Wharf and to Coit Tower. We would like to Thank the staff of the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for making the first leg of our honeymoon memorable and special. I feel quite proud of myself for choosing to stay here. We loved San Francisco and cannot wait to return. When we do we will definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco on Union Square.",2-Feb-14,5
"The Grand Hyatt SF is a fantastic hotel! The Staff are great, the location is awesome and the rooms are amazing.When I arrived at my room, I was greeted with my name displayed on a screen and great music playing, I felt like a celebrity! The big was super comfortable and the view was great (I was on the 17th floor), I could see all the way to the water.The location is perfect. You're right beside shopping and restaurants at Union Square, which is a great area and everything is within walking distance. China Town is a 10 minutes walk and Fisherman's Wharf maybe 25.I loved this hotel and would book again. I found the rates very reasonable for the quality of service and location.",31-Jan-14,5
"The place has been recently remodeled and is at a great location. Well greeted at the door, friendly staff, clean room, comfortable beds. The place is nice and quite, other then hearing an occasional trumpet playing outside in the streets. Other then hearing a door close every once in a while you can hear foot steps or people in the other rooms. The bathroom area is nice, the showers are fine, don't need to use the hand held like other reviewers mentioned. It adjust just fine with good water pressure and heats up fast. Overall great experience, the only thing was that the TV wasn't working bur I wasn't there to watch TV. But is did figure out the cable in the back was just loose. I really liked the electronically adjustable shade for the large door/window...",30-Jan-14,5
"This hotel has a great location right above Union Square - we had a room with a view over the Square. The rooms have been redone in a contemporary style and are comfortable and very light. Bathroom was a bit small with a both/shower combination but the wardrobe had an ironing board and iron in it as well as a blanket and extra pillow.One minor issue is the fact that information about the hotel is only available on the TV screen - there is no information folder or room menu. I think that most people still like to be able to look at a hard copy for information/services rather that a TV screen.Other issue was the amenities in bathroom - if you want as shower cap or mouthwash or cotton buds you have to ring and ask for them. This is a bit minimalist, in my view, for a Park Hyatt.Staff are efficient and our room was cleaned promptly each day. Good gym on the 35th floor but can be a bit crowded at peak times. We were here for six nights and had problems with noisy guests in an adjoining room on one night - and no sleep between 2am and 3am. We had to call and complain twice. Security attended both times but the guests ignored the first warning. While this is not the fault of the hotel, it was a problem and possibly could have dealt with more effectively when we first complained.However, all in all, this is a good base in the Union Square area and we would recommend the hotel.",27-Jan-14,4
"This hotel was remodeled last year. The rooms and lobby are well appointed. It's in a great location. Easy walking to the best shopping and the wonderful ferry market. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. That being said, I'm not sure i'd stay here again. I don't like handheld shower heads and the hotel has the most limited tv stations I've ever encountered, except for maybe Russia. You also have to navigate the tv using a mouse. I didn't like it enough that I may not stay here on a return visit. ",26-Jan-14,3
"After reading some reviews I was concern about some issues like check in, people not being friendly or helpful. However, this has been one of the best hotels I have been lately. Perfect location, great views from all rooms and the staff, all of them very extremely friendly, courteous, kind. Betsy did the check in for us in one minute, with a smile and gave us the rooms we requested. Then I wanted to do some changes in my bill and Olivia helped me in seconds! And the best, friendly person ever was Susan at the concierge desk. She booked some restaurants for us, transport to the airport, the big Bus hop on hop off tour, and was always eager to help! Doormen always opened the door with a smile, a nice word, very friendly!Loved the room, the view, the fact that there was a coffee making machine in the room, but best of all was the staff. This was our first time in San Francisco and this hotel made our stay a wonderful one. Will definetly return to this hotel",26-Jan-14,5
"It's been a little over a year since I stayed here. It was under renovation the last time, and I expected a nicely redone hotel this time. It is, to an extent, but they made one fatal error that is bound to cost them guests. They closed the restaurant/bar with one of the best views in SF and moved it to the mezzanine where it is now dark and claustrophobic. Apparently, they thought they'd make more money using the space for meetings. What a shame. They have denied their loyal guests (many who stay here just for that view) one of the main reasons for picking this hotel. I am a Hyatt Platinum member, but the next time I'm in SF, I may have to look for a hotel with a real view.",26-Jan-14,3
"This is the second time I have stayed at this property and the first time I have splurged on an Executive Suite. This accommodation is well worth the extra money foremost because of the extra space with a separate bedroom and the bonus of a powder room off the living room area for your guests to use. I find the normal guest rooms on the smallish side and with an odd layout. The club level lounge has stunning views and has a more than ample amount of amenities.The staff at the hotel was very helpful and on top of things. This is especially true of the door staff and the valets. The front desk and room service staff were also prompt and helpful.The only minor complaint I have regarding this hotel is that they do not stock Diet Sierra Mist which every other US Hyatt that I have stayed in carries. This may seem like a small point, however as a diabetic I really appreciate that Hyatt carries a non cola beverage that can also be used as a mixer.I plan on staying at this property again in the future.",25-Jan-14,4
"Pros:- Great location, close to Market Street, Financial District, Chinatown, etc.- Renovated rooms (we stayed in an executive suite, and the setup was pretty good)- Responsive GM team (we had requested an upgrade before checking in, and they generously accommodated us)Cons:- Disconnect between their Twitter team and the rest of the staff (we had asked if we could get an early check-in, which was confirmed, but ended up not happening, causing me to miss an important client call) -- the front desk person didn't even know they had a Twitter team- Doormen were inconsistent in holding the door for guests- Shower door opens outward, which is inane, and makes it pretty much impossible to get your towel without getting the bathroom floor wetI would've given this hotel a better rating if not for the check-in issue, but I would certainly recommend this to others who are looking for a well-located and well-furnished hotel.",24-Jan-14,3
"Our hotel stay here was amazing. The rooms are spacious and quiet, and the bed was extremely comfortable - I slept great. The staff were very nice and friendly and were eager to help us in selecting a place to eat nearby.The hotel's location is perfect if you're doing business in the city, and you're within walking distance of several great places to shop and amazing restaurants. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was delicious. Coupled with the Starbucks across the street, it made it easy to get going in the morning.My room was on the 29th floor and the view from up there was amazing, and the upper floors have restricted quiet hours, which made for a great night's sleep.Overall our experience here was great and if I'm ever back in San Francisco, I will definitely stay here again.",24-Jan-14,5
"Fantastic location-- perfect for a short walk to the Moscone Center and right across the street from a Starbucks (bonus). The doormen and valets were extremely helpful and polite. Love them.I really liked staying here on business, but noticed there were some quirks that made things a bit inconvenient for doing work. There were no outlets on the walls... only on the side of the TV and in the bathroom. Very tough if you use your phone as your alarm clock or need to charge multiple items (laptop, phone, iPad, etc). Also, the lighting was strangely laid out, so I couldn't quite get enough light wherever I was in the room. Seems petty, I know, but was annoying for the business traveler in me.I LOVED the travel amenities (shampoo, lotion, etc) -- better quality than most places I stay. Room service was great and on-time, but like so many hotels, extremely overpriced for the quality.",23-Jan-14,4
Location is great! Check in was super easy and wonderful customer service. Very clean rooms and on the big side for San Francisco. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. The only negative is the $60 parking which is outrageous! Find a parking garage if you can.,22-Jan-14,4
"This Grand Hyatt has been totally redone.From the front office with the most courteous staff to the room service staff that is doing everything to please (with a smile)A great New bar, with a quality restaurant, ( very unusual for a hotel)On my next to SFO , this willBe the hotel of my choice.",18-Jan-14,5
"Location I think is the best in San Francisco, directly at Union Square. After the recommandation the rooms are very modern and clean. Negative: small restaurant for the breakfast and in peak hours you have to wait",18-Jan-14,4
"Wanted a nice place for a quick get out of town stay. Spent lots of time on Yelp looking and finally decided on the Grand Hyatt. Check in was smooth and easy. We asked for a room with a water view higher up and got a great one on the 25th floor with floor to ceiling windows and a partial view of Alcatraz!The bed, pillows, dÃ©cor, tv, and most everything in the room was 5 star.What makes my review only a 4 star is only for the fact that you can hear your neighbors if there wasn't any source of noise in our room. But luckly they checked out after the first morning.But the concierge desk made the getaway really amazing! Everyone one of the staff was very professional and eager to help. They gave maps with detailed instructions/directions and recommendations to whatever we asked for.So a big 5 star for the Concierge Desk! They made things easy for a slightly OCD person like me ;-) Location was really great, couldn't get much closer to Union Square and there was a starbucks across the street.All in all a great value for the what you get. I'd be very happy to come back again.Sincerely, David D.",17-Jan-14,4
I stayed here for two nights when travelling to Honolulu. This hotel is great cause of its location and service. I recieved top service. Everyone at the checkin was friendly and 100% there to make my stay great. I had the suite at the 29th floor wich had spectacular view over the city of SF. The Grand Club was also top notch with food and beverage. I sat there alot cause of the nice view of the city. I have no complaints about this hotel at all! I think they treat their platinum/diamond members very good here and therefor i will stay here next time again. I really enjoyed it!,13-Jan-14,4
"Grand Hyatt is located in Union Square. There are plenty of shopping nearby. Chinatown is a few blocks away. Friendly and smooth check-in. Modern type reception, which was very welcoming. The lobby is on the smaller side but I liked the design. The rooms are nice. The color scheme are very earthy and furniture is Jetson like. Comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. The bathroom is adequate, however the pressure in the shower was poor. Breakfast was great and service during breakfast was stellar.",12-Jan-14,3
"I'm a frequent traveler in luxury hotels. Hotel get 4 stars, restaurant 2 stars - hence 3 stars in total. Stayed here over the weekend. Location is absolutely great - walking distance to everything. Friendly staff and good clean room with a very comfortable bed. Lived in 1001 - some noise from the elevator and ice machine. Water in the shower running slow - annoying. Only one small restaurant at the hotel. Ordered room service twice - very boring food with no taste. Breakfast the same. But again: Staff is very friendly. OK bar if you want to get a beer, but rather small for a hotel this size.",12-Jan-14,3
"We stayed at this hotel by Union Square for eight nights over Christmas. The hotel is located perfectly in the midst of all the shops, so the location is perfect for shoppers who need to drop off their shopping bags several times during the day.The hotel itself is very clean, the bed is quite comfortable, love the numerous pillows, airconditioning is great. We also had an air purifier in the room. Wifi was not bad and it was free. I especially liked the anti-slip mat in the bathtub. This mat, plus the soap dish by the sink, were much appreciated. I don't see these often in hotels, but they are so useful and makes a big difference for safety (the anti-slip mat) and neatness (the soap dish).Service staff were also very polite and helpful, from the front desk, the concierge, valets, cleaners... no complaints! The lobby is a bit small, however, and there are not many seats for sitting/waiting. It can be a long wait at the elevators. It was a very busy hotel when we were there but once you are in the privacy of your room, it is very relaxing.Overall, an excellent pick. I would recommend the hotel and I would stay there again.",9-Jan-14,5
"Stayed overnight, had first-rate the following morning, quiet rooms, good sleep. First night picked up relative coming in from over-seas, so 2 rooms worked best for us. Breakfast in a.m. first-rate in beautiful setting on Mezzanine floor.All service was tops, the location? The absolute BEST.",9-Jan-14,5
"We were planning a last minute family trip to SF and I had to find a hotel that was not only in a convenient location but that also had the the amenities we needed for our toddler. After doing some research online and seeing that there weren't very many choices for hotels with kitchenettes, I found that the Grand Hyatt SF offered refrigerators (not many hotels do these days), connecting rooms and a microwave upon request. Plus, the bathroom sink was large enough for me to wash my baby's bottles!! All requests (microwave, extra towels, bellman, etc) were fulfilled at lightning speed. The hotel was so clean and modern. I loved having the outlet right on the dresser so that I could charge my phone. The remote controlled shade was awesome as was the reading lights attached to the headboard!! My only complaint would be that the drawers were very small but since our trip was short (2 nights), we didn't really bother to unpack. The location was ideal - right smack in the middle of Union Square and so convenient to everything. There is a Starbucks right across the street (and another one around the corner) so our morning coffee runs were quick and convenient. It was nice to be able to grab a cup of coffee and some breakfast while taking the baby for a quick stroll. Everyone from the valet guys, the check-in staff, the bellmen, etc. was very nice and polite. My husband kept mentioning that the hotel rate was so good for such an amazing hotel. Even though we were on the 14th floor, we could still hear the hustle and bustle of the streets below...that's what we get for staying in the city! If we wanted quiet, we would have stayed at a B&B in the country. But that did not deter us from getting a good night's rest. The beds were very comfortable. I normally do not sleep well in hotels on the first night but had absolutely no problem. That says a lot! Oh and our friends (who traveled with us but stayed on a different floor) brought their dog because the hotel is pet-friendly! What a bonus! We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",7-Jan-14,5
"We stayed for four nights in November and was very pleased with the location. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we went to do some shopping nearby at Walgreens. After returning approximately one hour later, it still wasn't ready. I suggested they comp us dinner since it was way past check in time while we waited for our room. How quickly they found another room on a higher floor...which turned out to be a blessing because we ended up on the 29th floor with an awesome bay view!! The beds are very comfy. We felt very safe inside this hotel. I called security the first night due to loud people in the room next to us. Security arrived almost immediately and took care of the problem. The concierge was so helpful to us during our stay. I can't tell you how thankful I am that Angela helped me with something that needed safely secured for my flight home. She went out of her way to help me and smiled the entire time. Many fast food places nearby for quick meals. Powell St. one block over where you can catch the trolley to other tourist attractions. If you decide to buy any tours then I would suggest The Great Pacific Tour Co. They pick you up at the hotel in the smaller vans and start the tour almost immediately. We had to take the wine tour on a big bus with another co. and was not happy that we were taken to another location and transferred to another bus. We knew this was going to happen but the GOOD tour co. was already booked. I suggest booking ahead to get them as we did on one of the tours and had no problems. The area around the hotel itself is very busy and noisy. Be aware that you can hear this in the hotel rooms so don't expect it to be without noise. I would stay again in this hotel despite the street noise!!",7-Jan-14,4
"We were in San Francisco to get married in early December 2013, and I think this was a great choice for our hotel. It was close to everything (not just Union Square, but also Chinatown and great restaurants). We're walkers, so honestly it was close to everything for us. Cabs were ALWAYS outside, so even on those occasions we didn't walk, transportation was effortless. The front-desk staff was average to good, but the restaurant staff was excellent. They were chatty in a friendly way, were curious about the brand of teabag I brought with me (yes, I'm one of THOSE people), and remembered us each day. And the breakfast and bar menu were fantastic. You won't be disappointed. Even the yogurt was fabulous.My only negatives were the televisions placed all over the hotel lobby and restaurant blasting Fox News. It seemed a very odd choice in such a liberal city, and I did not need to see it every time I walked out of the elevator. And the front desk staff could've been slightly more friendly. They were a little too business-like for my preference.",6-Jan-14,4
"Stayed here 20 years ago, returned this past week, and it's still a terrific hotel. I got a great rate over New Years, including the breakfast package (a very nice buffet, the fruit was delicious, though the wait staff a bit obsequious). Was in a room that had some slight residual elevator noise the first night, and they were very accommodating to me, moving me to a 22nd floor room overlooking Union Square.Rooms were clean and very quiet, though if you face Union Square, sometimes you can get some late evening noise (music for the skaters; the obnoxious beeping from a lift moving up/down as they were removing decorations off Macy's windows across the street), but it was only one night, and done by midnight. A southern and eastern facing room yields the best views, and if you choose to utilize their fitness center (which has a good variety of equipment and is very well-maintained), you won't be disappointed with that view, either!",6-Jan-14,5
Great location in Union Square - close to lots of shopping and the trolley. We stayed on floor 29 and overlooked the ice skating rink. The elevators were fast so I would recommend a high floor. The lobby was always packed but using the back doors made it easily accessible. The rooms were very clean and modern. The lobby could use an updated in furniture. Lovely view. Downtown hotels are expensive but this was almost worth the extra money for the ease of location - don't bring your own car - nightly parking is too expensive in the city. Use the trolley; limo; or taxi. PS - No pool.,5-Jan-14,5
"Have not got shares in Hyatt group, but my experience with them is their excellent customer service and this hotel did not disappoint. This was a 50th birthday treat and I had a brilliant room with great city views. The room was a great size, excellent staff and always being helpful with a smile. The beds were really comfortable, an issue for me as I hate hard beds, a good sized flat screen television. Will definitely stay again if I am in San Francisco again",5-Jan-14,5
"My wife, 2 children and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 4 nights over the New Year period in a Suite and attaching king bedroom.The hotel did not come across as the typical Grand Hyatt. We have potentially spent up to $ 500,000.00 staying at Grand Hyatt`s, Park Hyatt`s and Andaz hotels around the world and felt a little let down at this hotel. We never contemplate staying at any other Hotel brand however after this stay will consider other brands similar to The Four Seasons.After breakfast on the second morning we were locked out of our suite / and attached room. We went down to the front reception and obtained new keys as this we thought was the problem. After trying the new keys we still could not access the rooms. We went back down to reception to be told that the keys are fine it was our credit card that had insufficient funds to pay for the rooms. We then made several frantic phone calls to try and get to the bottom of the issue knowing that there were sufficient funds on the credit card. We were then advised by our credit card provider that the issue is not with our card it was in fact the Grand Hyatt who was entering the incorrect expiry date. We took this up with the assistant manager Zac and he finally advised that it was their fault and simply said I hope you enjoy the remainder of your day. Due to this hiccup we managed to miss our tour on this day. Normally in a situation like this the Grand Hyatt brand would have apologised unconditionally and sent a bottle of wine to our room as a peace offering. It was clearly their mistake that ruined our day and made us miss the tour. Not good enough Hyatt ! It would appear the Asian Hyatt`s have far superior customer service. The TV in the main bedroom of the Suite did not work so we then had to phone twice to have it serviced. It still did not work so therefore I demanded another TV on the following day therefore meaning we had no working TV in the suite bedroom for almost 48 hours. There was no apology from management or any refund mentioned. Again not good enough Hyatt. In general we found the majority of the staff to be impersonal and overly stand - offish.The location is good however not ON Union Square.The hotel was obviously another hotel in its past life and the Grand Hyatt have tried to make it there own however with small pokey doorway entrances, noisy lifts in the middle of the night, impersonal staff, it falls short. Sad to say but on our return trip we will definitely consider the Four Seasons and if up to scratch will then forward our business to them - worldwide.madijack",5-Jan-14,2
"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for our honeymoon for 6 nights. Check in was great. A warm welcome from one of the staff who informed us we had a complimentary upgrade to a room with a fantastic view of the city and Alcatraz!The room was lovely with a large flat screen tv, safe, electronic blinds. Complimentary coffee was also a bonus.We ordered room service once and the food was okay. We ate at the restaurant One Up and the food was great. Excellent service from the waiter too and barman!I used the 24 hour gym a few times. The equipment was all modern with fantastic views of the city.We really loved this hotel. It is modern. In a great location in Union Square.Here are the negatives and reason for marking down our review-Upon checking out we had a look at our bill onscreen which showed $200+ for room upgrade and room service. We just thought there was an error for the upgrade charge so thought nothing of it.When we went to the desk to check out it was a totally different experience than checking in. No greeting from the guy at the desk. No 'how was your stay' or anything like that. We questioned the bill to which he replied saying there wasn't anything showing on the system to say that we've received a complimentary upgrade. He did mention there was a note on the system saying they would send up a gift to celebrate our honeymoon though (we didn't receive this 'gift') After a brief debate about the bill he had a word with his manager who then agreed to take the charge off the bill and then they would be in touch if there need to question the bill. After that no goodbye or hope you enjoyed your stay. Nothing. Maybe this guy didn't want to be in work on New Years Day I don't know, but we can say that sadly our impressions of the hotel were mixed and the negative was down to one staff member.",5-Jan-14,3
"The location was fantastic, close to everything. Our room featured a floor to ceiling window, which would have been great if we were higher floor and were able to see more than only the hotel closest to us! The door men were friendly, the front desk staff didn't seen too happy or very welcoming. My biggest issue was the carpet in our room, it was dirty and had visible stains.",4-Jan-14,4
"The hotel is right in union square in san francisco. We stayed in mid December and it was very festive at the hotel and the surrounding area. We had a room with a nice view of the city. The staff was very friendly and efficient. My kids ordered room service; the room service menu is very limited but the delivery time was decent.The room was smaller, but given we are in the heart of San Francisco, it is to be expected. The room was modern and the bathroom was larger and well stocked. The Hyatt bed is always comfortable.We had the breakfast buffet. The selection at the buffet was very limited. The staff was really terrific.I liked this hotel better than the Westin in Union Square where we had previously stayed around Christmas time. Will return to this Grand Hyatt next time we are in SF for Christmas festivities.",4-Jan-14,4
"Checking in was very easy with nice employee. Chain hotel feeling though. Rooms ok for the deal we got for family with three children. Nice plus to get an included breakfast buffet - lovely and healthy choices! Rooms have been renovated but on beige/brown sad side. Very slim doors at bathroom and hallway doors. No in room bar. Tiny fridge though and coffee maker. Hard to find out how lights work! Good tv, wifi reception so so.. Lots of noise in the AM from cleaning ladies in adjacent rooms as early as 7am. Good view on city and bay from bay side though (higher floors). Down side: a bit chain like and room cleaning down to minimum (maybe because we were a family?) not even refill of soaps/ shampoos etc.!!! No cleaning of coffee maker holder, some days not even vacuum of room... People in this country have a strange tendency to think that families don't care about cleanness and organized rooms!!! How strange.. they usually care more than others. Still, good compromise for 2 connecting rooms and very central too. ",3-Jan-14,4
"This past fall with stayed at the Grand Hyatt Kauai and it definitely sets the standard of grand. I do not believe that I am making an unfair comparison in stating that the SF Hyatt falls well below this benchmark. My wife, daughter and I typically make it a point to stay at a hotel on Union Square during the holidays to bask in the beauty of all that is great about SF this time of year. Last year we stayed at the Westin St. Francis which was nice. This year we decided to give the Hyatt a chance.When we arrived we had to double park, this is downtown SF and is to be expected. After securing someone to assist with the bags, I mentioned that there were several coats in the rear driver's side where I had left the vehicle's door open. After acknowledging my request, he briefly engaged another guest and then began wheeling the baggage cart to the door. I pointed out he had forgotten the coats (and my car door was still open to traffic). He realized his err and went to pick up the remainder of our luggage. This would not be that big a deal but for our subsequent experience. Check-in was easy and to the GHSF's credit they have a modernized set-up where the staff mingles with guests checking in at a number of tables and utilizes iPads for check in. We had a nice room on the 23rd floor overlooking a corner of Union Square and facing the Sir Francis Drake. One criticism about the room, however, they do not stock it at all period. Now many hotels have gone away with honor bars but it would be nice to at least have a little bottled water, even if we were charged for it. Instead, everything had to be ordered via room service or an on floor vending machine.Room service was another unfortunate let down. As we had tickets to take my 5 year old to see the Nutcracker Ballet, we decided to order room service to make it in time for the show which started at 7 pm. The GHSF has an online ordering system for room service which allows you to make your selections via your television. It will even allow you to set a time for delivery of your order. We placed an order at 3:30 and elected 5 pm for delivery. My daughter had been asleep for about 20 minutes when we received a knock in the door ""room service"". As it was only about 4 pm, I opened the door and informed the server that the time of delivery was 5 pm. Fortunately my daughter slept through the interruption. The server returned at 5 pm and the quesadillas we had ordered were terrible. Flavorless, flour tortillas folded in half. I don't expect a whole lot from room service, but again this is a Grand Hyatt.Waiting for a taxi to take us to the Nutcracker was another adventure. And thought it is really hard to get taxis this time of year in downtown SF, it was if there was no system in place to secure them. It was if it was the first time the bell hops had dealt with the problem. And it almost appeared as though cabs were avoiding the GHSF for some reason.Finally, after checking out of our rooms around 11 am, we requested the bell desk to hold our bags so we could grab breakfast and do a little shopping. I was handed 5 claim checks for each of our bags. When we returned to the hotel, valet brought around my car and I requested our bags. After 15-20 minutes of waiting a bell hop came out with 2 of out bags. He reentered the hotel and after 10 minutes came out and asked what the remaining bags looked like. I can only imagine what the storage area must have looked like.All in all we did have an enjoyable stay, we only wish the GHSF could have done a much better job to make it better.",3-Jan-14,3
"On arrival we had to look for someone to help us with our bags, which was a disappointing start. The check-in was smooth and our request for adjoining rooms was accommodated, but at the cost of a room with a view, so sadly we had a view of other buildings and we looked down onto the roof of UGG. The rooms were clean modern and comfortable and the beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were also clean and had good amenities, but were quite small. We found the service throughout the hotel quite cold and impersonal, and room service took ages. One Up bar/lounge is a great place to unwind and relax with a drink and a snack after a long day. The hotel's major advantage is it's proximity to all the shopping, dining and attractions of Union square and we happened to be there during the weekend of Santa Con...the Santa convention. We were treated to thousands of Santas of all shapes sizes, styles and parental guidance ratings ;-)",3-Jan-14,4
"The view was very nice, is a very big property in the very heart of San Francisco so easy to walk to the best places , the room very comfortable and big , the bar area super we expended new year was super busy but we really enjoy.The concierge very nice and helpful .",3-Jan-14,5
"Positive: -modern-awesome bathroom-great view-location (starbucks across road)-fancy and sophisticatedNegatIve: -the only negative I have is that if you have a room up high, you can feel and hear earth tremors, not pleasant for those who are nervous",2-Jan-14,5
"We stayed 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. We paid for a city view with an AAA discount. At check in we were able to get a corner room - a tad larger than a regular room because we had a roll away to accommodate. We had room 2308. Our view was amazing!! Floor to ceiling windows with a shade controller on both sides of the King sized bed. The hotel is located a short short block from Union Square. Great location right by China Town, terrific shopping and restaurants. You'll need to drive or take transportation to Pier 39 but we actually walked back through Ghiradelli Square, Lombard St., North Beach and Chinatown. A lot of walking to be sure but we enjoy being active and it's a good way to see all the neighborhoods. The valet is very pricey $60/night but the ""self park"" is actually assisted parking around the corner where you have to wait for them to get your car. The $20 extra is worth the valet service. They'll have your car at the front at a certain time if you request it and they are very very friendly and helpful with directions. The lobby area is a bit chaotic but we didn't use it much nor did we go to any on site dining. The concierge desk is also helpful and easy to locate. The beds are very comfortable and our room was very quite - no street noise or noise from the hallways. I also felt very safe walking near our hotel at night. I would definitely stay here again.",2-Jan-14,4
"spend 4 nights there with family on club floor-informal check in, great service, terrific locationGym needs to be expanded and on a Sunday morning there literally wasn't a machine or a weight available-fabulous room on 30th floor with wall length windows and great viewsIt was service with a smile",1-Jan-14,5
"Rooms are all very clean and while chic and simple, also cozy and most with great views. The location is terrific. Did not eat in house so can't comment on that. Very pleasant stay and great staff from valets to front desk and cleaners ",1-Jan-14,5
"LOVE this hotel! It's a great location, right next to union square. My room overlooked it. Fantastic service. I had left my room for a couple if hours in the evening and when I returned, there was wine and cheese waiting for me in the room! A perfect before dinner appetizer. Amenities in the room were well appointed. I was welcomed with the tv on and a ""welcome"" was up on the tv with my name. They had just gone through a remodel of the rooms and it looked fantastic. Check in was easy and quick, an early check in at that. The staff was friendly and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again.",31-Dec-13,5
"We stayed here for three nights over Christmas and everything was perfect. The location can't be beat and the service was spot on. All the employees were helpful and friendly. The concierge really knew the city well. We liked that they had a small breakfast area (not in a restaurant) that served bagels, coffee, cereal etc. We had two connecting rooms for a family of 5 and they were both immaculate. Although the hotel was extremely busy, we still felt we got personalized attention! The only semi complaint is that the valet parking cost so much!",30-Dec-13,5
"I enjoyed our visit to San Francisco and our stay at the Grand Hyatt.Upon check in we were upgraded to a higher floor with a better view. With the upgrade they up charged me on my bill $50.00 per day and that was for the use of a club room. I didn't know that we had to pay for the upcharge as I would not have paid for the use of the room. They charge you for beer, wine and alcohol on top of the $50.00 not worth it. The food was marginal and the staff in the room spoke very broken English. Over all the staff was vary friendly and enjoyable to converse with. I would stay here again.",29-Dec-13,4
"The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in America. The staff are very friendly and professional. The room was so spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. Room service and the restaurant were excellent and the clam chowder was so yummy. Concierge were very helpful. The location couldn't have been better, Union Square is so lovely with great shops located nearby. I would strongly recommend staying here.",29-Dec-13,5
"Chose Grand Hyatt as one of our Hyatt program reward nights on our recent visit to San Francisco. This hotel stands right in the middle of all the shopping and dining action. We got the Union Square view room on the 29th floor. Nice view of the ice skating rink below and the Macy's building well decorated for the holidays. The christmas tree on Union Square was quite a sight at night. The furnishings and gadgets in the room and bathroom were top notch. Comfortable bed, beautiful view, location, free Wifi, professional and courteous staff, everything perfect. Only issue was with the valet parking which at $55 is way too expensive. There are a couple of parking garages in the immediate vicinity that are way cheaper if you don't intend to take your car out often. If you are here just for shopping, you do not need a car to move around the local area as everything is close-by.",29-Dec-13,5
We stayed here for the Fight Hunger Bowl and got a room on the 34th floor. We had a great view of the city from our room. The rooms were beautiful and very spacious. They were very clean and looked like they have been recently updated. The room is equipped with the latest in tech gadgets as well. The staff was very helpful including suggestions as to how we could get around the city and recommendations for dining. ,28-Dec-13,5
"We stayed in San Fransico for the last 49er home game and this place was amazing. We had never been to San Fransico before and really had know idea where to stay. I am so glad I choose the Grand Hyatt. We stayed for 4 nights and although it was very busy with Christmas shopping it was close to everything and worth every cent. Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. Even made our dinner reservations. I love this place. Work out center was amazing with views from the 35 floor, who wouldn't want to workout. Only down side was the noise, but what else would you expect with it being Christmas and everyone shopping last minute. Thank you Grand Hyatt for making my first time in San Fransico remarkable and unforgetable for my family and I.",27-Dec-13,5
"We had excellent service at check-in. They have a lot of elevators. The rooms are beautifully appointed in leather and wood. Nice bed. We had a view to the east, I think there are some to the north with a view of the Golden Gate. But our view was still pretty great. We ate in the lounge which had good options though the staff seemed overwhelmed. The place was slammed though but hey, it was the last weekend before Christmas in a hotel off Union Square. We drank in the bar (One Up I think) which was great fun. Only negative note was the concierge was pretty much useless. Gave us bad information, took forever, didn't know much. Pretty bad. But the rest of the experience was wonderful. But if you want a great lobby, stay at the Hyatt Regency which is simply spectacular. Would stay here again for a Union Square trip though.",27-Dec-13,4
"The room was quite expensive objectively, even if it was in line with other downtown hotels. Still, it was a reasonably good value in that everything at the hotel was spot on. The wifi was fast, the room was well appointed and clean. The Sutter Stockton Garage across the street was a cheaper, convenient alternative to the valet.",26-Dec-13,5
"It's my second time to stay in GHSF. The last time was before its renovation. This time with everything redesigned it's a whole new experience. The once dated lobby has become so modern. They allowed us to check in early at 9 am and the process was so smooth. We got a standard city view room with quite nice view (China Town, the Transamerica Pyramid and Coit Tower). The room was so clean and modern. My first time to see electric curtains in a hotel. At first we couldn't locate the room service menu. Later we found out that we needed to use the TV and the remote with a trackball to order. Choices are great and price is reasonable for a luxury hotel. The bed is the usual Hyatt grand bed and was thus good. Toiletries were now June Jacobs (the same as Grand Hyatt Hong Kong) and we're",25-Dec-13,5
"We just returned from a happy but exhausting weekend shopping trip to San Francisco.Our stay at the Grand Hyatt Union Square could not have been nicer.We arrived at 4 PM on December 20 and our connecting rooms on the 23rd floor were waiting for us upon our arrival.Our son was with us so he had his own room. He loves his privacy.I had read reviews here about the potential noise facing Stockton Street so I had requested and was given a ""city facing room"" which turned out to be excellent.The only noise we heard was an occasional faintly distant siren.My wife and I thought the bed was just one of the most comfy we have slept in forever.I had trouble getting her out of it to do some shopping and explore the Union Square area.As mentioned here by others, the bathroom lighting was great. My wife said it made putting her make-up on a cinch. I should also say the hotel's hallways are set up so that there is very little walking to one's roomand yet the elevators are positioned so that there is not a noise factor from them or the people using them. This can be a problem at some hotels but not this one.Our primary goal this trip was for shopping and we spent a great deal of time out and aboutdoing just that. The streets all around Union Square were overflowing with shoppers and it was a fun time to mingle with all of them.We met up with my youngest sister and family at the Macy's Men's Store down the street from the hotel. After a full day of shopping and visiting a million stores we all had dinner at Tony's in Little Italy over in the North Beach area of the city. Great food and fun time all around!We have been to San Francisco many times over the years and always enjoy our visits.I must say the Grand Hyatt Union Square will be our choice from this day forward.The personnel there could not have been more friendly and accommodating.I just want to give a very special thanks to Ron, William and Jessica who were as nice as one can be.My only complaint about our stay is and was that we had to leave and fly home.",24-Dec-13,5
"I travel to San Francisco for business a lot and I've stayed at quite a few hotels in the city and whenever the Grand Hyatt comes up on my company's travel booking system I look no further! The rooms are fantastic - brand new, super bright bathroom, excellent shower, very comfortable beds and accommodations. The views are amazing. The staff are great and check in is very fast ( they have multiple staff with laptops checking you in). The location is perfect. Starbucks is right outside the front door and a perfect location next to union square. ",24-Dec-13,5
My wife and I spent one night at the Hyatt during our coastal getaway. We upgraded to a room which had a view of Union Square. I highly recommend it. The hotel is modern but still has a warm feel to it. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorate. Only problem was water pressure. We will be back.,23-Dec-13,4
"My wife and I stayed in a standard room with a king bed on the 18th floor. The room itself was really nice, clean, and comfortable with a modern look and a lot of modern conveniences. Overall, I feel like staying here was a pretty good value. I only had two minor complaints. (1) Despite being 18 floors up, it seemed like a lot of city traffic noise still came through the windows. I live in a quiet suburb, so maybe I'm more sensitive to it than most people. (2) The only light in the bathroom is extremely bright. A nightlight would have been nice. Why? Because the door to the bathroom is translucent. So, if somebody goes to the bathroom during the night, you have to turn on a light that illuminates not just the bathroom, but the entire hotel room.",23-Dec-13,4
"Conveniently placed near the bustle of Fisherman's Wharf, but sufficiently set back to be quiet, this hotel offers almost everything- at a price. It would have been nice to have coffee-making facilities in the room, and the split-level reception area was a bit odd, and not too convenient when handling luggage. But efficient staff, and a pleasant stay- thank you.",21-Dec-13,4
"Nothing to complain about, but two things. The fan in my room was noisy and you had to pay for a fast Internet connection. Although, on the positive side, the free Internet Connection was not so bad after all. I would stay there again. Oh, and by the way, the restaurant was too small for breakfast, but the breakfast was excellent",19-Dec-13,4
"I used to live in the Bay Area, so it pains to have to stay in a hotel when I visit. Or rather, it pains my pocketbook to have to stay in a hotel when I visit.We chose the Grand Hyatt because of its location and because rates were discounted because of nearby construction. The hotel is modern and sleek, but not cold and unfeeling. Despite the apparent enormity of the building itself, the lobby and front desks feel contained in a small space.Breakfast is not complimentary here, nor would I recommend it. SF is a city brimming with cafes and patisseries. Coffeehouses are a charming part of the local experience, and are more memorable than the lobby cafe, which is unremarkable in any way.Our room was spotlessly clean and crisply decorated with cool greys, bright whites and right angles. The floor-to-celing windows overlooked Union Square. However the room itself was a shoebox. Space is at a premium in SF. The room had two double beds, not queen-sized. There was no room for much of anything else.Parking was $36 per day in a garage around the corner. Such is life in the City. Fortunately the car was unnecessary for getting around SF. The hotel is a short walk to cable car, MUNI and BART stops, and there are many sights to see in the immediate vicinity of the hotel such as Union Square shopping, and Chinatown.",18-Dec-13,4
"This hotel has been recently remodeled and unfortunately the ground floor is not very welcoming any more. I saw several people walk in and not understand how to use the self check in kiosks. There were workers at some of them and others were unmanned and people were wandering around the back sides of them not knowing where to go to get checked in. I think it's trying to be uber-modern euro style but it's just weird. I recommend that the hotel replace this stuff with a regular check in counter.My room was on the 12th floor and was clean and very comfortable and had a great view of the city. One concern with the room was that the heater did not work very efficiently. I had it cranked up all the way (outside was around 40 F) and it was just extremely slow and weak to warm up. I wonder if they have the heaters throttled so as to not waste electricity or something? Well regardless it was too cold. So I recommend that you talk to the front desk and make sure you can get them to get your room warm. Maybe they could have helped...The location was great and the immediate vicinity is clean and walkable and fairly low on homeless people. I very much appreciated the free wifi.I will stay here again for sure, but still recommend that the hotel consider going back to a more traditional reception desk and be aware of potential problems with the heaters.",18-Dec-13,4
"The hotel itself is very nice, which it should be for the price.What isn't so nice is the noise. The large windows in the rooms facing Stockton Street mean you will hear the doormen blowing a screeching whistle to hail cabs, and every conversation of people on the street.The other noise factor was that the walls are PAPER thin. ",15-Dec-13,4
"Great location - right on Union square for all of the shopping you could need. Only a few blocks from the trams that will take you along market street to either the wharf or to the Castro. Really comfortable room, clean and nice size (bay view room). AND, importantly, free wifi! Really great gym facility as well. ",13-Dec-13,5
"Overall, I love this hotel--I stay here every year. This year, however, there was something different about the hotel. Usually the bellmen are very welcoming--opening the doors as you go in and out of the hotel, greeting you upon your return, etc. This year, they would literally stand there, not greet you, and let you go up and open the door yourself (even when your arms were full). It was the strangest thing. They just didn't seem as happy as they were in the past. It was very cold so it could have been due to this...but it just seemed like their morale was low. I hope this will be remedied by next year because it really helps send a positive message to visitors when they take the time to greet you and welcome you back to the hotel. The rest of the stay was fine and I loved my room.",12-Dec-13,3
"found this ideal if you want a downtown hotel for buisness, not so much if your doing the sightseeing stuff. the hotel was under going a renovation when we were there so it all felt a bit un organized. but the rooms were nice with a city view.",11-Dec-13,4
"I rarely stay at Hyatt properties but this was the only hotel available (under $600) on one of my weeks in San Francisco. I was pleasantly surprised by the amenities, room decor/size, service, and an upgrade to VIP suite was given on my first stay. Delighted by the experience, I signed up for the Hyatt royalty program and have stayed at this hotel the last four business trips. Perhaps the bar was set too high after my first trip as my stays since have been ""fine"" to ""average."" The rooms are modern and spacious (for San Francisco), beds are comfortable, and the views are terrific - corner suites above the 30th floor. I appreciate that they don't charge for wireless and breakfast and bottled waters are included (with Business Plan or Club Lounge package). Watching the sunrise from the fitness room while on treadmill is uplifting and the facility is better than most hotels.OneUp bar drinks are fine - nothing special. Service is slow and often curt. There are better after-work bars and lounges nearby with Happy Hour. I would not recommend the food - not even the cheese tray.I've only had the breakfast buffet at the restaurant and wish they would switch up the menu for the regulars and for those who stay 2+ nights. The morning service at the restaurant has been consistently good, fast, and reliable. I am not a morning person, and they've been more than accommodating. Can't say the same for others...Service from front desk and door man have been mixed. Some are super friendly, courteous and helpful. Others barely make eye contact, speak with impatience, and don't bother to open the door for you. And the doors are heavy! I think a nice greeting as one enters the hotel would set the right tone for a guest's stay/return. I've never had to wait in line for check-in/out but have not always been able to check in early as requested.I've used the Club Lounge once and preferred the service here to the OneUp bar. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel for business travelers as long as you can tolerate the inconsistencies in service from different departments. Frequent business travel can be tiring, and sometimes, friendly and consistent service matters as much as (if not more than) nice spacious rooms.",10-Dec-13,4
My wife and I stayed at Grand Hyatt for the weekend while attending my best friend's wedding. The interior decor is superb. Super modern. Just the way I like it. The service was great. The staff was very professional and courteous through out. The only downside of staying at a hotel in downtown is the parking fee. It is not cheap.,8-Dec-13,4
"Enjoyed a 2 night stay on vacation. Very centrally located, room recently renovated and clean. Front desk and concierge desk staff friendly and helpful. Made our short stay in San Fran very enjoyable.",8-Dec-13,4
"This hotel is amazing. It totally blew me away from start to finish. It's super high-tech, so you check yourself in (some glitches, though, the keys the machine made me didn't work and I had to call for help but they came quickly and replaced them) and everything you need is on your TV remote. That didn't have batteries that worked, so maintenance came right up and replaced them and everything was A-1 from there. I really loved the room -- spacious, elegant, clean and relaxing, with Asian/modern decor and soft lighting. The bathroom was huge, the view beautiful, the bed sumptuous and the best part was the FOOD. I had the BEST French Dip sandwich I have ever had in my life. It was stacked thick with prime rib meat, carmelized grilled onions and real au jus. Just delicious! I will definitely stay at this hotel every time I am in San Francisco. Loved it!",4-Dec-13,5
"My husband and I were celebrating our news of pregnancy with dinner. As a spur of the moment thing, he told me to choose any hotel I wanted in the city. We had a wonderful experience before at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf, so I wanted to try this one. My mistake... The service was terrible! Let me break it down...1) Check in: My husband and I were waiting in line to check in, when out of no where, a woman with blonde hair came up to my husband asking ""Are you here to deliver food?"" My husband said no and she asked again, ""Oh so you're not delivering food?"" To which my husband responded, ""No... I'm checking in..."" Really?!? Okay... so my husband WAS holding a large brown bag, which was from our leftovers from dinner, but he was ALSO holding my hand... Incredibly rude! She didn't even apologize. She might want to ask, ""How may I help you this evening?"" next time so she doesn't make the mistake again. I wish I got her name...2) My husband and I reserved a room with a city view, but when we got to the room, we were hesitant to stay in it because it was adjoining, so I called down to the front desk to see if we can switch. The front desk associate told me that they had a room that was in a lower floor, but it was next to the ice machine. My husband and I decided to take our chances. When I got to the room, we I had a view of a parking structure, which was noisy all night... I had to do research on my own to figure out that we were downgraded... It would have been nice if they had told us straight out.3) I called down, letting the front desk know that we had not been notified that we were going to be downgraded and I wanted to make sure that our rate would reflect the downgraded rate... front desk said ""Okay, we will give you a refund..."" The bill gets slipped under our door in the middle of the night and of course... the rate was not adjusted....4) We did the breakfast package. My husband asked the host at the restaurant if we could take the food up to our room after we saw a few guests leave to the elevators with full plates, which she also saw. She said we could not, but then apologized. I wondered why the other guests we saw were an exception... As my husband and I were eating, the server placed the bill on our table, telling us if it was complimentary, to let the front know and pointed toward the hosts. My husband left to go back to the room because he wasn't feeling well. About 10 minutes later, I was about to leave to bring the bill to the host as the server had instructed when the very same server yelled ""EXCUSE ME, MA'AM!!!"" I was just a couple steps away from my table and him... There was no need to yell and embarrass me... I turned around and he said ""You have to fill that out!"" I told him that I knew I had to, but I thought he said to go bring it to the front to which is replied ""No. You leave it at the table."" Really... the only people that were friendly were the gentlemen doing the valet parking and the bartenders (especially Ben). It's ironic how the only name I cared to look at at that time was the only person who displayed genuine hospitality.",3-Dec-13,1
"We are avid Hyatt stayers and part of their platinum rewards program. We were in-town for Thanksgiving and received impeccable service at check-in and a gorgeous upgraded room with a view of the bay and Coit Tower. It made our Thanksgiving break and our city experience extra special. The beds are ultra soft, rooms impeccable and modern, and a great happy hour goes until 7 pm to top it off. We have frequented Park Hyatts in Paris and Sydney this year as well as the new Hyatt in New York. As close Central Coast dwellers, we will be back to this Hyatt as our go-to hotel for city excursions. Thank you, Hyatt!",29-Nov-13,5
"I surprised my daughter on her 16th birthday and whisked her away from Canada to SF and stayed at the Grand Hyatt this past weekend. From the moment we checked in, to the very moment we departed, our stay was absolutely fantastic! Since this was my first time in the city, I was looking for a central location and was I ever amazed at how close we were to everything! Shopping, restaurants, trams, cable cars, etc - you name it!The Hyatt is an upscale zen-style hotel with great modern rooms, a lovely clientele and plenty of smiles from the staff. We walked into a few other hotels and all this did was justify our decision to stay at this property. The executive floors are exquisite and access to the lounge was top-notch. Your private concierge is there to help you with anything you need. Breakfast was delicious and the views were breathtaking. Free Wi-Fi is also a big plus. The head concierge went out of her way to spoil us for our double celebration (birthdays) and I was so impressed - it was unbelievable. We felt so welcome there! I travel the world for business and have to say that the customer service at this hotel was outstanding. Whether you are there for work or for pleasure this hotel has it all. It was one of the best concierge services I have encountered. A huge thanks to TT for taking such special care of us and making my daughter's very special birthday such a terrific and exciting experience. We are already making plans to return with the family and will not stay anywhere else but at the Grand Hyatt. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit this spectacular city - and please note that I am a very picky traveller!Take the early-bird and audio tour of Alcatraz (what a production!), day trip to Sausalito and ride the cable cars and trams - great way to get around the city and see the sights! Great outdoor markets worth exploring and take your time to discover small little gems of stalls and local products.Thank you to all the TA specialists for SF in the forums - you guys were great helpers!TIP IF YOU WANT TO TREAT YOURSELVES : We took a beautiful new town car from the airport to the hotel with a great company called Pleasant Limo - excellent service and a nice way to start out our trip. On the way back, the hotel had a limo service available outside the front doors which was also fantastic.",28-Nov-13,5

"Having just joined the Hyatt program and having an incredible experience at the Park Hyatt Tokyo I was not expecting the same level of service or amenities here in San Francisco but little did I expect a marginally better than Motel 6 experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind if you book this hotel. 1) Location is great. Could not be better2) Rooms are small but adequate with abysmal housekeeping. Sheets not changed in 3 nights, lights not working, a shower handle falling off and general filth in the common areas. One is even wary of touching the buttons to the elevators they are so grubby. 3)DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR THE CLUB FLOOR...It is a children's playground. Breakfast tables and chairs are cluttered with food and screaming children. Evening drinks is even worse with last night 11.. yes 11 children playing games, scattering toys around and screaming while their parents slopped food all over the tables. We finally refused to eat breakfast in the club room and have avoided drinks in the evening. This despite the nicest manager, David who has no backup from management to do anything about the chaos in the too small room. Food is poor and wine selection is at best, cheap and cheerful.4) In general staff are very pleasant and helpful with some long time employees knowing how to anticipate guest's needs. That nothwithstanding no top management was in the hotel over the Thanksgiving period when I stayed. Utter chaos with no leadership5) If this is the standard of Hyatt hotels in the US then one better look for another program to join. I MOST CERTAINLY WILL. 6) Living in Asia and enjoying top level hotels the standard of this property at this price is shocking. Thank you to David in the Club room who tried and cared for his much disgruntled guests who experienced the horror of the Club room. Ripped off? Absolutely... will never return despite an annual visit to SF.",27-Nov-13,2
"As a Diamond member I was contacted 24hrs before my stay by Erica, a concierge team member, asking if I had any requests before I checked in. I usually thank someone for such a gesture and then politely respond ""I do not."" However we were not arriving until after 11pm (traveling from the east coast) so half kidding I wrote back saying ""It would be great to have In&Out waiting for us in the room.""I did not think anything of it until we arrived and there were Burgers, Fries and Milk Shakes (fresh) waiting for us in our room. I had made a strange, even outrageous, request and the concierge staff took care of it with ease. That is GREAT service!In addition - the room and views were beautiful. I will definitely be returning on my next trip to San Fran.",27-Nov-13,5
"As a native from San Francisco that currently lives elsewhere, what a welcome surprise to be treated in my hometown as a valued guest. From the moment we arrived the front desk representative was welcoming and helpful. Steve had a terrific personality, a friendly vibe, and a helpful attitude. He gave us an overview of the hotel and added in a bit of the history of the hotel. Our 14th floor room was quiet, beautifully decorated and was immaculate. I've stayed everywhere in the city and this is my new favorite hotel. The food is delicious and our breakfast that was included with our room was perfect. We couldn't have asked for more, and we will definitely be back very soon.",26-Nov-13,5
"I stayed here for my birthday weekend and when I first arrived it was about 3pm and the traffic to get into union square was ridiculously hectic. There is no official parking structure for the hotel but there were other available nearby structures for $37 a night except Sunday for $18. Then upon checking in they found out it was my birthday and said they would send up a bottle if wine, how nice. The room was nice, clean, nicely decorated, free wifi and comfortable beds. The only reason I didn't give them the extra star is because they didn't bring me the cups I requested and prior to that placed me on hold for a long time. If you're looking to have a nice dinner get in a cab and head to Foreign Cinema, excellent.Pros: - Amazing location near union square- Clean and comfortable- Free wifiCons:- No official parking- Traffic around the area can get crowded during prime time so plan accordingly",25-Nov-13,4
"I stayed at this hotel for 7 days for a work conference. For conferences held as Moscone, this hotel is the perfect distance away-- close enough to walk, but far enough away that the madness has dissipated by the time you return ""home"".First, the only small complaints I have are minor:The front door guys aren't staffed enough to effectively open the doors at all times. For those times there aren't enough, they need to have auto door openers. The doors are large and glass and heavy. They had some nice self check in options, but seemed to guide everyone to humans. I'm someone who would have preferred to check myself in, but was guided to a human line. I didn't prefer that.I had an annoyance that my room often wasn't cleaned by 3 p.m., when I'd often return from the conference and get ready for dinner. I made a single tweet about this displeasure and they replied to me right away and fixed it. Very pleased with this service.We had the breakfast buffet each day. It was nice. The lounge area has very high ceilings and 3 mini living room setups with TV's and a fireplace. A great ""great room"" common area to meet, relax, people watch or wait for your team. The elevators were fast & efficient without losing your stomach. I stayed on the 28th floor and faced Alcatraz. I was very pleased with the view and with the room. The room was appointed nicely in a good mix of modern luxury. The bed was good and the pillows were simply fantastic and luxurious. I wanted to go home with my luggage full of them! (I did photo the brand) My particular room was 2805, and happened to be right next to the ice machine. This generally was not a problem. The bathroom was nice, and the lighting around the mirror was also absolutely fantastic. Bright enough but mellow enough to make everyone look fantastic. Nice trick on that one ;) The TV worked fine and had some internet options that I did not take advantage of. I used the free internet and it worked well for my every purpose including video streaming. They offer a premium service and I suppose at some times it might be necessary for more bandwidth hungry applications, but during this visit it worked great for me. The room was on the high end of acceptable cost for a business trip, but we had few options. In the end, we were quite pleased with the service, hotel and location and I could imagine we will come back as a team if we attend this conference again in the future.",24-Nov-13,5
"We recently went to San Francisco just for the night. We packed in two days of activities and loved coming back to this hotel as home base. The location couldn't be better! The room was very nice and included a night shade remote by the bed so you can make it dark whenever you want. Also in the City I worry about noise coming through the room from the street. This wasn't an issue. It's such a solid, nice hotel with nice rooms and thick windows :) I didn't need my earplugs.The valet parking guy was a little snooty that we opted to park in their self park lot across the street but whatever! It saved us about $20.00 or more I think. The hotel check in staff were very friendly. The view from our room was wonderful, we opted for the city view room.I don't think you can go wrong staying here!",24-Nov-13,5
"I completely recommend this hotel. I recently stayed here 2 nights on a business trip where the conference was held in the hotel on the 36th (top) floor. The views from the top were EXCELLENT! My room on the 18th overlooked Union Square. The room was well appointed and clean. Bed was very comfortable. Loved the bathroom, the closet and the work/desk area. Staff was excellent and friendly. I did not eat in the restaurant or drink in the bar, and why would I when I'm in the heart of San Francisco. I will stay here the next time I come to San Francisco.",23-Nov-13,5
"We stayed at this Hotel a few years ago and it was a very nice experience. After the $100 Million Modern renovation, it is really only caters to Business travel. Not really a place to bring your kids. I booked an ""Executive Suite"" in Advance with the Hotel. When we arrived we went to our Suite and I noticed there were no roll-away beds for my two children to sleep on. Even after it was confirmed before we arrived. The manager on duty was rude and indifferent. She informed me that it is a fire hazard to have 2 roll-away beds in the Suite.Even AFTER this Suite was confirmed weeks before we arrived. Now mind you, I have stayed at many other Hyatt Hotels and ""Executive Suites"" are large with ample room for a family. BUT, NOT AT THIS HOTEL. I finally got through to the director of rooms and after a long redundant conversation they worked with me...FINALLY. So again, I am NOT staying here with my family anymore.",23-Nov-13,4
"We spent a weekend at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square and were absolutely impressed by our room and the service we received. We were familiar with the so-so hotel prior to the major renovation they made and all we can say is that it is a night and day difference. The decor is now modern and tasteful and the staff were wonderfully accommodating for a wonderfully enjoyable birthday weekend. The lounge in the lobby area featured great appetizers, decent drinks, and the live music featured there was some of the best I've ever experienced at a hotel chain. Hyatt made a big investment in upgrading this property top to bottom and it clearly shows. Now when I want to get a room in San Francisco at Union Square, this is my new go-to place.",22-Nov-13,5
"The location was good, near Union Square and good for shopping and dining, everything in walking distance. Only about 15 minutes from the airport (in good traffic). The room was clean and modern, the staff were friendly. It was a very busy hotel. We ate in the restaurant which is where the experience declined, not a great selection my meal was average and my son was not impressed - we had to go and find a snack afterwards!! Parking was expensive, but that is normal for San Francisco as parking is very limited in the center. Overall a good time.",20-Nov-13,3
"Stayed here in October for 5 nights on the 1st leg of a trip.Pretty nice hotel with a good bar that serves good food, rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable and the concierge were helpful. A great base to explore San Francisco from.",19-Nov-13,5
"Fantastic location - middle of Union Square facing Macy's, Bloomingdales, etc. Fantastic staff - everyone was so courteousFantastic food choices Just a lovely hotel option, had a great King size room facing Macy's/Union Square. I would definitely stay again if I could in San Fran.",18-Nov-13,5
"The hotel was nice, newly re-innovated with excellent location. It is only walking distance from union square and the market street, where most of the brands are available. The service was nice with good price value. We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. The room was wide, modern and the bed comfortable and clean. The room service was good with variety of choices.I highly recommend this hotel for families vacation and business trips.",17-Nov-13,4
"We had 6 nights here in Nov. All staff were very helpful. Room was fabulous and totally renovated, we looked out straight into union Square. The King Bed and pillows were so comfortable. The location is perfect as it is right in the heart of Union Square with all the restaurants and shops and only 2min walk to get on the tram to Fisherman's Wharf or 2 blocks to the underground if you want to go further which we did to Oakland Stadium to watch the Oakland Raiders. Also really handy for the hop on hop off bus. So glad we choose this hotel and would love to stay there again. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt.",16-Nov-13,5
"The hotel has a perfect location for public transportation, (BART, MUNI and cable car) walking distance to Fisherman's Wraf and AT&T ball park. The entrance has a beautiful atrium with interior restaurants and bar. Accommodations are very nice and each rooms have excellent views of the city. ",16-Nov-13,4
"I was (am) here on a very short business trip and could not have been happier with my stay at the Grand Hyatt. First, the location is absolutely perfect - about a block to Union Square, close to shopping, China town, etc. Second, the atmosphere is spot on for modern, chic, and relaxing. Love the music, the design of the space (lobby and restaurant/bar) as well as the colors. Very much enjoy the fireplace/literary theme. Room - spacious and the bed is very comfy. Love the view from my room on the 16th floor and the automatic shade. Bathroom amenities are modern.OneUp restaurant/bar - again, love the design and the atmosphere. The bartenders were friendly and helpful. Live music on a Friday night was great and perfect for a glass of wine after my business event. Could have some healthier food nibbles in the bar section, but still good. The breakfast spread was nice, though a bit pricey. Overall - great stay, friendly and helpful staff. Loved the atmosphere. Spot on for what I was looking for. Will definitely come back in the future. Hopefully, not just for business!",16-Nov-13,4
Had a 3 night stay at this beautiful hotel. Entrance very open and classy. Bellman always got the door for you and a taxi. About a 10 minute brisk walk to convention center or 8.00 cab ride. Great food. A little pricey. 40.00 salad was amazing from room service. More homeless than I have seen in awhile. Didn't feel threatened but uncomfortable. ,15-Nov-13,4
"We stayed for 3 nights last week in Room 1009The bed/pillows are the worst that we have ever slept on. Not fitting of Grand Hyatt.It is so ""spongy"" and none of the pillows accorded any support whatsoever.....my wife and I both ended up with stiff necks.There is a gap of about an inch between the main door and the carpet - so every single word and footsteps filters right into the room.The breakfast room is cramped. Very poor value.Concierge - especially Mark - is very courteous.We chose the Courtyard by Marriott (even though it is not so centrally located) on our return from Tahoe a week later and slept like logs.",14-Nov-13,1
"The best thing about this hotel would be that it is located right in union square. You are steps away from some great restaurants and all of the department stores. Cheese cake factory is right across the street on the 7th floor of Macys.The rooms have all just been renovated so the rooms and washrooms are very nice and modern looking. Rooms and washrooms were very clean. Beds were very comfortable as well.My fiance and I had tickets for the city sightseeing tour buses, which was perfect because you can hop on and hop off right infront of macys which is almost right outside of the hotel.Would recommend buying tickets for the hop off/on tours because you can save a lot of money by using these buses to get to all of the popular attractions. The next time we visit San Fransisco we are staying at the Grand Hyatt again!",12-Nov-13,4
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt for a conference. From the time I arrived at the valet to the time I checked out, I had an enjoyable stay. The Grand Hyatt just recently completed renovations of the hotel and they had awesome amenities in the lobby and guest rooms. It was a very comfortable stay. The staff was also extremely professional and friendly. And you can't ask for a better location when staying in San Francisco.",12-Nov-13,4
"The hotel was recently remodeled so very clean, and modern. Only problem was the cable and internet went out on the second day, the staff promptly addressed it. Numerous calls we made to accommodate us. Including complimentary buffet breakfast for the remainder of our trip. I would definitely return. The location is excellent for great shopping and dining.",12-Nov-13,4
"I was in town for a conference at the Moscone Center. The Hyatt is a short walk (4-5 blocks), but the Hyatt is in a great location. But I was more impressed with the staff. Each member from the doormen, to the operator, to the front desk, to the restaurant waiters were just friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. An example was wanting to go for a walk to help offset jet lag. When asking in the lobby they asked me: how long, what would you like to see while you are out, etc. From there they set a nice course. Having lunch one day before a meeting, I wanted something just a little different than an item on the menu and they quickly said no problems. At check-in I felt more like a long standing repeat guest at a small resort. This type of attention just makes a stay feel better. Finally the room was quite nice and update. Also was equipped for working with all your electronics. I would stay here again.",12-Nov-13,5
"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco in early October, 2013. This was our first time at this particular hotel. To say we enjoyed our stay would be an understatement. Our room was very clean and well appointed. My birthday happened to be on one of the days we were there. The hotel sent to our room a complimentary bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese tray. How nice was that! I need coffee in the morning. The hotel provides a coffee bar, which opens at 5 a.m. (yeah for early risers). Coffee is not free, but it's a small price to pay for your caffeine fix. The only concern we had is that housekeeping missed cleaning our room on one of the 4 nights we were there. The exercise room is fully equipped for cardio and weight training exercises. Beautiful view of the city while on the treadmill. We will definitely go back to the Grand Hyatt on our next visit to the City by the Bay! GO NINERS!",11-Nov-13,5
"I stayed for 4 nights in grand hyatt San Francisco and I loved it!Nice and friendly staff especially the Conceirge team, all staff are so friendly and courteous!!Just a bit few choices during the cocktail hours at Grand Club.. Hyatt in Asia have wide range of food and drinks to choose from.. This is the only thing I think it can be improved.. Other than that everything is excellent and I will visit again for sure!",10-Nov-13,4
"i had a chance to stay at the grand hyatt in SF. loved it!the view was breathtaking... i was on the 25th floor... had the view of union square and Macy's:)watching the sun rise and set is pretty amazing:)the staff were all very professional and courteous:) everything i asked for, they delivered:)highly recommend",6-Nov-13,4
Super fast check in. AMAZING Bay View room with sweeping views of the city. Updated and modern furnishings and super clean room. Comfy bed and pillows. Fantastic location in the heart of the action. I simply cannot wait to stay here again. Highly recommend to anyone visiting San Francisco!,5-Nov-13,5
"Extremely comfortable beds, nice rooms, Excellent service...you really can't go wrong. We had an issue with noise and it was rectified immediately. They could offer bottled water in the rooms...that would be the only complaint. I would love to return soon!",4-Nov-13,4
"I stayed at this hotel for a business conference. From the greeting at the front desk to the bar, everyone was extremely helpful. The location is a shopaholic's paradise-Hermes, Barney's, Saks, and way too many other stores to name. This hotel underwent a remodel; so the rooms and the entire place feels very clean. Take time out to visit the top floor where you get a great view of the city. My only critisim was around the weekend. There were thousands in town for a marathon and hearing cannons, loud music and a bunch of screaming folk at 4:30 in the morning wasn't great...however, the hotel did give us a heads up. All in all, I'd stay here again.",2-Nov-13,4
"Fair Disclosure: I was doing business with Hyatt Corp. Reality Check: I do business with a lot of hotels and strive for a balanced review providing details on things that travelers want to know bout.My two-night stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco hit high marks on everything this business traveler was looking for: convenient location, service, food, business comfort, bed, bath, and cleanliness. My WiFi was free, as I was on a club floor - with a delightful view towards Nob Hill (Mark Hopkins). But in an era where work-friendly desks are given over to more floor space or other furniture, I had plenty of outlets to plug in, spread out, and while away in a decent ""task"" chair.Other basics, such as cleanliness, bed & linens, adequate towels and shower items were just what you'd expect in a Grand Hyatt. But the thing this woman, given to spending time in front of the mirror for hair and make-up, absolutely loved was the bathroom lighting, especially around the mirror. Make-up artists and theater folks will immediately clue in on the natural-spectrum lighting and full-surround of the mirror. It is hard enough to find this in most residences, and even rarer in hotels. And dirt or grunginess in the bathroom has no place to hide in a bathroom with lighting like that! And counter space - yep, I had counter space!Good water pressure in a glass enclosed shower was just what I needed to freshen and prepare for the day.A few other business-related things worthy of mention - the club-floor room on 32 was perfect for breakfast and business planning with colleagues. If you have need for a private meeting, try out the private dining room at their restaurant OneUP for a unique space excellent for a small grouplooking for a bit of seclusion while breaking bread. An interesting combination of rustic and modern, the wood paneled room is lit with sculptural fixtures and a wood dining surface closer to eco-art.than just a table.Lots of tourists are right around Union Square, but you can't beat it for accessibility - from the airport, to Moscone, to BART stations - its in the middle of everything. For a high-level business stay, I suggest the modern and renovated Grand Hyatt.Just for fun: take a peek at the restrooms outside the lower level meeting rooms - high design and technology meet up in a public washroom.",1-Nov-13,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt from 10/25 - 10/27. Several of my friends and I were in town for a wedding. The hotel's service from Friday afternoon when I arrived through Sunday when I checked out was impeccable across the board. The room was very clean, the hotel staff went above and beyond to meet my requests (bringing me a tooth brush / tooth paste an hour before the wedding while I was getting ready Saturday morning), the hotel bar / restaurant staff was excellent. A restaurant patron accidentally knocked over a plate, which smashed into the ground, and actually made a small cut on my hand. The staff and management of the restaurant comped drinks for us and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and I was okay. The front desk / concierge service is friendly and provides helpful details. The Grand Hyatt made me feel comfortable, relaxed, and like I was truly on vacation. I would love to stay here again.",30-Oct-13,5
"I've stayed here already twice and loved it both times. The location is perfect and the service is outstanding. Also, I really enjoyed the lounge - the view from there is definitely breathtaking. The bartender at the lounge was incredibly nice and took several pictures of me and my then-girlfriend - thanks again for that :)",29-Oct-13,5
"This ultramodern hotel is in a great location, and the view from the rooms are amazing, the bathroom was clean and large and the beds were very comfortable, the TV had lots of information about San fran and you could order room service on it! Free wifi is appreciated but the only thing was the food in the restaurant wasn't great and the room service is crazily priced even for normal room service, I would definitely stay again. ",28-Oct-13,5
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt from October 23 through October 27. It is a great hotel located in a great area. Room on the 19th floor was well put together. Great view. Beds were extremely comfortable. Staff could not be more helpful. They gave us a list of local restaurants and we put it to good use.,28-Oct-13,5
"Stayed here on the recommendation of a friend - would not trust their choice again! Rooms are small and dingy and the A/C noisy. Charging for WiFi typified this hotel; any chance to exploit the guest was taken.Probably my fault for staying at a hotel that was clearly for business people on expense accounts, but other Hyatt around the world have been very reliable.",28-Oct-13,2
Had the pleasure of staying at this hotel recently for a meeting. Check-in was efficient and the people and staff were very friendly--even upgraded me without me asking. The room was clean and bed very comfortable. Used the workout room with an amazing view. Free wi-fi with good access. Close to transportation and meeting venue,27-Oct-13,4
"My partner and I just returned from a trip to San Francisco and a stay at the wonderful Grand Hyatt. We had previously stayed at this hotel prior to it's remodel and thought the room was dated. What a wonderful difference this stay. The room was modern, the bed very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed. We arrived very late on a Wednesday night and although we had reserved a room that would have been on a lower floor, only two doubles were available not the king we reserved. Paul at the front desk worked some magic and gave us a king on the 25th floor with a wonderful city view ( we could see bay on each side). When he heard we were in town to get married, he made sure we received a special treat delivered to us the next day ( cupcakes and sparkling water).The room was very clean and the maid was very attentive to our needs. The large windows had wonderful views, especially in the evening. The room features a safe, an iron and ironing board, plenty of hangers and a coffee maker. The hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance of shopping, market street, Chinatown and Nob Hill. The staff was wonderful, very friendly and extremely helpful.We truly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt and look forward to staying there again in the future.",27-Oct-13,5
"Very close to Union Square, one of the best place in San Francisco.Some drawbacks were: breakfast, which is very simple and conversely too expensive; the charge for every package shipped on my name, besides the late for delivering the packages.",27-Oct-13,3
"We stayed here for the 4th of July celebrations this year. The service and staff were impecable. I loved the location right on Union square with more shopping than anyone could ever want! The rooms overlooking the square were great, and all the Hop-on/Hop-off tours start here, so it really is centrally located. The rooms are quite compact, but have been refreshed. The restaurant and bar were excellent, and concierge service was extremely helpful.Overall a great stay.",24-Oct-13,5
"We stayed in this hotel for two nights on the way to Hawaii and were very impressed. The hotel is very stylish, the communal areas as well as the rooms, which were an excellent size for a city hotel. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds extremely comfortable. The location is brilliant, a 10 second walk to Union Square. We would definitely stay here again although even though we were on the 14th floor we still heard a fair amount of street noise, which we fully expected in a city centre hotel, however we would probably chose a room not overlooking the street (and the fabulous views) as a compromise. There was some work going on on the top floor which makes for a stunning viewing platform, whatever the hotel plans to do with it. ",24-Oct-13,4
"I stayed here for five nights and enjoyed the experience. This hotel has special PURE rooms specially designed for guests who have allergies. The room was immaculately clean, there were no feather pillows or down comforters in the room, a HEPA air filter was running to remove any airborne irritants and the toiletries were unscented and hypo-allergenic. It was wonderful!Additionally, this hotel is excellently located in San Francisco, within walking distance to so much of what the city has to offer. The service was excellent and the room was quiet and comfortable.There's one thing to be aware of, however. If you have a room on the east side of the hotel, the sun bakes the room by 10:00 am. The rooms have metallic mesh blinds to filter light, but the only way to avoid the hot sun is to use the motorized black-out shade and then you're literally in the dark. Plan to be out enjoying the city before 10 if you have an east-facing room.",24-Oct-13,5
"This is by far the best location SF. Overlooking the union square, it is much walkable to every tourist location be it Pier 39, cable car station, ferry building etc. Union Square has all the best brands in the world. It comes alive early in the morning till late in the night, never disappoints to buzz.I recommend this Hotel to all those who are going to SF for the first time.Dont forget to try the cheese cake of the hotel.",23-Oct-13,5
"The Grand Hyatt in Union Square is quite the hotel. This is the first stay in this property and would definitely stay here again. The location is within walking distance to lots of great shopping, Chinatown and North Beach. If you bring your walking shoes, Fisherman's Wharf and the Financial District are not that far away either. The hotel room was nicely updated with a modernistic electric shade, modern work station and bathroom. Being on the 23rd floor facing San Francisco Bay did not hurt my impressions either, looking out at Coit Tower, the Transamerica Building and Alcatraz every morning. I could hardly take enough pictures. Online check-in and out made the whole experience painless.",23-Oct-13,5
"We came here as a group to run the Nike Women's Marathon. We were greeted by friendly staff and they were helpful throughout our stay; from the wait staff at the restaurant, the bell men, the maintenance man and cleaners. We had one problem at the restaurant due to a new menu, but the manager was very professional with his apology. The rooms were lovely. The bed and pillows were comfortable.The location was fabulous. It was a block from union square and close enough for a longer walk to the piers. The bell men were very helpful in giving directions. It was a block away from the 30 bus, which we took to Girardelli, but could be used to get to Chinatown, as well. I would stay here again!",23-Oct-13,5
"Nice property and well priced for the location. Check in desks were a little confusing but efficient once you got there. Housekeeping seems well trained. I, too, disliked the lock- less, sliding, frosted bathroom doors, but the rest of room was thoughtfully designed. ",22-Oct-13,4
"The rooms are tight, but nicely updated have all the amenities you need.The econcierge lets you get razors and shaving lotion, corkscrews, and shoe horns before you arrive. The location is very convient to the convention center, china town and north beach.window treatments are metallic and work great.Will be here again in the spiring.",22-Oct-13,4
"Since the hotel has been remodeled, now the place equals the benefit of location and ambiance -- great views - the restaurant is ""interesting"" in a positive way. Recommended for shopping, theatre location and being in the center of San Francisco   ",22-Oct-13,4
"Very handy to be right in the centre, and only 2 minutes walk from Union Square.Handy to be located so close to Super Duper burger too.The rooms are a good size, tho the large window did get stuck on my room so I could hear the noise from outside.Good facilities too.",22-Oct-13,4
We recently returned from an 8 day break in Las Vegas and San Francisco.We stayed at two separate hotels in San Francisco & this hotel was without a doubt the best we stayed at. Centrally located on Union Square and near to big attractions. The staff were very welcoming and friendly & went out their way to make this a special trip for us. Helpful Concierge and got a late check-out with reception also. Thanks!,22-Oct-13,5
"Nice hotel located in the heart of it all. Remodeled rooms which was the main reason I booked this hotel. Always a great welcome walking in the hotel. We had requested a higher floor and they accommodated us which was great. The reason I'm not giving an ""excellent"" score is because of one detail which for most will not be a big issue. The bathroom is new but the ""bath/shower"" area bothered us. We had a typical bath with a shower curtain. I guess we didn't expect to have a plain shower curtain in a Grand Hyatt. Usually you'll get a glass shower or something a bit more modern and hygienic than a shower curtain. Not a major issue but again we were a bit surprised to have this in a Grand Hyatt; considering that everything in the room had a modern feel. We stayed 5 nights and our stay was nice. Again, location is amazing!",21-Oct-13,4
"Disclaimer: My son works for the Hyatt organization.My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, from October 5 to October 10. This is by far one of the finest run hotels I have ever stayed at. Everything went smoothly, every employee at the hotel were helpful and pleasant, especially the fantastic concierge service. The guestrooms have all been recently redone are extremely roomy and comfortable.The in room dining service, always served hot and on time.If you're staying in San Francisco, whether it for business or pleasure, I highly recommend staying at the Grand Hyatt.",21-Oct-13,5
"We stayed here during a recent trip to SF for a conference and found the hotel to be very nice, although we probably wouldn't have stayed there if we didn't get a huge discount. The room was really nice and the power shade was cool, as was the view of Union Square and the rest of the city, especially at night. I didn't give it a rating of five because it is a bit louder than expected, but it may not be as bad in rooms that do not face the square.",21-Oct-13,4
"The Grand Hyatt was a great place to stay in SF. We paid extra to get the bay view, and it did not disappoint - wow! We did not eat in the hotel restaurants at all - there were so many things nearby (even a Starbucks across the street!). The room was large and bed comfortable. I would have given them a 5 star, except there was a meal charge on our bill that was not ours, which I went down and told them about. They told me they took it off, but when we got home, we found it on our credit card statement. At checkout, we wanted to be sure it was not there, but they told us they were paperless so did not print us out a copy of our bill! At home we had to dispute it with the credit card company before Hyatt finally credited us. Watch your bills and charges!! Other than that, the hotel itself was very nice.",20-Oct-13,4
"I have never done a review here before, however, for the Grand Hyatt San Francisco I just had to!This is such a great hotel. We stayed for a week whilst visiting family and it was the first overseas trip for our 7 month old.As any parent knows, any trip with a baby is a trial in itself but the staff at the Grand Hyatt were more than accommodating and couldn't of done more to make our stay comfortable!The room was fantastic and had such an amazing view overlooking Union Square.Anything we requested ( such as a crib and a kettle for babies milk) was provided to us within minutes of us asking. We were also allowed to check out late so that we didn't have to hang around or walk the streets with the baby!The staff are friendly, courteous and seriously cannot do enough for the guests.The coffee shop has amazing coffee too!!Many thanks to all at the Grand Hyatt for making our stay so great!!",20-Oct-13,5
"Usually, a hotel will spend top dollar to have an amazing lobby & less on their rooms. This hotel did just the opposite, which is great for we travelers who like a comfy, well laid out room!China Town is steps away & Union Square 1 street in front of the hotel. That said, on a Friday & Saturday night it gets really loud, even 34 floors up. The rooms are really nice with a great ""new"" feel & well laid out (with a huge shower, perfect for 2, with only 1 shower head) & we had great sunset views. There is a Starbucks across the street (yay!!) & the breakfast buffet downstairs was good, with a very attentive staff. The lobby is what I would describe as casual (with modern check-in stations) but there is a nice sitting area where people we're enjoying chilling out, much like an over sized den, in a giant (high rise) home.The negatives: valet parking was a whopping $55.00 a day. Self parking is 35? Crazy! I suggest bringing some good walking shoes. Even taking one of their charming trolly's is expensive & mostly just for tourists, I notated. If your from NY none of this will even phase you.",18-Oct-13,4
"The hotel, rooms and gym are beautiful, The location is in the heart of the city and shopping!! The staff very friendly.The view from our room looking at the bay. The hotel is updated and remodeled looks like new. Checking in was easy. We would recommend staying at this Hyatt and our family will be back to stay in the near future.",17-Oct-13,5
"Excellent hotel that is recently renovated and decidedly upscale with great views along with great staff. Newly configured decor with a very unique way of checking in that I personally do not appreciate because it is so confusing with little privacy, but good effort.The best executive lounge that I have seen in years and I applaud the hotel management for making it great. Open throughout the day and offering great breakfast and evening snacks and drinks, i am sure Diamond and Platinum members will appreciate the convenience. Others who have paid to be on the lounge floor will also be pleased.Next to Union Square and close to Moscone Center, this hotel is great for those attending conventions nearby. Very expensive if you don't get the right rate since the management refuses to budge from highest rack rates if you missed getting the negotiated rate - even when rooms are avaial",17-Oct-13,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt with my husband.Waited half hour for room to be ready in the upscale comfy lobby and promptly called when room was ready. Given a gorgeous 29th floor with city view. Hotel is very upscale in terms of decor....fancy touches like remote controlled window coverings made it feel luxurious. The Hyatt has a long list of free toiletries that can be called for. Highly recommend the bath robe and lint mitts.In all, very pleased with this hotel. Also breakfast buffet is pricey but delicious!",16-Oct-13,5
"This hotel is ideally situated for visiting San Francisco or attending a convention. Warm and genuine welcome, efficient staff . My room, although not very large had absolutely everything I needed and extremely comfortable - it was perfect for my needs. I had access to the club floor - the view from there is unbelievable! Wonderful breakfast included with the club floor and also appetizers in the evening. Overall an extremely pleasant experience.I found the ability to check-in/out online at the lack of an old fashioned check-in desk pleasant and convenient.",16-Oct-13,5
"we stayed at Hyatt for just 2 nights during our trip to San Francisco, very good location for those who want to be close to Union Square and China Town. I understand that locals prefer this area, but if you are there as a tourist you might also consider the Pier, this is where most tourists like it. The rooms are nice and spacious, staff is friendly, considering the prices in San Francisco, rate is also acceptable. we didn't try the restaurants, but there seemed a lot going on, they were putting a lot of effort to get the guests to restaurants. Lobby at the entrance was very cosy also, good area to get some rest after a busy day and watch around. ",16-Oct-13,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a work conference and the location was awesome. Everything is within walking distance - Starbucks directly across the street, Walgreens around the corner, Macy's a couple blocks away, restaurants, Cable cars, etc. The reception staff were welcoming and provided us with suggestions of where to eat, since we arrived late on a Friday night. Room service was great and prompt and the food was delicious. We tried the lounge on site one night and the drinks were excellent, they even had live music which was great.The cons? The room for us was adequate but nothing special. We were placed on a quiet floor, which we had requested in advance, which was great. However, the room was pretty ""plain Jane"" for paying $320 per night. It must simply be that price for the location. The bathroom was small and was lacking in towel racks or hooks; there was no where to hang the hand towels, etc, which we thought was odd. The shelf in the bathtub was broken and the water pressure from the shower was less to be desired. The king bed was comfortable, but I questioned the cleanliness when I saw a few stains on the sheets and woke up one morning with bites all over one leg. There were no light switches in the room, you had to turn on each lamp individually, which seemed a bit dated.We used the concierge service several times and found them to be less than hospitable. We felt like we were a nuisance when asking questions and one lady, couldn't get us out of the way fast enough so she could answer the phone.The location is excellent, but because of the issues with the room and the price we paid for it, I might not stay there again.",14-Oct-13,3
We have just returned from this hotel and found it a nice hotel to stay at . The hotel is well located near Union Square and China Town . The rooms are good with good views over the city from higher floors . We ate in the restaurant one night and found it a nice experience with good service and food options .As a family this hotel did the job without wowing us . We would probably stay closer to Fishermans Wharf next time as it would offer more for us to browse at a walkable distance from the hotel.A good hotel although not really aimed at families.,13-Oct-13,4
customer service at this hotel is perfect! -great bar in the middle of things -great food. -cute little gift shop with nice San Fran things to purchase.....only thing needed is an upgrade on the room decor....otherwise awesome hotel,11-Oct-13,4
"i stayed both in the old and new rooms and location remains top.The new rooms are well appointed, and to me the colors & decorations are nice.The club has fantastic views too, nice staff. However i am still amazed about all hyatt Clubs in the USA charging for wine and alcohol whereas this is not the case in Europe and Asia where I spend most of my time.One evening we had dinner in the restaurant of the hotel and I was surprised about the extremely attentive and great staff as well as the quality of food. They spend a lot of effort in the food being authentic and health conscious. No need to go outside if your r too lazy or on a rainy day, its does the job well.The single drawback I find is that they kept the old doors, some rooms they have a lot of space at the floor leaving true a lot of light as well as sound. Also the doors are not well isolated against noise and somehow people always seems to be loud in the hallway in the USA. Dont have a clue why.And the hotel management should do something about clearing the hallways with all the roomservice trays standing around for hours, ours for 2 days.....All in all, I recommend this hotel.",11-Oct-13,5
I have stayed here a couple times and have had good experiences. It's a safe bet and the rooms are nice. Close to a couple parking garages and about 5 blocks from Bart. Prices are decent but naturally go up during large events. Close to Union Square. ,10-Oct-13,4
"Had a really good stay here. All public areas are very modern and tidy, but I'm not sure if I like the 'informal' reception area (other reviewers have said the same).Room was very nice and faced Union Square. Bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean and modern. Room service food was very good (breakfast).Perhaps it may be an idea to say about the electronic blinds in a piece of the in-room literature! Location is great being right off of Union Square, with an easy walk to shops and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again if back in San Francisco. :)",10-Oct-13,5
"Our room was recently updated, with pleasant, modern decor. Updated bath with modern amenities, but only a single sink and no separate toilet or shower.Tub shower with shower curtain. Nice soft goods and very nice bed and linens.Free Wi-Fi. Small exercise room on top floor.This very large and busy hotel can be noisy. We heard noise from the streets outside, even though we were on a high floor. Also, the door let in a lot of corridor noise.The hotel has one of the best locations for tourists. Steps from Union Square and the cable car line, and a block from the entrance to China town.Parking is impossible on the street, so you'll need to park in one of the nearby parking garages.You can walk to Fisherman's Wharf, which is 45-60 minutes up and down hills. We did it and got to see a lot of the city.",10-Oct-13,4
"Ok I had been sleeping in a RV for ten days but nevertheless I still think this was one of the most comfy hotels in I've stayed in! Excellent service, excellent bar with cracking happy hour 5 til 7 and electric blind which didn't break despite our constantly playing with it. We were in a king suite on 8th floor. You get what you pay for - it was not cheap!",9-Oct-13,5
Pretty nice location by Union Sq. Super nice lobby and the room are sweet but a bit on the small side. There are some convention centers downstairs as well. There was a motorized curtain in the room and the bathrooms have a sink that resembles a bathtub. There is also a gym on the top floor.,9-Oct-13,4
"easy access to everything. Great for when you're lugging your shopping hauls and you don't have to walk so far back! Hotel offered a very friendly, helpful staff, it was clean, & the amenities were second to none. Great happy hour & gym was worth getting up for just for the sunrise & view. Bartenders were knowledgeable of area & offered sound advice that proved true about sights & restaurants. Location is unbeatable if you're sightseeing - close to wharf, ferry building, North Beach, and of course Union Square. Cable car & busses are close too. It was a very enjoyable stay.",8-Oct-13,4
"On our arrival the man at the door who collected our bags informed me that I was the hotelâ€™s â€˜Guest of the Dayâ€™! At first I thought he was just joking but sure enough when I got to the check in desk this was confirmed by the person checking me in. This meant that I was able to choose from a list of free gifts, one of which was free limo ride back to the airport at the end of my stay, so having just paid over $50 to get to the hotel from the airport I decided to go for this. My room was also upgraded to one on a higher floor with a great view looking east towards some of San Francisco taller buildings and the bay area behind them. The room was very spacious, modern and clean. The bed was also very comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping.Even without my â€˜Guest of the Dayâ€™ experience I would still recommend this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were excellent. It is in a wonderful location just off Union Square (great area for shopping, restaurants, the stops for the hop on, hop off tour buses and also the San Francisco cable cars).Hopefully I will be back to San Francisco one day and if so would definitely look to stay at this hotel again.",8-Oct-13,5
"We stayed here for 3 nights on the 2nd stop of a tour of USA. Great location, right on Union Square. First impression of the room-WOW! More like a suite! It was really spacious, particularly so after staying in a small, but lovely hotel room in NYC. Huge room, ENORMOUS bed, floor to ceiling- wall to wall window, retro dÃ©cor, walk through dressing room leading to large, luxury bathroom. The bed was the comfiest bed ever! Massive deep mattress & so comfy topper, loads of huge soft pillows, crisp sheets, best nights sleep Ive ever had. Didn't want to get up in the mornings!! Almost a shame there was so much sight-seeing to be done! Top floor restaurant & bar was impressive, amazing panoramic views, when the fog lifts! So one night amazing views sat in the bar just having a drink, booked a table for the following night-FOG! But all adds to the experience. Loved this hotel",8-Oct-13,5

"I stayed with the Grand Hyatt in June and it was a really comfortable experience. The hotel's location is fantastic and right where all the shopping places are in Union Square. Great for when you're lugging your shopping hauls and you don't have to walk so far back! There are several dining options near the hotel as well which was great. Like what other reviewers had pointed out, Starbucks is just right across if you're looking for a quick fix. I had a nice Sunday brunch at the nearby Cheesecake Factory (in the Macy's building) and it was superb. The room was very comfortable for three adults and it was very modern and sleek as well. I did not feel that it was cramped at all though there were three of us in the room. The bed was heavenly and I fell asleep instantly every night. It was a little hard waking up the next day! We visited the bar & lounge one night and there was live music which was wonderful. The lounge area wasn't very large but it was really nice and I enjoyed it. I would definitely return to stay at the Grand Hyatt once again should i return to SFO.",7-Oct-13,5
"I stayed at this hotel in Sepember 2013 on a business trip. Excellent location, right off Union Square which is the shopping district. The hotel is very good. Rooms are modern and good size.My room was on the 26th floor and had a city view. Some of my other colleagues had excellent views of the bay from the same floor. They have friendly staff. Basic necessities like water and ice are available on each floor. The gym is on the 35th floor with breath taking views of the San Francisco Bay. They have a nice lounge + restraunt on the first floor. The hotel is located walking distance from several restraunts and bars. There is a Starbucks across the road and a Walgreens about 200m away. I would stay there again!",6-Oct-13,4
"My husband and I spent this past week at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco, and it was a modern, renovated hotel with a very friendly staff. Everyone was nice, and they treated my service dog particularly well which is something I appreciate. We had breakfast with our room, and the food was consistently good and very fresh. I loved the berries and the museli and would also suggest the banana pancakes. We had room service one day as well, and that was good, too. The location is great, near lots of shopping and right across the street from a Starbucks. It is a block from Union Square and we were able to take our dog for daily walks in the park. The only negative about the hotel is the small rooms. I'm not a fan of small hotel rooms, and this one is barely comfortable for two people. Overall, the hotel was nice and I'd stay there again. It is a typical city hotel that has modern but small rooms. Our room didn't have a great view, but it was comfortable and the food and bar made it very nice. I also liked the shower fixture and the minimalist feel to the decor.",4-Oct-13,4
"The title says it all, from check in to check out, we had a fantastic time. When we pulled up in the car Peter was very helpful, took our luggage and gave us directions to the car rental return. On returning to the hotel we were met by Erica and the check in was smooth and efficient and we were shown straight to our room. The bell hop that showed us to our room was very efficient showing us fire escapes how everything worked in the room and offered to get ice for us. The staff in the club room were very friendly and welcoming, in particular Jimmy and Dave who likes to wave. The views from the club room are amazing. When I return to San Francisco I will certainly stay here again",3-Oct-13,5
"I stayed here 1 night (Sept 30) for work. The hotel was in a great location - walking distance to all of the high end shopping. There is a Starbucks right across the street. The rooms are all newly upgraded with an Asian simplistic feel to them. Loved the Grohe shower fixture. The room was super clean and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. The room was also very quiet. My only issue is that my TV would not turn on, and I could not connect to the WiFi in the room - but I checked in so late and checked out so early I didn't have time to raise the issue with the front desk.",3-Oct-13,5
The hotel is situated in Union Square so a great location if you like to shop and it is within easy access of the cable cars. The staff were friendly and helpful and our room was clean. There was free Wi-Fi which is always a plus so overall we had a fairly good stay.Our stay was marred slightly by the fact that the room was a little noisy as there was a gap between our windows/doors so we heard the external traffic (though to be fair we didn't bother trying to address this). Also we were located fairly close to the ice machine so heard that on a fairly regular basis which can be a little annoying. I personally don't like a bath/shower set up so didn't particularly like that and the water pressure definitely could be better.If location is important then this is a good option and worth consideration.,2-Oct-13,4
"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in September and really liked it. The hotel has a great location. It is right in the middle of Union Square, which is a main shopping area. Macys is one block down and the Westfield shopping centre (Old Navy, Levis, Abercrombie and Fitch etc) is only two blocks down, so really quick to walk to. The hotel reception is nice â€“ it has got a large lounge area with fireplaces and comfy chairs. When you walk in, there are quite a few staff members around with laptops that can check you in, rather than the usual check in desk. We arrived at about 4pm and were checked in straight away with no queue. We asked if we could have a room with a city view which they gave us. The room was on the 31st floor, and the views over the city were great! We were also high enough up that we couldnâ€™t hear too much street noise. There is some construction work going on down the street near Macys, but we couldnâ€™t hear this from the room. The room was quite large, with twin beds which were both really comfy with nice squashy pillows. We also had a flat screen HD tv with lots of channels. There is a safe in the room and tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom is quite big, but as other reviewers have said, the bathroom door is just a sliding door with no lock. The shower was over the bath, but the water was hot and the pressure was good for every shower, so no complaints there! The sink is a quite long and shallow, so the water from the tap does tend to splash back if you turn the tap on too hard, but we soon got the hang of it! The best bit about the room is the floor to ceiling windows that look out over the city. The view is amazing, and the windows had curtains and automatic black out window blinds, that could be closed and opened at the touch of a button. The blinds were great at keeping out light so both me and my husband slept well. There is a little coffee bar downstairs in the lobby that sells tea, coffee, bagels and other breakfast things. We had two bagels with cream cheese and two teas and it came to just over $10 so it wasnâ€™t expensive by hotel standards. It opens at 5.30am so handy if you wake up with jet lag! The only thing we didnâ€™t like about the hotel were the lifts. They were a bit clanky, and one day it sounded like something broke off and smashed into the top of the lift! We jumped out on the 23rd floor and walked up the stairs for the rest of that journey! Another guest reported it to reception, and the lift was closed off for the rest of our trip so we didnâ€™t have to risk it again! The views from the 36th floor are amazing â€“ you can see over the bay so it is definitely worth a trip up there if you get time. We didnâ€™t walk up to Fishermans Wharf, but we did take the cable car which you can pick up from just past Old Navy, near the Westfield shopping centre. We used the Powell â€“ Mason line, which was $6 per person per ride. It took about half an hour to get from Union Square to Fishermans Wharf on the cable car, and the views are amazing as you come down the hill towards the bay. We had a great omelette for breakfast at Mamas on Washington Square, but we got there at 8 when it opened, and had to queue for half an hour to get in! The best place for breakfast was a place called Sears Fine Food, which is just round the corner from the Grand Hyatt on Powell Street. We had their signature pancakes, which were delicious, but the service was just amazing! Our waitress was so friendly and professional, and they even give you a good luck token when you leave. I would definitely stay in this hotel again. All the staff we met were really friendly and helpful, the location is great, the beds are comfy and the views are amazing. I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Grand Hyatt for getting our honeymoon off to a great start!",2-Oct-13,4
"This is some hotel!! It's beautiful and has amazing views from some of its rooms of San Francisco. It really is amazing!! The room was a little small but had everything. They even have a list in the rooms of toiletries that you can have if you've forgotten anything (the usual in a good hotel) and things that you can borrow! We borrowed a kettle, there's nothing nicer than a mug of tea in the morning and that's rare in the US!!? The location is fantastic, it's right in Union Square. The only down side was the parking!! Valet is $55 + tax per night and self parking is $39 + tax, a bit steep even by SF car parks!! But apart from that, this hotel is excellent, we'd stay here again!! I highly recommend it!! ",1-Oct-13,5
"The location of this Hotel is great on top of Union Square. If you get a high floor( there are 32 floors), the views are great. In fact, we slept with our blinds open to enjoy the view. The room is a fair size, but the bathroom is poor. The sink is very shallow and makes brushing your teeth and shaving difficult. I do not understand how this basic design fault was approved as this Hotel was refurbished in the last few months. Also, the shower pressure was rubbish and the bath was tiny and uncomfortable.There was no kettle for tea. I had to insist to get one. I stayed for 5 days and on one day, the room service wanted to charge $4 for a small jug of hot milk & argued with me, when I said , since it was small, I was given free on other days. There is a small fridge but no mini bar and this fridge remains empty. Bizarre.This Hotel is quite pricey and the level of service does not match.",1-Oct-13,4
This hotel was fabulous right in the centre of Union square. Our room looked right out onto Macys and Union Square. The staff couldn't do enough for you I would recommend this hotel as you won't be disappointed.,30-Sep-13,5
"Hotel is less than 5 minutes walking distance from Bart/Muni subway stations (both Powell and Union Square) that will take you to/from SFO International Airport. Hotel rooms are spacious and clean. Free WIFI available for guests and Fitness room at top floor of the hotel with beautiful city views is open 24 hours. Lots of retail shops, restaurants & convenient stores outside the hotel. Very safe location and accessible by foot to most major tourist attractions. We stay at Hyatt Properties locally and abroad wherever Hyatt Hotel is available and hotel staff's customer service is consistently excellent. Highly recommended for all travelers.",30-Sep-13,5
"Stayed here on a business trip, and thanks to my employer's relationship with the hotel, was comped breakfast (like a $25 value). The breakfast buffet was very nice.Room was clean and modern and had a nice view of the city. Room service was great, though they forgot my dessert but promptly brought it up. Very comfortable stay, nice bed, great bathroom.The lobby was undergoing extensive construction which made coming/going a little confusing, but it was bearable.Would definitely stay here again.",29-Sep-13,5
"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights and we are wondering if this is truly part of the Hyatt chain. Whatever they are doing to train the staff, they need to spread the word to the other Hyatt properties, where we never get this kind of experience. The staff at this Hyatt property is really quite excellent and they all consistently have a habit of going the extra mile. This place is obviously very well managed and this hotel's manager should go out there and train all the other properties to be this good. The hotel was recently renovated top-to-bottom, so it just adds to the very positive experience.",29-Sep-13,5
"Modern hotel with friendly staff. In the past, I usually stayed at the Hilton when going to a conference in San Francisco. I was very glad I stayed at this hotel in the recent trip. The room is more modern and the price is much better. The Hilton is just too big and checking in could take a long time during a conference. I don't eat big breakfast so the Starbucks coffee across the street is convenient.",28-Sep-13,5
I stayed 2 nights at this fabulous property a few months ago. The revamp the property doesn't go unnoticed. The finishes are all rounded off beautifully. The room was extremely comfortable & I loved all the modern amenities. What you truly can't beat is the location! Literally a stones grow away from Union Square. The prices are extremely reasonable for what you get. Absolutely excellent! Can't wait to be back!,28-Sep-13,5
"The hotel is about a minute away from Union Square and the surrounding streets are pretty flat for San Francisco. Great views of the city from our room, especially watching the fog rolling in. Checking in was very quick and staff were friendly. We had an issue on our first night with noisy neighbours at 3am (not great after a 10hr flight), however one call to reception and this was sorted out within 5 minutes. Would definitely stay here again.",28-Sep-13,5
"Visited in September 2013 for three days. Checking in was ok but only 2 of the four reception desks were open and we had to wait 20 mins as 'guests' asked for local information .... What's wrong with the concierge desk? The room was excellent, very comfortable and included a fridge for our own use. We were on the 6 th floor so didn't have a view but did venture to the top floor as advised by others. However, the top floor is no longer a bar but a venue for private functions as per the notices. Again however, we ignored the notices and ventured in and I think as long as you stay out of people's way it's fine and very much worth it - the view is stunning. We did not eat or drink in the hotel as we wanted to sight see as much as possible.Alcatraz is a must but you must book at least two weeks before (10 bucks from the hotel to pier 39 by taxi) and we can highly recommend the open top Big Bus city tour. Reduced rate tickets available from the concierge desk and the nearest stop is 300m from the hotel by Macy's.Overall, a very good hotel and would definitely recommend it.",26-Sep-13,4
"The hotel is in a great location. Within walking distance to Chinatown. The concierge was very helpful. He gave us a sheet for restaurant options when we wasnt sure where we wanted to go. He even had stamps for our postcards to send out! The restaurant there was ok (we had breakfast). A little pricey, but the food was good. The room was clean and decent. Would defintiely stay here again.",26-Sep-13,5
"Well the hotel is perfect, excaxtly what you expect from the grand Hyatt. But it think they should offer free parking with a 250$ room!!! We had to pay 35$ for a nearby parking over night. Other than that the location is perfect and the stuff really helpful.",26-Sep-13,5
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt. The staff is friendly and helpful with whatever you need. The city, is obviously amazing and a definite must for anyone looking to explore. Our room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, the pillows on the bed were too flat for us. We will probably try a different place when we return, but by no fault of the Hyatt.",24-Sep-13,4
"Stayed here for a short visit sadly only 4 nights, we will definitely return.The Hyatt is a good location central to all sights etc.The staff are all very helpful and professional, nothing's too much trouble.Rooms are a good size and very clean. The beds are very comfortable with a choice of feather or foam pillows and bed linen is a nice quality.The restaurant is very nice, good quality food and service.Most importantly all rooms had complimentary wifi.I would recommend this hotel and will definitely use in future.San Francisco's a great place to visit very diverse and colourful.",22-Sep-13,5
"The roof bar, restaurant really is what this hotel is all about. The rooms are a bit long in the tooth but the view from up top are absolutely outstanding. I love San Francisco and this is a hotel which has many rooms with a view,",21-Sep-13,4
"We were at the Hyatt a couple of days ago. It is a great location, the rooms are not big but ok. The only problem we had was the room was boiling during the day if its sunny. The sunshine was fighting the air con. No matter how high you turned the air con on it was very hot. Other than that, I needed a jacket cleaned with in the day and they collected it 9pm on the night we arrived and it was back in the cupboard when we came home late the next afternoon, and for $11 so not a rip off either. Breakfast in the restaurant is actually very good but the restaraunt is very small, so unless you are up early there was a queue, it's a very big hotel but very small restaurant for breakfast. The gym is very good, but gets very busy, by 8.30 all of the machines were being used, so get up really early or leave the gym until later in the day.",20-Sep-13,4
"Large hotels in cities always have certain touch of being slightly impersonal. We were pleasantly surprised at the Grand Hyatt as all the staff we encountered were friendly, pleasant and very helpful. Maybe because we were Brits visiting! We had a large comfortable room with all amenities, although spent very little time in it. San Francisco is a really great city.",19-Sep-13,4
"We have stayed in different Hyatt hotels numerous times, all over USA. In the past, we usually had a positive experience, thatâ€™s why before going to new place, we always checked Hyatt first. This time it was frustrating and disappointing experience. We checked in on September 6th, 11 am. My husband called twice and asked for early check in. When we arrived at the hotel, my husband asked for bayview room and was told there werenâ€™t any available. Later, he was told that there was one room which will be ready shortly. So apparently, there was a bayview room. We agreed to wait. We left the property for sightseeing when the receptionist called us at 11:40 stating that the room was ready. We hustled back to the hotel, at the reception we were told they called us by mistake. Well, we went back to sightseeing plans. My husband called the hotel at 3:30, and was told that room will be available late after 4 since the previous customer had 4 pm check out. That was never mentioned to us before. Well, we went more sightseeing and came back to the hotel to check into the room at 9pm. I guess, it was enough time to check that everything is working in the room. When we got to the room, apparently none of the electrical switches worked. Shade wouldnâ€™t open or close, lights would turn on/off only manually. We called front desk. 2 engineers came numerous times with ladders and tools and were not able to fix the problems. So after a long day of sightseeing we still were not able to rest. After our 9 years old son fell asleep, they called us from the front desk stating that if we want the working room we will have to move. It was after 10pm. Exhausted, with a sleeping boy, we moved to another bayview room. Apparently there were few of bayview room available, even though we were told there was none. The story just began, since none of the electrical switches worked in the new room either! In the morning, shade wouldnâ€™t open, so we called front desk again. One more engineer came who couldnâ€™t fix it. I called front desk again and was transferred to 3 different people, each of them called himself manager and asked me what my problem was. So I had to tell everything over again for 3 times! Did they make a fun of me? Eventually I got disconnected. I called again and told the 4th person that we are not going to pay for this night. Only after that, this girl Jessica called (God bless her), and said she will take care of everything. We left the hotel after 12 pm, the shade in our room was still shut, so we couldnâ€™t see the bay view anyway. We are loyal customers and understand that technical problems can happen, however, this is not the way this situation shouldâ€™ve been handled by hotel class like Hyatt. Hotel staff left a bottle of wine and 2 cookies in our room, which I donâ€™t feel could compensate us for all the inconveniences. I strongly feel that we shouldâ€™ve been offered full or at least partial credit for the first night, since we didnâ€™t enjoy a single bit of it, and were not able to see the light in the morning, which was quiet depressing. During check out, my husband mentioned our traumatic experience and after telling the whole story (again!!) was offered Hyatt points. This is generous but doesnâ€™t satisfy us. This requires us to stay in Hyatt hotel again, however, after such experience we will most likely stay away from Hyatt for a while. By the way, breakfast in the club is till 10:00, however, there is nothing left by 9:50, so hurry! Also, they wouldn't clean up your table if you don't tip them in advance.If you are lucky, and everything works in your room, you could still enjoy.",19-Sep-13,2
"As a Hyatt diamond member I tend to stay at quite a few of their properties and this is one I'd recommend you take a pass on... The list of their shortcomings during my stay (and I'm only halfway through it) would be tedious to review but the short of it is: however well intentioned, ill trained staff and poor management don't make for quality hospitality. Add to that a poorly conceived property and you have the right mix for an awful experience.",16-Sep-13,2
"This hotel was so good. Perfect location. right next to Union Square, rooms were clean comfortable, faultless. We had a meal in the restaurant on our first night which was very good, maybe a bit on the expensive side, but service and food was very good. If there was anything I could say needs a bit more improvement with,it would be the concierge. We were trying to ask the lady some questions, but she was answering us, having a conversation with someone else behind the desk, and then answering the phone. we were a bit frustrated and felt like we were more a nuisance than anything else. Before writing this review, I read someones elses, and it appears we weren't the only ones that had the experience. Bit disappointing as other than this department, this hotel for us couldn't have been a better choice and would definitely recommend. We will hopefully be back to visit SF which we loved, and we will definitely stay here again. We stayed at the Hyatt in Vancouver a couple of weeks after the SF Hyatt........SF is WAY way far superior in service in comparison.",16-Sep-13,4
"I don't really know how I feel about this hotel so I will pin point the good things and some of the things I found disappointing..Check in was fast and friendly, we arrived, after a long haul flight, at 11.30am, and were given a room straight away on the 32nd floor (we paid extra for a room on the 32nd+ floor with access to the Executive Lounge). We were very grateful and it was a good start. The first thing that hit me walking into the room was the noise - it was deafening. On closer inspection the door to a tiny balcony, which I suppose at one point used to open, would not close properly and the wind whipped into the room constantly. The hotel doesn't appear to have double-glazing and the noise from Union Square was unbelievable. Still, the room was a decent size and very modern. The bathroom was amazing - the shower was huge (and a waste of space? How many people do you want to fit into a shower? I'd say a family of 6 would have fitted quite comfortably!).It's in a good location. The One Up Bar was a nice place for an afternoon drink. We didn't try the restaurant.The Exec Lounge offered us a buffet breakfast (good) and access all day. In the evenings from 5pm to 9pm we were offered snacks and drinks ($3 for a beer, $4 for a wine and free soft drinks) and that was good value. I am glad we upgraded so we had access to this. David and Jimmy were delightful! Their customer service was amazing and they were very friendly and knowledgeable. There was a computer and printer for guests to use, very handy, as we needed it to print out tickets to the baseball. The hotel also has free wi-fi in your room and all over the hotel - a plus.I found the concierge okay, not very knowledgeable at all - seemed a bit like our questions were an inconvenience. One day we were leaving for the day through the front doors and one of the staff closed the heavy glass door on my husband, hitting him in the head and nearly knocking him out. No one was concerned and the employee just smiled. My husband had to sit down for a while to get his bearings.House keeping were lovely, very pleasant - we left them a tip every day and one day returned to a lovely note thanking us for the tip/s and wishing us a lovely day. I thought that was a lovely touch!I have to say the bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillows were fabulous!In all I guess I'd say it was average. There were some great things about the hotel - location being one of them. Some of the staff were great, others seemed to be just ""doing a job"". The noise from the wind and the street was terrible. I probably wouldn't stay here again. Double- glaze the rooms and I might consider it.",15-Sep-13,3
"Stayed 4 x nights over ""labour-day"" weekend on first visit to San Francisco. Hotel is in great location and we were given high floor city view king room as per request. Good city views - room large and comfortable, all conveniences as you'd expect. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, giving advice on local transport etc. Overlooking Union Square you are right in the heart of downtown SF, good shops, cafes and eating out close by, as well as minutes walk into Chinatown and Cable Car and city-tour bus stops just on the square etc. Good base from which to explore the city - can walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Would highly recommend for location, attentive staff and accommodation standard. Roof-top gym (if so inclined) gives great city views. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning - very good, and also had breakfast on-the-go from the lobby. Bar is nice area to have a drink although there are lots of places to go in the surrounding area. Would definitely consider staying here again if/when return to San Francisco.",15-Sep-13,4
Location is great. Rooms were wonderful and the floor to ceiling windows gave a great view of the city. Grand club lounge on the 32 floor was a great place too start on a wonderful evening. Doorman was great at arranging car service to airport and got us a super driver.,12-Sep-13,5
"I stayed here four nights on my first trip to San Fran. The room was clean and comfortable. I paid extra for the City View room so I was higher up and the street noise was less. Loved the floor to ceiling windows. Location was perfect. I took one of the tours offered through the concierge. For a first time visitor, it was a great tour as I got a feel of the town. The hotel is next to the Muni so you can visit other parts of the city easily. Lots of great restaurants nearby. Breakfast at OneUp was a perfect start to the day and worth the extra money. Met some nice people at the happy hour there too. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip.",10-Sep-13,4
Excellent hotel friendly and helpful staff .I was in a tenth floor room overlooking Union Sq. Beautiful room spacious clean with all facilities required . Large floor to ceiling window gave a fabulous view over this wonderful city . Not cheap but worth it every penny. One small issue is lack of a retail outlet for essentials . However staff will try there best to assist .,8-Sep-13,4
"It certainly has location going for it! Very convenient to doing the touristy things inSF. But unfortunately, many of the staff know this and believe they can throw customer service out the window into union square. Our encounters were mainly with the front desk and bell desk the two times we stayed",8-Sep-13,3
"We stayed here for 3 nights as our first stop in California. We don't travel light unfortunately and because we had no car during our stay in SF, all our luggage had to fit into this tiny room. Small issue if you are using this as mostly a city break to see the sights of SF. But with all our shopping and baggage, we could barely see the carpets on the floor by the end of our stay! The lighting in the bathroom is super amazing for applying makeup. Big plus for me:)Location is definitely unbeatable. You are steps away from Union Square and there is a cable car stop just round the block. There are tons of shopping nearby at Market Street and Geary and Post. Starbucks is just across the street so no problems with breakfast & coffees. All round reliable option as a base in the city.",8-Sep-13,3
"I love the location of this Hyatt. Very nice room, quiet, clean & spacious. The lobby was being renovated, so Front Desk was in a temporary location. The Front Desk staff handled the flow of guests very well. Very courteous and accommodating.The Stay Fit gym was bigger than most Hyatt's I visit, which was awesome. I didn't visit any of the Food & Beverage outlets, so no comment here.Again, if you love to shop, this is the place. I will recommend to family & friends.",8-Sep-13,4
"Our trip started with 3 nights in San Francisco and we choose this hotel because of the location just close to Union Square. The Grand Hyatt was renovated and the entrance was nice. The staff at the front desk (especially Olivia) was super friendly and helpfull. We got a room on the 30th floor. Room was clean, good and the most important quiet during the night. The hotel has free wifi and it works good in the room too. We had inroom dining and the food was good including the service.We would definitely stay here again!!",6-Sep-13,4
"Excellent experience at the Grand Hyatt! It is located in the heart of Union Square, next to multiple shops and restaurants. I was able to walk to Chinatown, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf, Coit Tower, the Ferry building and took a taxi to Hayes Valley in the evening to watch the symphony. The hotel does have it's own coffee shop, but right outside the door is also a Starbucks. The lobby has a very modern and open feel with a friendly staff readily available to help with any questions. The food onsite is good. My conference experience was good. The room was very nice and comfortable. I stayed on a higher floor with a great view. Internet was provided and there is 24 hour fitness. When I go back, I will be staying at the Grand Hyatt!",6-Sep-13,5
"We spent 4 nights at the Hyatt for Labor Day weekend. Our family had 3 rooms. The front desk was very accommodating in making sure that 2 rooms were connecting and the 3rd room was nearby on the same floor. The concierge (Mark) was awesome! All of his dinner recommendations were a huge hit - including the trip to the food truck park at Fort Mason. Great creative ideas! Mark also gave us advice on when to walk, cab vs. drive ourselves. His maps were perfect. The rooms were clean and we especially appreciated the water refill stations next to the ice machine. We will be back!",5-Sep-13,5
"My one and only night ever in San Francisco and yikes! This hotel took over 2 hours to check me in. Stood on line for at least 30 minutes. The room was average, the breakfast was a cattle feed line of yuc... After a night here I was grateful to get on a jet outa here...",4-Sep-13,2
"During our visit last weekend we were given a room on the 20th floor overlooking Union Square. Great room, bed and linens were very nice and everything is very modern. Free WiFi with a good connection in the room. One of the best features was being able to raise and lower the window shade remotely while in bed. They moved the bar and restaurant from the 36th floor to the 2nd. The new location is very nice although we wanted to see the view from the top floor which is now being used as an event venue. We asked the front desk if we could be allowed up to the 36th floor and were escorted up by a security person who allowed us to take some photos. All staff was very accommodating from the moment we checked in. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. We wouldnâ€™t hesitate to stay there again.",4-Sep-13,5
"In the center of SFO and near Union Square. The clercks were very friendly, the Room is clean, modern and confortable. The location is perfect if you don't want to drive because is near of Market Street with a main store for your shop.",4-Sep-13,5
"checking in to the hyatt, the front desk felt a little weird to me. maybe it was a more modern way of checking in? the lobby was nice and warm and we got in just in time for a free wine tasting at the lobby! we had a weird experience while have breakfast at the restaurant, one up. The glasses for juice they gave us were very small. it was like a 3 ounce glass (they we're using the same glasses for shots at the lounge.) and then when we asked for water, the server only filled our glasses halfway for some reason, all 4 of us. we werent upset or anything, just found it all unusual. overall though, the rooms were nice, the location was good and right in the middle of everything. the food, decent and standard for a hyatt hotel.",3-Sep-13,4
"The Grand Hyatt is truly a Grand Hotel on its own. They won't call it GRAND for nothing. From the reception area to the elevator and then to your room, you're greeted by the employees with their great smiles. The view on my room was superb. Facing the Union Square and it is really wonderful view especially at night time when you see all the lights on the buildings nearby. Overall, I give 10 Stars to Grand Hyatt for their location, service and great customer service. I had to mention about their valet parking... It is a compliment since one of the valet driver was so kind that he helped us to rotate the steering wheel since we couldn't get it to move. Thank you so much Mr. Valet Driver for helping us out!!! It was late at night when we checked in, but thank you for making us feel comfortable in the area and for your kindness in helping us out. You guys are the best! Also, the lady who gave the directions on where to go, local attractions, etc was also nice and very helpful. She takes time in telling you where you need to go and what street to take. Good job everyone. Please keep up the good work!!! ",3-Sep-13,5
"I periodically have to stay in San Francisco and always choose the Grand Hyatt Union Square. The renovations turned out great, the club is well run and service is great? I would love to have windows that open as I prefer fresh air to air conditioning",3-Sep-13,5
"It is nice to see the improvements continue at that Grand Hyatt Union Square, but I really really miss the breakfast and cocktails on the top floor. It is no longer open to the public and only used for convention space.The restaurant and bar on the mezzanine level is ok, but just not the same as it was on the top floor. Not likely I'll stay here as I just loved taking in the views from up there.",3-Sep-13,4
"I stayed at this hotel in July of this year. This hotel is in the middle of union square near all the shops and restaurants and is near all the major transit lines. If you like a nice stroll, you can walk to the Embarcadero. The bus stop to Chinatown is right across the street. Our room was a little small but very comfortable and clean. Because our room was on the 21st floor, we had panoramic views of the city and bay. Their breakfast is a little expensive but very delicious; I recommend it for anyone staying at this hotel.",1-Sep-13,4
"Stayed for a conference in the hotel 5 nights. Asked for a high floor room upon reservation and at check-in. Was put on 10th floor with a view of...nothing. I thought it might have been because of the conference rate, but others at the conference had great rooms. A little disappointed. Room was also next to elevator shaft.Rooms were clean and well appointed. Small as expected in a big city.Location was excellent, near restaurants, shopping and transportation.Not sure what the doormen are supposed to do, because they didn't do much. They seemed more interested in chatting with eachother than opening the door for my wife.",31-Aug-13,4
"It is placed at Union Square, near lots of magazines and the Moscone Convention Center. The restaurant is undersized for the number of rooms, and frequently we had to wait to be seated for breakfast. The employees are very attentive.",31-Aug-13,4
"After a week of college tours mixed with hiking in the great outdoors we were ready for some luxury, hotel service and good food. The location for the Grand Hyatt is perfect for seeing Chinatown, The Cable Car Museum, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, great shopping, and restaurants of all types. I would describe our rooms and the overall vibe in the hotel as urban elegance - cool, hip but not overstated. The gym is huge with gorgeous views of the City. The highlights of our stay were the concierge desk - everyone was helpful, knowledgeable and one concierge offers a free coffee walk around the block to share what she knows about the area. I did the coffee walk and found the info and anecdotes interesting and her enthusiasm entertaining. The other highlight is the lounge access. The view alone is worth the extra fee but the breakfast and appetizers (tuna roll, tamales) were great too. My teens loved it and felt save venturing out on their own in the area. My husband and I loved the close proximity to everything we wanted to do and see.DISCLOSURE: I publish TravelingMom.com and the cost of the room and lounge access were provided to me as part of a press package, however, the opinions are my own.",31-Aug-13,5
"Had everything that we needed. Rooms were clean and well maintained. Location near the shops, but a long way from Fisherman's Wharf area (further than we thought from the maps) and cabs were relatively expensive. We had no problems with this hotel at all.",31-Aug-13,4
"I was walked from the Hyatt Regency San Francisco to the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, and I wish I would have staied longer, because the service was 5 stars. They ensured I had a quiet room, with a king sized bed (which was unnecessary), and I had probably the best view of my life of San Francisco. The concierge was very helpful, he tried to ensure I could stay there the remainder of my stay, even though it was not possible, and he managed to get me tickets to Alcatraz, which is a very difficult thing for a tourist.I would defitinely come back to this property. The Hyatt Grand San Francisco lives up to the Hyatt mission of providing authentic hospitality!",30-Aug-13,5
"Stayed four nights on a business trip. Staff reasonably helpful at checkin and checkout, breakfast and bar staff very pleasant and happy to help. Not the quietest of spots and traffic noise fairly noticeable on the 11th floor. Rooms clean and well maintained. Not cheap but also a nice place to stay.",29-Aug-13,4
"Nice hotel, excellent view! We had a balcony room with a view of the bay. Really nice. The location was great, we walked up and down the piers all day stopping in for a bite here or a drink there. Lots to see including the America's cup, way cool! The service was very good, exceptional even. I'd definatly stay there again.",29-Aug-13,4
"This was my second stay at this Hyatt and it was first rate. The rooms have been newly renovated and have a slick, modern almost Scandinavian feel with light woods and earth tones. The hotel staff tries very hard to make each guest feel special. I had a King room on a high floor with a great view of downtown as well as water views of the Bay between buildings. Lovely, especially at night. As a frequent guest, I had access to the Club room and it was a very nice perk, offering breakfast and evening appetizers/drinks. Most rooms now feature a walk-in shower. If you need a tub, be sure to ask specifically for a room so equipped. The location just one block from Union Square is perfect for work or pleasure. The cable car on Powell is just 2 blocks and the BART & MUNI are just 3 blocks away on Market. Ask for a high floor for the best views.",27-Aug-13,5
"We are a family of four, with two boys, ages 10 and 12. We stayed at the hotel on 8/21- 8/24The hotel is in a great location. Although, while not the quietest of areas (Union Square and after all, SF is a big city) our room (2102) was quiet and well appointed.The staff was very attentive and made you feel welcome.The hotel has gone through a complete renovation so our room seemed brand new. Cool looking room, with electric shades, cool lighting and furniture. My kids liked the fact that you didn't need to slide your key into the lock to open it..just needed to put your key card next to the ""plate"" on the door. The bathroom is stylish with a great sink. One strange item though - the door to the bathroom is a sliding, frosted glass door - but does not have a lock!!??. This was OK for us since our kids are older but if you are traveling with younger kids, believe me, a lock is desired (or maybe we aren't that hip or we couldn't figure out how to lock the door - probably both!)The lobby is sleek and the registration desk is unlike most hotels - it's more like a ""registration area"" where the staff have cool tables with their laptops and use those to check you in. Also, in the AM, the lobby has a section where they serve coffee, pastries and fruit and is a nice added feature (they charge for this but there is a coffee maker in the room, if desired) Also, there is a Starbucks directly across the street - one of 483 in the surrounding blocks!! Being by Union Square, many choices for food and shopping. Our bellman told us of a Walgreens in the Marriott a block away which had a decent grocery section so we got some snacks etc there to store in small in-room fridge. One other nice feature - directly next to the ice machine was a filtered water dispenser (like a Poland Spring water cooler). Nice!Room was a bit small but the beds (two full size not queens) were very comfortable.All in all, great place to stay in the city for a few days.",25-Aug-13,4
"Arrived late to hotel, service at the desk was great! Rooms were clean. Hotel service was prompt amd delicious! Hotel restaurant food was excellent.. Location prime for sight seeing!! Would def go again!",25-Aug-13,5
This hotel was excellent. The renovated hotel is completely different than before. They did an excellent job upgrading all the facilities. The new guest rooms are elegant and functional. This truly is a 5 star hotel.,23-Aug-13,5
"It's 4:30 a.m. and I am wide awake. The AC fan in my room is so loud it woke me up. I was so exhausted last night, I guess I didn't hear it. Although I'm on the 14th floor, the street noises are also very loud. And the large gap under the door lets in a lot of light and noise. If you're not a light sleeper, this hotel will be a great choice for you. It's modern, clean and well located. ",23-Aug-13,4
"Stayed at Grand Hyatt San Francisco for two nights in July as part of a family vacation. Itâ€™s great hotel and fantastic location. Albeit a bit expensive, it is still worth it. Diamond-status recognized almost to my full satisfaction. Had asked for a suite upgrade but due to check-in tried their best to secure a good room (high floor, etc). I travel around 140 nights per year, and really likes when a hotel treats you well when you come with the family which is THE most critical time. Three things that made our stay really pleasant were: 1) I received excellent service and information from the Concierge (I recall the name of Joanna Husk or something like that). Advised on excellent steak-places, golden gate view points, etc 2) the Club Lounge is really nice â€“ in particular the breakfast is with lotâ€™s of healthy choices (dairy, fruits, etc), the food is presented well/â€ùappetizingâ€ù, and overall the lounge is kept clean, itâ€™s reasonably quiet and with a good view 3) the restaurant and bar on the first floor provides excellent food and service. Overall a great stay. Our kids (aged 10 and 15) loved it. Suggest that the self-parking information is a bit more detailed, (e.g. with a photo showing where to enter the self-parking which is around the corner, just across the street) since I had to circle the block twice to be sure I got in at the right place.",23-Aug-13,4
"a brilliant place to base yourself to access the shops, the sights, the cable car, market st - everything really. We ate in resturant one night and was impressed, Breakfast was also great, especially the fried potatoes. Would recommed staying here",22-Aug-13,5
We are a family of five with three teenagers.We arrived late and were brilliantly looked after by Betsy on reception. She even gave a recommendation of Lori's Diner around the corner for a great late night meal.The rooms are freshly and stylishly renovated with great views of the city. Easy to make your way from here around town.The concierge service was brilliant with Elaine and Liz helping us arrange trips to Muirs Wood and to watch the Oakland A's baseball. Our apologies to A's fan Liz for jinxing her team to a loss against the lowly Houston Astros.The restaurant is small for the hotel which can cause some delays at breakfast time. Not a problem for those of us on holidays but it could be for anyone with a busy schedule. Food is good though and the bar is a pleasant place with live acoustic music in the evening.The hotel even provided a limo to get us to the airport for the same price as a minivan.Thanks for great stay. We are happy to recommend the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco.,22-Aug-13,5
"This was a very modern hotel where everything worked like clockwork. The Staff were very good. The concierge desk staff were brilliant. The location is great for tours and the cable cars. The restaurant was lovely, good food, good service but not expensive.The room was good, clean and modern. We would stay there again.",21-Aug-13,5
"OMG what a beautiful hotel , the view its amazing i was on the 31 floor , you can see the city and the fog in the moring, service is very good the, location , location , location , worth the price! the hotel is next to union square from there you walk to Chinatown, market place is just 4 blocks away",21-Aug-13,5
"We stayed here for 3 nights on the first part of our honeymoon. The location is great - right in the heart of Union Square. The hotel was clean and modern and the staff were great. The only thing I never liked was the breakfast buffet - it was a bit of a rip off. Otherwise, all in all this is a good choice for San Fran.",21-Aug-13,4
"This is my first vacation in San Francisco and decided to stay at Grand Hyatt because of its high reputation. There are both pros and cons during my stay, which I will pin point in detail. First off, I really like the location. The accessibility to Union Square and ChinaTown are within reach. Secondly, the concierge here are absolutely amazing ! One of the concierge named Joanna is half Thai, so she gave me insurmountable information about San Francisco's main attractions as well as recommended us delicious restaurants.Moving on to the room, we're in 27th Floor and the room we have had a great view of the Bay. Also with high technology TV programs, it makes Grand Hyatt more attractive to the people in this generation. Now moving on to the cons. Firstly, there are no mini-bar inside the refrigerator. I found this strange because how can a great hotel as Hyatt do not have mini-bar in it ? I just don't understand.Secondly and this is the only thing that I REALLY REALLY HATE on this stay. The breakfast and its service. I have been traveling around the world and never ever been disappointed with breakfast as this hotel before. Before complaining, I have to say that it's my fault to book Bed and Breakfast package at this hotel. We thought that the breakfast is gonna be good but things turned opposite.  Now, we actually had buffet as breakfast, not a la carte one. There are not as many breakfast selections and the dining area is small compare to Hyatt Regency Orange County in Los Angeles that I've been before staying at this place. Furthermore, the food here taste horrible that I can only eat just Yogurt and berries ( that's the only thing that was great ). The scrambled eggs were too dry and have no taste and the pancakes were horribly made. Also, the sausage and bacon were too salty and the appearance of it looks as if it was made yesterday. Moving on to the drinks, there are limited choice of juices, which we only get orange juice but not apple juice or grape juice. The coffee and tea are okay but not that great. Next is the service, my younger brother was really piss at one of the waiter named Jackie. I was also frustrated with the way he talked. He didn't even say "" Good morning sir, would you like some tea or coffee ? "". Instead, he said '' You want some tea ? you want orange juice ? ''. I did order an English Breakfast tea and when he served, he spilled some out and it was on my new suede sneaker that I bought a day ago. He did not even clean and apologize. All he did was saying '' Here's your tea enjoy''. Moreover, his facial appearance didn't seem nice and also he was not that enthusiastic either. A good service-mind waiter should be alert all the time as well as remembering each customer's menu ( e.g. my younger brother is allergic to orange juice, but the waiter still serve it ( which is wasteful ). ). For other waiters are okay but not that great.The manager here seriously needs to improve the breakfast quality as well as their waiters because when I was about to checkout, I heard from others saying that they hate the breakfast here so much. Lastly, I had a great time vacationing in San Francisco but not at Grand Hyatt. Are there chance for me to stay here again ? Maybe no.",20-Aug-13,3
"Union Square and its surroundings have all the shopping your soul might want and then some more. And this Hotel is right there, everything is in walking distance, be it shops from Marshalls to Luis Vuitton, food for foodies and everybody else, Chinatown 2 blocks away and the Cable Car 1 block away to connect to Fisherman's Wharf and Giardhelli Square. If you arive with a ""smile"" and ask ""nicely"" you will be accomodated in one of the upper floors for a beautiful view of the city. The rooms have been remodelled nicely, and although for me in particular the beds are too soft, nobody else in my party complained about that! Consierge service is excellent and very helpful in suggesting restaurants, arranging for rental cars etc.",20-Aug-13,5
"So i stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and it was great the service was great the valet did a nice quick job getting our car and the check in was flawless. What i liked most about it was that it had a great location walking distance to a lot of major places like union square. The only reason i gave this 4 stars is because the rooms were a little tight and cramped with 4 people even though it had 2 double beds, but that was not that much of a problem. But otherwise everything else is fantastic.",19-Aug-13,4
"I very much enjoyed my stay at this hotel! The location is perfect in the heart of San Francisco's Union Square. It makes it very convenient to take advantage of public transportation including the famous trolley, and the many tours and hop on hop off buses. Additionally, there are many stores nearby. The rooms are beautifully appointed, and I particularly enjoyed the suite that Chris Friedemann upgraded me to as a Hyatt Diamond. He is a consummate professional with impeccable follow up!The concierge team go above and beyond, and in particular Susan advised me on many VERY helpful tips by email before my arrival, such as booking advance tickets to Alcatraz as they sell out far in advance. She also advised me about local tours and hop on hop off buses, as well as not to have a rental car based on what I wanted to see due to the high parking fees and convenience of public transportation. The club lounge was phenomenal with great views and a wonderful selection, and the staff was superb checking on the hotel guests there, and making sure everyone was comfortable and had what they needed. The check in staff and bell staff was super friendly, and I truly had a remarkable experience (which I've gotten used to and come to expect from the Hyatt brand). I highly recommend this hotel, and I will certainly be back!",19-Aug-13,5
"Adjacent to Union Square, this hotel could not be in a better place for shopping, dining, and seeing sites. The view from the room overlooking Union Square was nice although it could be noisy during events. However, the space allocation in the (recently renovated) room was awkward and walls seemed paper thin -- we could hear conversations clearly from adjacent two rooms. Room doors could stand to be adjusted to prevent slamming when guests choose to let them self-close which became especially bothersome in early morning or late at night. Front of house staff seemed unconcerned when these items were mentioned, even remarking that the noise issue has been raised before; no compensation offered. As such, I elected to stay at the Hyatt Embarcadero upon my return the following week; there are plenty of other Union Square hotels to choose from.",19-Aug-13,3
"We stayed here over the 4th of July weekend and even though it was very busy the service was very good. The room was a good size, with a great view and a very comfortable bed. The only hitch was that we had requested a cot and there was a bit of a mix up where it was delivered to the room and not set up. When we requested that the cot be set up, they actually removed it instead. After explaining what had happened, the night manager personally brought the cot back up, set it up himself and offered us a complimentary breakfast for our trouble. He really went above and beyond and made our stay a good one. Thanks.",18-Aug-13,4
"Grand Hyatt is pricely but a good value because of its great location - two blocks from Chinatown - one block from the cable car stop that takes you to Fisherman's Wharf and less than a block for the multiple hop-off-and hop-on tour buses that travel the city. Starbucks across the street, drugstore and laundromat within easy walking distance. Concierge most helpful in arranging tours. All price range of restaurants nearby. Hotel is beautiful and rooms were excellent, though we spent little time there.",17-Aug-13,5
"While we loved the location of the hotel and appreciated its close proximity to shopping and Sears Fine Foods for breakfast (one of our favorites!), the hotel itself was disappointing. Small rooms and odd bathroom layouts made the experience average at best. It was clean and we didn't have any issues. But for the money, you can likely do better.",17-Aug-13,3
"I like this hotel. Our room was extremely clean if small for the 3 of us; not the hotel's fault, more the fault of making arrangements through Virgin Holidays instead of directly with the hotel. Not a lot of storage space, which leads me to think this is a hotel catering more for business travellers than holiday makers, but maybe there are more spacious apartments elsewhere. No pool to the best of my knowledge, but there is a gym located on the top (35th) floor with fantastic views over the city. Our room was on the 12th floor, so we had background traffic noise, and also there is a lot of construction work going on (and they were definitely working at night); that wasn't great, so choose a room higher up and facing away from Stockton.Staff are extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. The location is central to lots of shopping, mainly high end, but more reasonable shops within walking distance. Transport of all varieties is right on the doorstep - cable cars, buses, trams and metro. A CityPASS is a handy thing to have and we've used it a lot; will get you all over the city. Chinatown is walking distance, in fact, so is Pier 39 though you have to be a more keen walker there and learn the less hilly routes. The only down side is that it's very close to the Tenderloin where many of the city's homeless have shelters, so it's a common sight to see people begging for money on street corners. I guess that's reality, but a shame.So lots to recommend this hotel. One more thing there is free WiFi available, but it can be temperamental and slow at times. But it's there, and that's also helpful. For completeness, there is also a faster WiFi but you pay for that.",15-Aug-13,4
"My husband I can spent the long 4th of July weekend at the Grand Hyatt San San Francisco. We flew in from San Diego, took a shuttle (the BART system was not working because of a strike), and headed straight to the hotel. We were able to check in quickly (under 5 minutes) and super early 11am. Check and check!We loved our king standard room on the 20th floor. Our room overlooked Union Square. The weather that weekend was impeccable with all sunny skies. The room was large compared to other comparable hotels in San Francisco (Anyone who's been to SF before knows that rooms in the city are usually crazy small). The automatic shade dark-out shade was AWESOME! The bed was low, but comfy. We didn't eat at the restaurant onsite as there are just so many options within walking distance in the area. The room was super clean and tastefully appointed. The best thing about this hotel is it's location. You can walk and shop around Union Square, which is just steps away. The walk to Chinatown was 5 minutes. While you could walk to Fisherman's Wharf (taking about an hour), we took a short cab, then caught a trolley on the way back. This hotel is pricey, but in a city like SF, you really get what you pay for. We'll be coming back.",15-Aug-13,5
"Ive stayed at this hotel about 4 or 5 times. I LOVE this hotel. The staff is fantastic, the location cant be beat, and the rooms are very 'cool' and modern. The views from the higher floors is fantastic. So awesome to see the fog roll in and out of the city. The gym is on the 35th floor. Its a great gym, and you have incredible views from the cardio machines. If you are lucky enough to have club access, the lounge on the 32nd floor is great. Honor bar and free appetizers every night. My only complaint: Dont get a room near an ice machine. It is very loud. Overall great hotel. Cant beat the location!",14-Aug-13,5
"I love everything about this hotel! The service was great, all the staff were so friendly and helpful, the rooms were spacious and clean. The location is perfect! Lots of great shooping near by. If I ever go to San Francisco again, I would definately chose Grand Hyatt again.",13-Aug-13,5
"Loved this location! The room was nicely decorated, spacious and comfortable. As hotel beds go, this one was pretty good. The fitness center had plenty of options. The hotel restaurant (One Level Up) was delicious and they offered generous pours in a glass of wine. One drawback in the room was the shower, which did not have much pressure and couldn't adjust to reach even half way across the tub. Also, while service overall was very good, the concierge staff was lacking in knowledge when I needed it and personality.",13-Aug-13,4
"I walked in without a reservation after a disappointing experience at a nearby hotel, and was instantly impressed with this property. The entire hotel has been remodeled, with a fresh, hip vibe in the lobby, and clean rooms with a similarly swanky feel. Little touches like leather-wrapped handles on the closet and electric window shades give the room a feeling of luxury that some of the city's top hotels would have a hard time matching. Desk staff was very friendly, offered lots of details about the hotel's remodel, and was quick to send up bottled water to the room. Excellent stay, will be back the next time I'm in the city.",12-Aug-13,5
"Warm reception (though unusual front desk set up - free standing oddly shaped tables), clean, modern rooms. Very accommodating to our request for connecting rooms as we were traveling with children. Great restaurant - friendly, efficient and professional service, good food. Great location - easy walk to shopping, bars/restaurants, easy 20 min walk to piers.",12-Aug-13,4
"My wife and i wanted a room on Union Square. This was our first time at the SF Grand Hyatt, and everything from the telephone booking to checkout was seamless. We had a great view towards the Bay from our room on the 22nd floor..it was immaculate if a little small. The coffee corner in the lobby is a great idea for a quick breakfast - we used it at least twice! The check-in, checkout system could be made faster. Munir Salem (executive housekeeping) was a gem in helping me look for my lost BlackBerry on 6 April, after I had checked out of the room. I still don't know how and where the phone was found, but Munir managed to find it, and Hyatt couriered it back to me in Singapore a week later. Many many thanks!",10-Aug-13,5
The rooms have been refurbished and they are all new. The beds are very comfortable.The view from the lounge situated on the top floor was amazing. There was a vista at every window.The lounge was well stocked and cozy and the staff was very helpful. Overall a great place to stay in San Francisco!,9-Aug-13,4
"We had a nice one day stay for my wife's birthday.We had booked a Bay view, hoping to see the Bay bridge at night.When we checked in the clerk stated that none of their rooms face the Bridge,but we still would have a Bay view and not a City view.Our room was on the 20th floor. I would estimate that about 80% of the view was city buildings, 15% was sky and 5 % was of the Bay.I stated my case when we checked out. I even showed the clerk the picture of the view that I had taken on my phone. She quickly apologized and reduced the room rate to the city view.... a $50 savings.The next time we will ask for a floor higher than the 20th.",7-Aug-13,4
"Ok. Hyatt Goldpasspott reservation have messed up the reservation (AGAIN) but the hotel was great friendly clean. Super nice club staff, cleaning staff etc. the only thing what my kids really missed was a pool. Also front desk (room manager) Tiffany was friendly and very pragmatic. E",6-Aug-13,4
"Stayed in June. This was our second visit and it was as nice as last time, 2 years ago. Room still feels new and modern. Great bathroom. Lobby has been renovated and looks better than before. Great location. Food at the hotel restaurant was unexpectedly good. Also this restaurant is very spacious,nicely designed. Definitely recommended.",5-Aug-13,5
"We stayed here for a bachelorette party. We had booked a Grand Club room, but didnt specify if it was for a King or Double. About 2 days before our arrival I called to confirm that they were putting us in a double and I was told yes on the 30th floor. Upon check in we didnt end up getting a double, but rather a king and there were no appologies given. Simply told ""you just made a request we cant guarantee"" You know that would've been fine if the guy wasnt talking to me in a rude manner as if I was not quite understanding what he was saying. It was just really annoying that we were told one thing and then later told something else. As far as the hotel, it was very nice and clean. I think I would've gave it a better rating had I been happy with the customer service.",5-Aug-13,3
"Easy middle of San Francisco location, close to where we were meeting for work and great to walk around San Francisco. Helpful staff and nice lobby. Would have like to stay longer and check out the bar.Rooms were clean and nicely decorated.Only issue was the howling noise from the wind, which I understand is normal for these high-rise hotels. I had a hard time sleeping because it felt like someone was coming into my room every time the wind blew.",5-Aug-13,3
"I spent a night in a Club Room at this hotel and was impressed with the customer service in the Club. The room was clean, the bed linen high quality. A good night. The front desk staff were very accomodating, allowing me to check-in early, having arrived after an international flight. I was also able to check-out a little later the next day. This flexibility was very much appreciated.",4-Aug-13,5
"We stated for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon. It was a great experience, the staff were all superb, from a quick check in and out,bar tenders, cleaners, to the most helpful concierge Joanna! The location is perfect, and gave a great starting point to explore San Fran. It is a little noisy, but you are in the city centre of San Francisco, it's not the countryside!! We managed by accident to access the staff lifts, we got such a laugh looking at the requested staff affirmations to guests on the wall of the lift (always smile, greet guests etc)... But you know, they all were super and doing excellent customer service and extra! We got lost after coming down from the bar... Great cocktails!! It was a really busy hotel with the conference that was on, but it added to the ambiance I think. We never had breakfast there, but the coffee bar was good value and great coffee.The gym on the 35th floor is such a gem, working out over the city was cool! To finish, it was a great hotel and we will be passing the recommendation to others ",4-Aug-13,4
"Rooms were clean, small but adequate . However the bartenders were the best in The city. Phil, Boa, and Danielo! Wow , I have been around the world, but never have I had better bar service ever. What a team, Congrats to Hyatt for having such exemplary employees. ",3-Aug-13,4
"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco multiple times. The location, at Union Square is excellent. My family (My wife and I and 2 kids) stayed here, this time, for vacation. We had 2 adjacent rooms. The rooms were nice, and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The service was excellent. The concierge was very helpful and his and her recommendations for places to visit, how to get there and restaurants were accurate.I highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again",3-Aug-13,5
We were in San Fran for the last night of a great week and chose Hyatt for their reputation. We were given a 6th floor bay view room. The room was nice enough but the outdoor bar music and noise was extreme. Tried to rest for a few minutes in the afternoon and it was impossible. Would not recommend staying in any bay view room when the dj is there. Disappointing to say the least,2-Aug-13,1
"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a week of vacation in San Francisco and had a great stay. The hotel is located in the heart of Union Square and is close to everything you can think of. There is great shopping, dining and bars all within walking distance from the Hyatt. We never ate at the hotel, but did get drinks one night at the bar, which were a little pricey, but we expected it. The room we stayed in overlooked Union Square and had great views of the city. The room was always clean and tidy. Our room had a king size bed that was very firm. I prefer a more soft mattress, but was able to manage with the bed for the week. The black out drapes were a nice perk and did an amazing job keeping the light in the morning. The in-room WiFi was fantastic and never gave us any problems. The front desk staff and bellmen were great. We had an issue one night with the people next door to us coming home drunk and making too much noise. I called down to the front desk at 2:30 AM to see if they could do something about it. They sent not one, but two security members up to the room in no less than 5 minutes of my call, I was more than impressed. Susan (I think that was her name) helped us out at the concierge's desk to plan a day trip to Monterey/Pebble Beach and rent a car for the trip. She was also a big help with making reservations for dinner on a few occasions. Overall, my wife and I had a great trip to San Francisco and the Grand Hyatt played a major role in it! We would definitely consider staying here again if we came back to San Fran!",2-Aug-13,5
"Location is excellent, next to Union Square. Parking is a rip off at 45USD per night. Staff are helpfull and friendly. Soundproofing is dreadful. Constant noise coming into the room from adjacent rooms and from the outside. Very high tec power shower heads but low water pressure render them useless. Would I stay there again? No chance ! ",1-Aug-13,3
"This is a nice hotel in San Fracisco. The rooms were on the smaller side, but they were clean and furnishing was up to date. The lobby was very nice, but a little small for the size of the hotel, so I found myself going to the meeting area where the conference rooms were located. The front desk service was great and the entire hotel staff was able to deliver extraordinary service. The location of this property is great, short drive to North Beach and the Piers. If you park a car, leave at least 1/2 hour for them to pull it around.",1-Aug-13,4
This is a very nice hotel located right next to Union Square. Handy for all the shops and the cable car terminus for that run down to the piers. We had a room on the 32nd floor with great views over San Francisco. We had room only but the hotel did have a coffee bar on the ground floor which was sufficient for a quick breakfast in the room. We did not try the restaurant as there is plenty of choice on your doorstep. Overall a very nice hotel in a great location.,31-Jul-13,4
"Enjoyed every moment of our stay. The staff are just wonderful- from housekeeping to bell desk to reception, the service is flawless. Reception and concierge are fantastic. The concierge, Joanne booked our Alcatraz tours and we found her so efficient and friendly. The refurbished hotel rooms are well designed and thought out. They are not mean with their amenities which is important as many 5 star hotels are skimping on basic stuff like shower gel these days which is frankly ridiculous!The negatives:  the accommodation definitely has poor soundproofing of adjacent doors. We were on a quiet floor on level 28 but we could hear a crying man and noisy family on either side of us. They clearly didn't understand the concept of quiet floor!! The only other negative was the bath plumbing which made continual strange noises when the bath tub was full. ",31-Jul-13,5
"The hotel is huge and extremely well located... Like one block away of everything!Room, although is a little too small is great and has a little bit of technology everywhere - till today I'm wondering where to switch on main room light.Minibar unfortunately is empty... ;(Breakfast restaurant is too small for the size of hotel and service so so... Buffet ok but not enough variety ...",30-Jul-13,4
"As they say, you pay for.. LOCATION, LOCATION! and this hotel has it! No taxis are needed on a daily basis. It is walking distance to the best shopping and some of the best restaurants in the city. Bus transportation is right around the corner, as well as the trolley car. Starbucks is accross the street. The Concierge service here is the best I have ever experienced! They take time with everyone, and with a smile on their face. We were travling with our family of 7 having problems with getting resevations in restaurants, as well as some booked attractions. Joanna was creative, and helped figure out a way for our family to get tickets. Liz follwed through with getting our family every reservation needed. It was worth staying at this hotel just for the great service they provided. Our family vacation was saved thanks to the concierge service!",30-Jul-13,5
"This is my go to hotel whilst traveling to San Francisco, The rooms are wonderful as is the staff and the amenities. The best part is that hotel is so centrally located and walking distance to most of San Fran's tourist/business locations of interest. The best aspect of the hotel is the staff who make you feel welcomed from the moment you walk through door. The only complaint I have and this is a more of a preference is that the mattresses are too soft.Can't wait to stay here again when I am in SFO in November.FYI The renovations make the hotel more appealing then ever.",30-Jul-13,5
"We arrived at the hotel and found a group of 10-15 people at the check-in so we joined the long queue. We were really amazed to discover that in just a couple of minutes we where at the desk and minutes later in our room. The staff is exactly what you want after a long flight: friendly, professional and straight to the point.We had a city view room on the higher floors and the view from there is great, especially at dawn or at night. The room seemed to be recently refurbished and the quality is very high: no noise and the bed is very comfortable.The location is also perfect to visit San Francisco: you can catch the cable cars just one block away, the shopping district is on the other side of the road and with the public transport you can easily get to Fisherman Wharf or the Pier 1.",30-Jul-13,5
Stayed three (3) nights in two rooms with family in mid-July on a Grand Club floor (31st). Rooms are very nice after the remodel and the Grand Club on the 30th floor is spectacular. The service is top notch and the location cannot be beat. One of the better hotels in San Francisco.,30-Jul-13,5
"You cannot beat this location right across the street from chinatown, union square a few blocks from north beach, theatre district, and more. The lobby is a little cramped and they have revamped it so that you stand a sort of desk with the agent checking you in: I find it a little offputting and prefer the old method. But the agents are friendly and efficient. I'm platinum level and had reserved a room on the exec club level. exec club is a bargain if you can upgrade to it as it includes snacks, breakfast, hors d'oeuvres, inexpensive mix your cocktails and a dedicated business center. The view rooms have outstanding views. The rooms were refurbished a couple of years ago and are pretty nice if a little cramped.",29-Jul-13,3
"I normally stay at the Hilton which is a nice hotel, but could not get in so my company booked me here. WOW, recently remodeled this property is very nice, The room design is great. It is one of the VERY few hotels that designed for the business traveler, outlets in the RIGHT place, Lights in the RIGHT place, even the design of the shower - shelving int he RIGHT place.Highly recomennded",26-Jul-13,5
Stayed at old version 6 years ago and refurb makes this an excellent place to stay.rooms and bathrooms are very modern and loved the remote contrlol for lighting and curtains--not complicated just very good.hotel is central for most must do sight seeing etc.A big must is cycle the Golden Gate bridge .visit Sausilito-- go back on ferry--sheer heaven.Giants ballpark great day out with wow views.MUST MUST UPGRADE TO HIGHER FLOOR CLUBROOM.,25-Jul-13,5
"Travel full time in business so lots of experience.Great location, great remodel, great bar, great work out room but...They have some real clunkers1. Internet is over complicated with the levels of service and none of them worked and despite several calls for tech support never could get them working2. Self park garage is third party anda total mess3. Bell service is slow and whineyHeading to the WESTIN on market",23-Jul-13,3
"The Grand Hyatt is a lovely hotel. We really enjoyed our stay here and found the staff to be friendly and the rooms to be lovely and clean. It was extremely close to Restaurants, Macy's (a great place to shop), Cable Cars, Buses etc. If you like walking, especially up a few hills, the walk into Fishermans Wharf is also worth doing. We walked to Lombard St and it was one of the nicest walks and gave you a chance to have a close look and different things. All in all we had a great time. Thank you to all involved.",23-Jul-13,5
"Stayed here on business and was pleasantly surprised - I normally stay at the Hyatt just off Embarcadero but was put up here instead and Iâ€™m glad I was. The property has been recently updated and upgraded. The experience started on the greeting by the front door staff and was followed through by the swift and efficient check in process. I received a room on the 9th floor facing north with just s small peek at the bay, which was fine. Met some coworkers at the One Up Lounge and the happy hour prices are very reasonable as others have mentioned in their reviews. Service was good but a little slow for the small amount of folks in the lounge. The room redone and very nice and the bed very comfortable - I liked the remote control blind that lower and cut out a most of the light that you control from the bed. My only complaint was that the windows do not block out the construction noise and you cannot open the slider to get some fresh air.A good stop in the morning is the coffee bar on the opposite side from the check in area, which has very hot coffee and various quick grab breakfast items (muffins, hot sandwiches and dry cereal) I also appreciated having a choice of which newspapers at each elevator lobby.I noticed a nice mix of business and vacation travelers staying at the hotel. I was talking to a British couple and they thought the hotel was a perfect jumping off point on their touring around San Francisco. Next trip I will be back and stay here and I look forward to having some time to explore the area and the many stores close by.",22-Jul-13,5
"My husband & I spent 5 nights in June. We're very happy that we choose this hotel. The location is perfect right by Union Square, shops, public transportation, Wallgreen, Bakery, Starbuck, China Town - everything you need just in walking distance.Check-in was smooth. Thanks to Meagan, she's so friendly, funny & helpful. She gave us a room in the 10th floor. We didn't care about the view (it's a city view), what we wanted is a safe, clean, quiet, comfortable room. The room was big enough for us, the bed was very comfy, amenities were good, the room , towels , etc, were always clean. The House Keeper did a very good job. She always left a thank you notice for the gratuity. Well, actually all the staff were very friendly & helpful. All in all we're very satisfied. We had great stay, and will definitely stay here again.",22-Jul-13,5
"My stay at this Grand Hyatt property was a result of a booking error on my part. I thought that I had reserved a room at the Hyatt Regency in the Financial District near the Embarcadero. It wasn't until I landed that I realized my mistake. The good news is that my stay at the Grand Hyatt turned out to be a pleasant surprise and upgrade in quality. This property was recently renovated from top to bottom. The finishes are tasteful and everything is new. I was assigned a room on the 30th floor that provided panoramic views of Union Square, The Financial District and the Bay. Some of the best shopping in the country are at the doorstep of the hotel. As an aside, I sometimes like to sleep in past sunrise and often find that hotel blinds do not do a very good job keeping the sunlight out of the room. The blinds at this property are a positive exception and provided near blackout conditions when drawn. The Grand Club lounge (32 floor) was staffed by attentive folks that took great pride in providing a comfortable environment for guests to relax. The food offerings were more expansive and seemed to be of higher quality than other Grand Clubs that I have visited recently. The views from the lounge are some of the best in all of San Francisco. The Grand Hyatt is now my Hyatt property of choice when staying in San Francisco.",21-Jul-13,5
We stayed here for 5 days over 4th of July 2013. Great central location. Concierge was wonderful and got us a late booking to Alcatraz even though all tour companies fully booked. Has breakfast at the restaurant and best eggs Benedict ever. F&B director came to our table and gave us suggestions on local points if interest. Wonderful guy and great rep for Hyatt. A couple says later saw us in the lobby and stopped to chat to see how our trip wa going. Staff treated us with personal customer focus. Will recommend and stay here again.,21-Jul-13,5
"This particular Grand Hyatt has been in Union Square for umpteen years as I remember it when I first came to San Francisco 30 years ago. It has recently been renovated so the lobby, restaurants, and rooms are all very modern and new looking. Let me start off with the highlights of the Grand Hyatt:1. The staff at One Up Lounge (Linda, Raphael in particular) offer fantastic service and personable connections with their guests. The Lounge offers Happy Hour from 4 to 7pm and some of their beers and house wines are only $4 along with flatbreads at about $7 (50% off from $14)2. Check in customer representative, Brian, was very helpful. We arrived at about 12:45pm but our room wasn't ready so we went out for lunch and returned by 4pm. The room still wasn't ready so he kindly gave us another room on a higher floor (32nd floor) corner unit overlooking Union Square. Thank you Brian!3. A big thank you goes out to Tiffany, one of the hotel Managers, who made sure our stay was an enjoyable one. I enjoyed the buffet breakfast and thank you Tiffany!4. There is free Wi Fi in every guest room and it is very speedy so no need to pay for it at the Grand Hyatt. 5. The rooms are modern, new with electronic blinds, free coffee in room, and the best is the little fridge that has no mini bar in it. It is so convenient to have a little fridge for drinks, milk, or medication without needing to empty out the mini bar.6. There is free drinking water beside the ice machine so you can fill up your water bottle anytime without needing to carry liters of water back to the hotel from Walgreens.7. Daily complimentary newspapers which was great to keep up with the news8. There is a Starbucks coffee directly across from the hotel or there is a coffee bar set up in the hotel, across from Concierge, every morning which also serves coffee and pastries. 9. The hotel's location is wonderfully close to Chinatown and all the fantastic shops like Macys, Nordstroms, Saks Fifth, and other high end fashion boutiques.10. If you happen to forget any toiletries from home, the hotel offers an extensive list of amenities that you can request. ex: corkscrew, razor, slippers, deodorant,and the list goes on. We found this so useful especially if we forget this and that. 11. The Housekeeping staff is superb! They do a great job in respecting the Do Not Disturb sign and keeps our room extremely tidy and clean.Now a few hiccups that we felt--This is by no fault of the hotel but because of the age of this building:1. Even being on the 32nd floor, you can still hear the loud sirens, the construction (mostly weekedays only) which is directly across from the hotel on Stockton street because they are building a new metro stop there, and the music from the Square.2. On windy days, the glass door (permanently shut) will shiver a bit and you can hear the winds quite a bit against the glass. 3. I did not see any ventilation fan in the bathroom so if someone goes you know what, there is no fan to draw out the smell.4. The rooms are small with either 1 king or 2 double beds with no queen beds. This is a great property for business travelers (single) or a couple but if you have more than 2 people in the room, then it is very tight in space. The washroom is very small but very well lit.5. Our bathtub is probably still the original tub before pre reno days because it is not a soaker tub and when you stand on it to shower, there is a spot where it will make a hollow crackling noise. I believe it is one of those acrylic tubs thus making this sound. 6. Some concierge members can be more friendly and less arrogant. When certain concierge was asked about the Bart and bus system to get to a destination, the knowledge was somewhat lacking. Liz, the Cle d""Or concierge was fantastically knowledgeable and helpful always with a smile on her face. Thank you Liz!7. The valet guys and the doormen were wonderfully friendly and helpful. In all, the hotel is very nice but because of the age of the building, the noise issue and the ventilation problem can not be helped. If they can only replace their glass doors with much thicker glass, install bathroom ventilation, and replace the double beds with queen beds, then I would say this Grand Hyatt would be nearly perfect. Thank you for a great stay and see you soon!",20-Jul-13,4
"We stayed here for 5 nights at the start of our honeymoon, since we had work in San Francisco before we could jet off on holiday. While not the most romantic of hotels, we very much enjoyed our stay. It's a modern, clean, nicely designed building. Our room had a great view over the city. We liked the high-tech features, e.g. button-controlled blinds. It was very clean, spacious and functional. The staff were very helpful. The location, by Union Square, was great. The perfect place to stay if you are on business or a short leisure trip. I'd normally rate it at 4 stars, but we benefitted from a very good work deal, meaning we paid a lot less than we should have, so I'm going to bump it all the way up to 5 stars!!",20-Jul-13,5
"Stayed at the Grand for 6 nights in early July and admit it was a very nice 'home away from home'. Requested a higher floor with a bay view based on reviews I had read prior to our trip. We were given a room on the 27th floor and were not disappointed. We were fortunate to be in SF during a period of extremely good weather and the views we were afforded were spectacular. Great sightlines across Chinatown and North Beech and out over the bay.The rooms at the Grand had recently been updated and the place was spotless. The bed was extremely comfortable and the furnishings modern. Only a couple minor annoyances as the television volume was a bit on the low side (even my wife commented) and there could have been a little more pressure in the shower, Otherwise A+ all the way.Staff at the Grand were very friendly and helpful....special kudos to the doormen. Did have breakfast there one morning at the OneUp. Food was very good with lots of selection, though it was on the expensive side. Being close to Union Square there is a wide selection of diners nearby. I would recommend walking one block to Sears for a great breakfast at a good price. The location of the Grand is good, it is just steps from Union Square and close to public transportation. Depending on the nature of your visit to SF this area could be a plus or minus. Shopping, restaurants, hop on / hop off....great location, sightseeing tours, hanging out at fishermans wharf, etc......you might want to stay in that area. Having said that, getting around SF is really not that difficult. We walked from pier 39 to our hotel after the 4th fireworks and did the same from AT&T after a ball game. Long walks to be sure but do-able if you have decent footwear.After a long day in SF we ordered room service and were pleasantly surprised. Our meal was presented to us on a portable table (with linens of course) in front of the floor to ceiling window overlooking beautiful SF at night. What a nice way to cap off our stay. We definitely recommend this hotel.",20-Jul-13,4
"We spent 4 nights at Grand Hyatt at Union Sq. and we liked it a lot. After 3 hours delay from Las Vegas due to the plane crash just a couple of days ago and with only one runway operating, and then a taxidriver overspeeding and was pulled aside by the police in traffic controll, we finally got to the hotel at 01.30 am. Tired but happy that we finally was at our last destination, we spoke to a very nice frontdesk employee who gave us a upgraded hotelroom with a stunning view over SF skyline and the bay. The room was very fresh, modern and well equipped. We had a room with 2 double beds, but they were very small to be double beds (or queen beds, about 120 cm) and we barely manged to fit in. The hotel is very modern and nice. The service level is high and the employees are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The Grand Hyatt has a perfect location just one block from China Town, 20 min. walk to North Beach, next to Union Square and 5 min. walk to Market street. The only negative is the stiff price for a buffet breakfast. We tryed it once at a price of $25 each and we were not impressed. The breakfast was good and the waiters very nice and attentive, but they had no fresh bread or rolls just stale bagels and toast and very little coldcuts to choose from, but they had bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages and potatoes. To be fair they also had other options that was cheaper. Overall we had a great stay and would highly recommend Grand Hyatt.",20-Jul-13,5
"Grand Hyatt San Fran is conveniently located one block from union square which has all the premium shopping (Saks, L.V., Rolex, etc.) stores boarding. Within walking distance from China Town, Mall, pickup spot for ""BigBus Tour"" and fine dining options all over (OneUp located in hotel is a great option). The customer service is very professional and always courteous. The rooms were clean and considerate of late sleepers (I slept in and they still freshened up the room once I left). Although they did not have a pool or hot tub, I would still stay at this hotel over others because of the location and great customer service. ",19-Jul-13,4
"My husband and I were extremely disappointed with our stay at the Grand Hyatt. We are Hyatt Platinum members and are supposed to be given rooms on higher floors, etc. This was not the case. We were put on the 18th floor out of 36. As soon as we got to our room, we knew that something was wrong. We could hear everything outside. And I mean everything, I could hear the cars driving by 18 floors below. We called the front desk and after being on hold for 10 minutes finally spoke to them and they sent up an engineer. His method for dealing with the draft and noise was to slam the fake door/window closed as hard as he could. That was all he could do for us and he left. Later that night when we tried to go to bed, we were awaken because it sounded like there was a rave taking place in our room. I again called the main desk to complain, and once again after being on hold for about 5 minutes, we were told there was nothing that they could do, and that there was a street party 2 blocks away for French Independence Day. The next day we left early in the morning and arrived back in the early afternoon. Once again I could hear everything going on down on the ground level. I called the front desk again, and they finally offered to move our room, really it took 3 calls of complaints to get my room changed. Unfortunately, they moved us to a handicap room. On top of the outside noise issue, the walls in the hotel are paper thin. We could hear talking and vacuuming in rooms around us, which makes me uneasy, because that means people can hear us in our room, as well. Also the maid service comes around to clean rooms at 8:30am. I'm realize we were staying in the business area of San Francisco, but I've never been to any hotel who cleans rooms that early, and I did not appreciate being woken up at 8:30am on my vacation. After the first morning, we always left the do not disturb sign on our door before heading to bed. Honestly, there are just way to many issues with this hotel. I'm sure there are way nicer places to stay in San Francisco, and now I'm wondering if we should consider moving away from the Hyatt brand and bringing our business elsewhere.",19-Jul-13,2
"Great location. Great hotel. This is a business hotel, not a resort. The rooms are super clean and updated. The staff is service oriented. The location is perfect, especially if you want to go to China Town for an amazing dinner.",19-Jul-13,5
"Am pleased that we chose to stay in this hotel, having earlier tried the Mandarin Oriental. The Hyatt is better placed, right by Union Square, meaning it is very convenient for shops and for connections to the subway and trams.Our perception of the hotel got off to a great start, thanks to an exceptionally helpful member of staff (thank Yena Choi) who was so personable - even remembering our name/ room number) during our visit. This made us feel very at home, which is unusual in a large, busy hotel like this.The rooms were comfortable, with all we could ask for. The Fitness Centre was more than adequate and appeared rarely used, despite the amazing views from the 32nd floor across the city skyline.Conclusion: Definitely would recommend this hotel and will stay there again.",18-Jul-13,5
"My wife and I spent 3 nights in San Francisco at Grand Hyatt and thoroughly enjoyed our holiday. Check-in was smooth and we stayed in a suite, with a stunning view of Alcatraz island (view attached). The bar area of the hotel is very nice and modern. The location of the hotel is fantastic, it is easily accessible and no real complaints about the hotel. A very pleasant stay.",17-Jul-13,5
"We traveled throughout California during the 4th of July week/weekend. We traveled with 2 adults, 2 kids, and a small dog. We stayed 3 days and 2 nights at this location and it was great! Its a great location for Families since Union Square is right across the street. The Powell Street Cable Car is a few blocks down and the shopping is great in this area. The hotel is pet friendly and the staff is very knowledgeable and very friendly. The rooms are adequate, and the beds are small, but comfortable. We stayed on the 28th floor with a view of Union Square. Very nice city view! We traveled with 2 adults, 2 kids, and a small dog. The only downfall to this location is parking. You have the option to pay $33+ if you self park it across the street, or $56 for Valet. Not good options if you are staying at this location with a vehicle.",16-Jul-13,4
"we arrived without a reservation, got off right at Embarcadero and had no idea where to go, we started walking and just got there, very nice area, close to everything including the cable cars, restaurant and shopping.We first were met by a very rude front desk lady, but then Amy treated us really nice and she gave us an upgrade to a very nice Suite, with a balcony, 2 bathrooms and beautiful living area, it was so nice we actually decided to stay one night in and rent a movie.The guys at the bar ( Carlos and the guys from Mazatlan) were amazing, they were very nice to us, also the concierge ladies.Rates are high, i wish i did my homework before arriving.",16-Jul-13,4
"Can'r beat the location right in Union Square. Recently renovated with new bar/restaurant on floor 2 and fitness center (that rocked) up on the top floor. Super friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms, big flat screen TV's. This is my new favorite hotel in SF.",15-Jul-13,4
"The hotel are close to union square shops,restaurants and mall, the rooms are nice and the location suberb,the only but is the cleaness, the rooms should be well prepared,the dust at the lamps and under the furniture should be watched for the manager or the housekeeping,will return",14-Jul-13,4
"The hotel rooms are great the location is awsome close to union square shops,restaurants and mall,the only but was that the rooms that should be more cleaness,overwall was ok,but the lamps and down the furniture needs some one to watch,will stay again",14-Jul-13,4
We stayed at the grand Hyatt over July 4 and it was fabulous! We had an upgrade to a suite on a high floor that had spectacular views and was very quiet( there was a sign that it was a quiet floor. We would definitely stay there again,14-Jul-13,5
"I recently went on a business trip to San Francisco and brought along my family (4&7 year olds and husband). I was a little concerned ahead of time because SF rooms can be small. Not the case at all here. We had 2 double beds on the 25th floor, and the kids loved looking down at the city and counting the taxis. The room was *very* clean and appeared to be newly remodeled. The beds were super comfortable. The location was great, too - I was able to walk about 10 minutes to the Moscone Center for Semicon. My family was able to walk to Chinatown, a Children's Creativity Museum and Carousel, and had easy access to trolleys/busses/fairies. I sometimes wonder about high costs of hotels in big cities (especially near convention centers) but this was a case where I think the value was worth it. They even had a ""free"" wi-fi option, which wasn't super fast, but very tolerable. There were also a million places to eat, and the area felt safe day and night (I was out up to ~11PM). Highly recommended hotel!",12-Jul-13,5
The best hotel I've stayed at in sfo in many years of visiting moscone center in July. One small gripe about the modern laptop check in islands which just seemed to confuse everyone and slow things down. Otherwise perfect stay. ,12-Jul-13,5
"The Grand Hyatt has a terrific location one block from Union Square. It is walking distance to all Union Square restaurants, the trolley stops, and is very close to China Town. The staff was very courteous and helpful - from teh doorman to the front desk to the concierge. The rooms were very nice and seemingly recently renovated. The beds were comfortable; the rooms had all kinds of techological gadgets (including curtains that opened with the touch of a button); and were equipped with a refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer, etc. The concierge gave good recommendations for restaurants.Some negatives included: street noise, even 15 floors up; the bathroom doors hang on a track outside the bathroom wall and slide shut - but leave a 1/2 - 1 inch gap eliminating privacy; and there was mildew in one of the showers.One other significant feature was the discounted rate for a second room to accommodate our children. The adjoining room was $99/night - very nice touch when traveling with several children, and was likely the deciding factor in staying here.Overall, the hotel was a modern, well-located, service oriented hotel that we enjoyed.",10-Jul-13,4
"I used to work as a consultant before my current job so I have seen many many hotels in my life, most of them good with no big complaints but the experience I had with this hotel was simply amazing. I was very impressed with the service; they were always on top of everything... I traveled with my 2 years old daughter to spend 4th of July in San Francisco and everything was just perfect. They gave her the option to choose a new toy when we were checking in and she really liked that and she got one more toy when were having dinner in the second floor... The location was perfect. I didnâ€™t even need to rent a car, everything was really close and the taxis are not that expensive in the city. The room was very nice and elegant, we got the 24th floor so it had a great view... recommended 100%",9-Jul-13,5
"We stayed 18 floors up and still heard every siren, car, backing trucks, etc... Nice hotel with great service but very hard to sleep. Getting your car out of Valet took forever also. IF they would sound proof their rooms if might be worth it. Otherwise pick another hotel-for sleep",8-Jul-13,3
"Refurbished since my last review the hotel is great. Rooms are a decent size with amenities including fridge, coffee making and wifi. The new decoration of the room is a big improvement. Helpful staff and good value plus a great location by Union Square.",7-Jul-13,5
We stayed here to break our journey up back to the UK. This hotel was nice and clean and the staff were very helpful. The only thing I would say about this hotel is that being on the front of the hotel was very noisy.,7-Jul-13,3
"My husband and I were on a SCAL Road trip from San Diego visiting Santa Barbara, Carmel and San Fran. The Grand Hyatt was our final stay for two nights and it was wonderful from check in to check out. We upgraded to the 33rd floor and the view was amazing. The room was very clean, spacious with a comfortable bed and we loved the auto shade and ""welcome"" lighting. The food was good, friendly service with lots of smiles. Our bartender Phil was attentive and extremely helpful with hints on what to do and how to get around town. Now our 2nd favorite Hyatt (fav is Maui). We had thought about staying at several other nearby hotels and were so glad we stayed at Hyatt. We'll be back.",6-Jul-13,5
"Spent 6 days with family at a conference in downtown. Everything about the hotel was excellent, in particular the attentiveness of the staff. Rooms above 20th floor have great views. Great fitness center. Next to Union Square and central to everything in town. If I had to find a flaw the breakfast prices are high but there is a Starbucks on either side of the entrance plus a coffee bar in the lobby. Overall I highly recommend this hotel and if you search and plan to visit at the right time you can find a very good rate.",5-Jul-13,5
Such a wonderful location for San Fransisco. Hotel room on 11th floor overlooked Union Square. Great sized rooms and bathroom. Good amenities and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend for families couples or singles traveling. ,3-Jul-13,5
"This is an above average hotel in one of the most sought after parts of town. With a little homework, you can get a great rate. And the location can't be beat. Some might like being closer to the water or in a quieter neighborhood and those all have their own appeals. But if you want to be close to good dining, shopping and ease of access to other places, either on foot, by car or public transportation, Union Square can't beat.We were upgraded to a quiet floor and had a view of the Bay from Alcatraz to the TransAmerica Tower. Our room was clean and spacious. We were also at the end of the hall so it was extra quiet. We asked the conceirge for recommendations on several occasions and each time got good advice. I highly recommend this hotel.",2-Jul-13,5
"I stayed at this hotel june 25 to 28 for an annual conference. I enjoyed my stay tremendously. My room was prepaid by my company so checkin was very smooth. My room was spacious and quite dainty. The entire staff was friendly and cordial at all times. My room was cleaned to my satisfaction on a daily basis. The hotel was centrally located downtown within walking distance of my fav shops- Macys, DSW, to name a few. If you are ever in San Fran stay here! ",2-Jul-13,5
"This property is centrally located, within walking distance to major attractions. All the rooms were recently updated and it appears the entire hotel went through a face lift. The overall decor is more modern, like most other hotels of the same class. Customer service was attentive, very friendly and helpful. My only complaint, if I had to point out one, would be that there are not enough elevators to service the 50+ floors. Sometimes you will have to wait a while for an elevator to arrive.",2-Jul-13,4
"My room was on the 20th floor overlooking Union Square. A fabulous view of the mountains and the city at night. The walls are a little thin so if you have a rowdy neighbour it may be problematic. I was there for a conference and the hotel was booked; even though I could hear my next door peers, it wasn't disturbing. Get a higher up room to cancel outside noise because I could hear the concerts in Union Square but it was fain from the 20th floor. The room was extremely comfortable and because it was a corner room had a recessed toilet/bath and closet/vanity area which gave the main room even more space. I took a business plan with a king bed which included free breakfast and internet. There is a 'fridge and percolator but no microwave in the room which doesn't matter because there are many great restaurants within walking distance. I walked everywhere including to Chinatown (the one for tourists, not the real one) and down to the harbour (about 45mins). Do take a ride on the ferry. A friend walked all the way to the Golden Gate bridge which would be about 2 hours. The financial district and fabulous high (Gucci, Tiffany's etc.) and medium/low cost shopping (Macy's, Old Navy's, Ross) are all a walk a way. You don't need to hire a taxi for anything but do take the tram just for fun. The room was exceptionally comfortable and the toiletries paraben free which was icing on the cake! A good stay too for couples or family. The buffet breakfast was wonderful and catered for a wide range of tastes including me and my yogurt with pumpkin and sunflower seeds every morning. And freshly brewed green tea! The dinner wasn't so accommodating to us vegetarians but as I said there are many restaurants within walking distance. If you take a bus tour do take the open aired bus and really see the place. I got trapped in a normal bus and missed a lot of the sites having to peer around my seating neighbour or if an attraction was on the other side of the bus. San Francisco is beautiful and the people are warm. It is definitely one of my favourite cities. Hilton to me is huge so that you can get lost (which my friend and I did looking for her room in tower something or the other) and the numerous additions have left it looking like a hodge podge. Grand Hyatt is crisper, cleaner and with friendlier staff.",1-Jul-13,4
"The hotel is really good, modern, clean, nice location just by union square and by nice boutiques. Our room had also a very nice view as we where on the 18th floor.The only thing we disliked was the thinness of the room door. We didn't get the choice to hear or ignore the other room's door slap late at night (2am) and early in the morning (6am) but maybe it was just our bad educated rooms neighbors.",30-Jun-13,4
"Went there for 10 days to attend a conference and celebrate my engagement. We asked for a king bed room upon reservation and confirmation. As we got to the hotel we were frustrated to be handeld a 2 beds room. When we first talked to the girl at the check in we were told there was nothing they could do. After a small gilt trip on her conscience we got a king bed room on a higher floor. The view was great. The room a bit small, but very nice, just renovated.Parking is quite expensive (40/night).Doormen do not open the door for you and seem to be payed to chat.Conciergerie did not help, and made a reservation to a regular restaurant when we asked for help to make a reservation in a fancy one.There is free wifi.And you can not forget the LOCATION. It is great!!!",30-Jun-13,4
We were on the 43rd floor and had such an amazing view of the harbour I couldn't believe it. I specifically asked for a high room with a nice view as we were celebrating my husbands 50th birthday but never expected anything so fabulous. The view of the fog moving in was amazing. The complimentary bottle of wine was also such a lovely surprise and enjoyable. Great location with loads of restaurants and shops on the door step. Consierge was extremely helpful in advance of my stay recommending restaurants and things to do. The bar area was average.,29-Jun-13,4
Nice clean hotel and the staff were fine but we didnt have any issues. The area is great if you fancy shopping in macys or if your into your brands. The hotel currently does not have a gift shop to buy drinks etc and the meals in the hotel are very expensive. I wouldnt reccomend this area and would advise to stay in the fisherman wharf area for going out etc.,28-Jun-13,4
"We lucked out picking the Grand Hyatt. We'd never been to San Francisco before, but this hotel turned out to be a perfect site-seeing ""base camp."" We didn't rent a car and were able to easily walk the few short blocks from the BART. Then we were able to walk all over. Chinatown was right around the corner, catching a Hop On/Hop Off tour bus was only a block or two down, as was catching the buses and trolley cars. The concierge was helpful getting us last-minute tickets to Alcatraz (and advising us to book while we had a chance, as the tours sell out fast. If we'd waited until the next morning we wouldn't have gotten tickets. And we were lucky period we were at the end of busy season because Alcatraz sells out weeks in advance, which we didn't know.) It was a long walk, but doable, to Fisherman's Wharf. We had a blast walking all over in fact, and the hotel proved the perfect starting point for all of our adventures each day. Plus, the rooms were spacious and the bathrooms pristine. Oh, and our room came with the buffet upstairs every morning, which was pretty decent from a choice/selection standpoint and offered excellent views of the city.",27-Jun-13,5
"We just returned from a trip to San Francisco and we could not have been happier with our stay at the Grand Hyatt. Clean, modern decor, great location, concierge was very helpful, staff was attentive all the way around. We were celebrating our anniversary and arrived to find complimentary wine in our room. Just can not say enough good things about this hotel.",26-Jun-13,5
"We stayed as a family of 5 (baby and 2 small kids) in a double queen room for a week whilst my husband was at a conference. There are a lot of challenges involved in that especially without a kitchen or laundry but the hotel staff were so helpful and accommodating and the location so good that it made thestay enjoyable. Particular mention to the awesome girls on the breakfast coffee cart in the lobby who my girls ""adopted"" and who are just lovely. Great coffee and food as well. There is a laundromat just up the road as well if you find yourself in the same boat as me! ",25-Jun-13,5
"My wife and I recenly returned from a two night stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Having never been to the city we were looking for something centrally located. The Hyatt just off Union Square was perfect. We had a 10-15 walk to most everything we wanted to do.The service at the hotel was excellent! From check-in to check-out the staff went over and above to meet and exceed our needs. The hotel was recently renovated and it shows. From the high tech front desk to the electronic window shades in the rooms, there were nice touches everywhere. The rooms were very modern, clean and we had a great view of the city from the 20th floor.I would not hesitate to recommend this property to any of my friends or colleagues.",25-Jun-13,5
"We just returned from a 4 night stay at this wonderful hotel. The check-in and check-out process was very efficient and the staff was very professional. We loved the modern, clean room with very comfortable beds. A big plus for me was having a digital room thermostat that worked great and an electronic privacy curtain that made the room very dark for sleeping. The hotel location was perfect to see many sites and near the cheap public transportation stops. There are many terrific stores and restaurants within walking distance and the concierge desk was so very helpful in making suggestions and also reservations for you. We were very happy with the Grand Hyatt!!",24-Jun-13,5
"The service was great. The moment our cab from the airport pulled up, employees were opening doors and assisting with luggage. Check in was a breeze, and even though our room wasn't quite ready yet, it only took about 20 minutes to get it ready. Everyone that we came in contact with was friendly and professional. We were on the 9th floor, so we could hear a little bit of traffic noise, but not enough to keep us up at night or disturb us in any way. The rooms were super clean, very comfy. The staff will help you out with anything you may have forgotten. The fitness center was very nice, as compared to other hotel fitness centers, and the view from the equipment can't be beat. Cable cars were right around the corner, as well as stores and restaurants. I was impressed. When we return to San Francisco, we will definitely stay here again.",24-Jun-13,5
"My daughter and I just returned from a 3 night stay at this lovely hotel. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with professionalism and warmth. Really appreciate the upgrade to a higher floor with nice view. We were on a ""quiet"" floor which was perfect for us. The room was modern, extremely clean and had very comfy beds!! We made use of club for breakfast 1 morning and appetizers and wine a couple of evenings. Nice selections and could actually make a light meal from it. And view and atmosphere were great!The location was perfect for seeing the city. We had muni passes and public transit easy to obtain. Walking distance to many places.Had breakfast twice in One Up. Fantastic buffet and great service...thanks Danny!I wish I could remember the name of the lady who checked us in...maybe Yena? ... A special thanks to her also.I researched many, many hotels (with reservations at several) before deciding on this one...I was very happy with this choice!!",23-Jun-13,5
"I've stayed here several times for business and it provides very consistent quality with free wifi and a wonderful location right off Union Square and on the edge of Chinatown. It is my first choice. The lobby is small, and they recently converted the top floor restaurant/bar to conference space. Too bad -- the views of the city were amazing.",23-Jun-13,4
The remodel was a success. Location was great for site seeing and shopping. You will enjoy your stay. The staff was helpful and polite. Love this place. A short walk to Union square and the cable cars. Downtown rental cars are just blocks away. Some great restaurants are a short walk away.,23-Jun-13,5
"The Grand Hyatt is in a great location just off Union Square. The renovation is good and although the rooms are small by Asian Grand Hyatt standards, the fit out was very nice. The room just seemed to work, bed very comfortable and Club good. The only downside is that all rooms have sliding opening doors to outside (open 3 inches and no balcony) that's fine except the seal between the doors is long gone and so the outside noise is very noticeable. After all, you are in the middle of a city. We asked for it to be repaired but that didnt occur. The bar and bistro on Upper floor was very nice too as was the service from the concierge.",23-Jun-13,4
"This hotel is in a great location, however the staff have a lot to learn about service. We have travelled a lot, and this w the worst service we had received in America. This hotel could be a really great hotel, should the service be improved. I would ow ever stay here again. ",22-Jun-13,3
"It was our first trip to San Francisco and before arriving to this hotel we stayed one night at Hyatt in Fisherman's Wharf because Grand Hyatt was fully booked. Both of the hotels were great but the staff at Grand Hyatt was not so friendly and accommodating. I can't say that they were rude or unhelpful, but they just didn't try to go an extra mile to make our stay more pleasant. Since the hotel is so big and there are so many guests, it's perfectly understandable. But I personally prefer more boutique-style hotels where you feel more like at home. This hotel is great but you will always feel like a part of a big depersonalized touristic conveyor.Apart from that I can't complain much. The location is amazing. Rooms have been recently renovated and look great. Try to get a room at the top floors since the views on the city are amazing",21-Jun-13,4
"Me and my sister stayed here in May. First off let me start by saying that San Francisco is my favorite city. We have visited 4 times and stayed at different hotels each time. We have stayed in different locations each time also. While non of the hotels were bad (they all were good in their own way) none of them were perfect... meaning while one might have a great location, the view wasn't that great ... or maybe the hotel was wonderful but the location wasn't great... you get my meaning. Well let me just say the Grand Hyatt met all of out expectations and then some. From the moment we stepped into the newly renovated lobby (it is a little different than most lobbies (the computers are just on small desks not behind one massive long counter).. but that is just a little strange ..not bad or good just different, until we checked out everything was great. Our room was beautiful with the best view of the bay, Alcatraz and Coit Tower, . Union Square is just about 1/2 block away, so there are many restaurants (Sears Fine Foods was a good one) and shopping galore right outside the door. The tours that the concierge recommended left right at union square , we bought our tickets at the hotel. We took the double decker bus hop on hop off for 2 days and that was our mode of transportation. The concierge was wonderful in arranging a rental car for us (they even dropped it at the hotel) and we sat at the bar one night after a day of sight seeing which was great.... good drinks and great flat bread pizza. Fisherman's wharf and Pier 39 are not close but again the tours takes you right there, but I wouldn't want to stay near there anyway it is very touristy .......so I loved going there and having a bread bowl but not staying there. This hotel isn't cheap (but what hotel worth anything in San Fran is....) but it was worth the money. Trust me when I tell you that you will love everything about it.",20-Jun-13,5
I stayed here in September of 2012 for a business conference. The city was packed but the hotel was well prepared and I had no problem checking in. Rooms were nicely appointed and the service was great. I had issues with my light one night and someone was there within 10 minutes to fix it. Perfect for a business trip and I would stay here for pleasure as well.,20-Jun-13,4
"Really enjoyed my stay last week here. City View rooms are well worth it. The location is within an easy walk to China town, Union Square and public transport. Web checkin and checkout made life a lot easier. Bed would be one of the most comfortable I have stayed at over all my years in nice hotels for business and pleasure. Free wifi was a bonus.",19-Jun-13,4
"The newly renovated rooms here are very pleasant! An updated version of 70's Danish modern that really works. The lobby lounge is delightful. Only downside is the dim check-in area. Grateful for the free Wi-Fi, and the water dispenser (although the one on our floor was continually empty).",19-Jun-13,4
"This recently upgraded hotel is really lovely. Excellent staff, easy check-in/check-out. Rooms are comfortable. One-cup coffee maker offers paper cups but I could use my own coffee (wrap in my own filter) in the plastic tray, works great. Huge sink is odd, seems like an invitation to do hand laundry. A sign promises that towels and sheets will be changed only on demand to protect the environment, but, like most hotels, there are no towel racks and even if you hang up towels they are changed. Excellent reading light on each side of the bed.",18-Jun-13,5
"beautifully renovated rooms and hotel in general. Free internet in the rooms and throughout the property appreciated. Paid the $50/d rate extra to access the club lounge and found it worth it. lovely view from the 32nd floor, helpful staff, terrific breakfast (one hot choice, pastries, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, etc.), heavy hors d'oeuvres, and light desserts. There's always fruit, cookies, sodas, coffee, tea available. Nice quiet area to get work done. Gym is small (4 running machines and 4 stairmasters get busy) but view is great (35th floor). would readily recommend the hotel.",16-Jun-13,5
"This hotel is fantastic. Great location, gorgeous rooms, excellent staff. We are currently staying in an Executive Suite and it is so comfortable. The two room layout makes you feel like you are in your own apartment in the city. The bed is very comfortable and the linens are of excellent quality. Views are to die for. Really, though, the crown jewel of this hotel is the customer service. The staff here really gets it. They remember your name. They are extremely kind. They smile and you really feel that they mean it. This is the mark of an excellent hotel, and not something that you can buy. It's hard to find good customer service these days. If you are craving VIP treatment by a well trained staff this is the place to stay!",16-Jun-13,5
The room is very clean and well maintained. Hotel is very conveniently located and close to union square. Loved the hotel had the facility of having a water dispenser on every floor of the hotel. It makes getting water easy. Had enjoyed my stay.,15-Jun-13,4
The hotel and rooms are nicely upgraded and clean. The bed was amazing! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We took the bus at the corner many times to different locations. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!,14-Jun-13,5
"More like 4.5 stars (or circles).This is a great location right at Union Square. Perfect for shopping and walking over to Chinatown. Here's my full breakdown:LOBBY: beautiful lobby with a fireplace towards the back. The front desk is more like multiple desks, which is nice and gives a personal and private feel. I like their soft mint candy available for the taking too. ROOMS: nice clean rooms, beautifully decorated, with a modern feel. Thin walls though as you can hear folks out in the hallway. Bed is fine, nothing special. Views depend on what side you're on (ask for the bay view). And the lower levels are noisier, so we asked for higher floor. The weekend we stayed was windy, and they were kind to notify us of potential noise and that it is normal. Rooms are spacious enough and a good closet too. Plenty of outlets to plug your electronics too.BATHROOM: Good counter space and the sink is a giant bowl/tub which I thought looked great (now I want one at home). Shower was fine with good pressure, amenities were fine, and as usual with the Hyatt you get toothpaste too. Towels were standard white towels, nothing exciting. The door (a slider door), although very pretty with the frosted glass (at least I think it was glass, maybe not, didn't notice), didn't keep the light in. So basically if someone goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night, goes in and slides the door shut, you will still definitely take notice because the light shines through the frosted door. There is no fan in the bathroom either.PARKING: Ugh. The problem with this location is that parking is horrible!! It is not the hotel's fault, it's just the way of the location. However, I will say that we were given conflicting information about valet/self-park/self-valet. Whatever it is, you're paying a lot for parking at any hotel in this area (actually this one was reasonable compared to others). With tax, we paid about $53?? a day for valet, plus tips each time. Our car rental was cheaper than that.SERVICE: Everyone was friendly from the bellmen, front desk, maintenance and housekeeping. FITNESS CENTER: I must say this fitness center was very nice for a hotel, probably one of the better ones that I've seen! Excellent views from the 35th floor and quite a few machines available too. FOOD: I actually never ate in here. So many food options in this city! OVERALL: Very pleased with the hotel and would definitely stay here again!!",14-Jun-13,4
"My husband and I were here for a conference he had so were automatically booked into this hotel. I can assure you I would not have found a better one had I searched on my own! The location is just perfect -- right at Union Square. Union Square is a destination in itself with a large plaza often filled with artists and performers. On a sunny day you can while away the afternoon at the Square whilst enjoying Italian coffee and light fare from the bistro right on the plaza. If you enjoy shopping, every major store you've ever heard of is within 2 blocks of this location. Bring an extra suitcase for all your great finds! There are 96 Starbucks in this city so you'll never be more than a block or two from one. However, for even better coffee, find the Blue Bottle coffee bar. Transportation to anywhere in the city is easy from this location -- the doubledecker buses, street cars, and cable cars all stop within a block or two. One tip is if you want to take the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf, do not go down to the starting point at Market where the que is an hour or so long. Instead, wait just by the plaza in front of the Westin St. Francis, and you'll get on much quicker from that stop!So back to the Grand Hyatt -- it has undergone a MAJOR renovation is you would think you are in a brand new hotel. The room are very clean with plenty of space. The beds are out of this world...likely the most comfy hotel bed we've ever slept in!! The linens are also very nice. The housekeeping staff was delightful and worked hard to keep our room spotless.The downsides to the hotel were this. Nothing major, but...we were on the 10th floor and the outside noise was bothersome. If you aren't used to noise, request a higher floor. The views are obviously much nicer on higher floors as well. My biggest complaint (again, minor) was that in modernizing the hotel they made the lobby very futuristic in that it is very sterile and lacking in character. So the initial impression of the hotel is not a warm one. Contrast this with the glorious lobbies of other hotels in the area that are destinatons in themselves. HOWEVER, don't judge a hotel by the lobby...I can assure you the guestrooms are incredibly nicer here at the Grand Hyatt than at any of the hotels with opulent lobbies. I would easily choose this hotel on future visits to San Francisco...it was just wonderful. If I could make a recommendation to the hotel staff, it is this...the check-in process, while very modernized, did not feel at all welcoming. We were unsure if we were to go to the computers and do a self check-in, or exactly what to do. There is just something very nice about a warm welcome to a hotel, and we didn't get this. Many of your guests probably have arrived after a long day of travel and a warm smile and ""Welcome to San Francisco"" would have gone a long way in giving us a better initial impression of the Grand Hyatt.So look no further in choosing your hotel in San Francisco. I can't wait to come back here!",14-Jun-13,5
"We stayed for 3 nights at the start and 2 nights at the end of our visit to California. Had a room on 31st floor at the beginning with a great view of the city, could see the Chinatown gateway. Room was very quiet and even on our return when we were on the 12th floor it wasn't noisy. The rooms were modern and clean with comfy bed. Location was excellent, we could walk to most places, or were close to transport. We were surrounded by many shops and restaurants. Best thing about the hotel was the staff, especially the concierge. We got so many great tips on places to go and eat. It was great to know we were coming back here for our final 2 nights. Highly recommend",13-Jun-13,5
"We had a Suite with an absolutely amazing view of the SanFran skyscrapers! The room was newly refurbished and everything was clean and very nice. We had a strange sound coming out of the aircon one day and the staff were at our room within minutes to fix the problem, so the sound was gone once we raturned to our room later this day. Only strange thing was that we had to pay for the alcoholic beverages in the grand club. Never had this anywhere else before. Staff told us that they must charge a small amount by law, because it's forbidden in CA to give away alcohol for free. The location is also very good! Just a few minutes walk to Chinatown and the BigBur Tour stops just next to the hotel. All important shopping is in this area and even the cable car stops right behind the hotel. All in all a very good experience!",11-Jun-13,5
We stayed at this beautiful hotel in April this year. We were so impressed with the level of luxury in their standard room. So modern and a fabulous view. Staff were so friendly and accommodating of our needs. In a fantastic location surrounded by great shops.,10-Jun-13,5
"A modern, sophisticated property with possibly and best location for visitors in downtown San Francisco. Smartly renovated, the rooms have extremely comforable beds, great electronic connections, bath appointments and auto shades which really darken the room. Staff is top notch with possibly the finest concierge staff in the business. Lower rooms do encounter street noise but there are 35 floors to choose from so ask for a higher floor if noise bothers you. Only item lacking, a comfortable chair in the room (or in the ultra sleek lobby for that matter). Many restaurants of all grades and prices nearby if you want to avoid typically expensive hotel fare. The food is good at the hotel, however.",7-Jun-13,4
"The location and service at Grand Hyatt are awesome. I have absolutely nothing to complain about our room either: it was spacious, modern, nice and clean (I believe it has been recently updated). There are tons of restaurants, stores and places to go around the hotel and when we needed transportation to explore the city it was a breeze to find an option (i.e. bus lines and cable cars).",6-Jun-13,5
"We stayed four nights at the Grand Hyatt for our first trip to San Fran. The rooms were what you would expect...updated, clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom was super clean and you had plenty of room for one person. There was only one sink so you couldn't have more person in there at one time. TV was awesome with all high def channels and you could plug in other devices. By far and away the best part of the hotel is the location. You are less than a 5 minute walk to all of the train and bus stations (as well as cable car starting points). This is key because it is not necessarily a walking city because of the hills. Taxi's were reasonable but it adds up quick. There was the best shopping in the city surrounding the hotel and a number of restaurants (some were very reasonable). We were a little disappointed with our view because we were only 1/3 of the way up after requesting in advance a higher room but it was a busy weekend. The lobby is a little odd in that you don't have much of one. Breakfast was included one night of our stay and it was really good but would have been very expensive. But with the choices around the hotel, not a big deal. Would definitely stay at the hotel again.",5-Jun-13,4
"Located just one block from Union Square, very central to walk everywhere or catch public transport. We were there with my elderly mother and I was concerned that the location of the hotel was too high up on the hill but that was not the case. My room was a corner room and I found both the room and bathroom to be on the small side.",5-Jun-13,4
"We had booked the accommodations by using points, and the Hyatt offered us an upgrade for a small amount of money each night. It was worth it! The room had a great city view, a large living room, bedroom and 2 BATHS! The room was recently updated and it was pretty cool. It had automatic shades in both rooms and the bathrooms were very upscale. One thing to know, the hotel makes a great deal of noise when it is windy. It sounds like an old house and can be a bit daunting being on the 18th floor. (It's because it is built to weather earthquakes)We had access to the concierge level, which is on the 32nd floor. What a view! We had drinks there on a few nights (reasonable prices - you serve yourself) and snacks. We also went up there for continental breakfast (included) and the layout was excellent. One tip though - get there early on the weekend or you might not even get a table! One day we had to bring our small plates back to our room which was annoying, but it happens. The service from the staff was superb, and we truly enjoyed our visit to this hotel.",4-Jun-13,4
"I had a great time at the Grand Hyatt. The rooms were recently renewed, nice and clean. They have a well appointed bar with live music, which is pretty cool. Prices are not bad during the happy hour.The location couldn't be better, steps from shopping, restaurants, bars and Chinatown. Bus lines and cable cars to everywhere in the city run from close by, metro station a couple of blocks away and a Starbucks for your morning coffee just across the street. So you can't do better than that :).",3-Jun-13,5
"No complaints! Excellent location, cleanness, great room service, wonderful view of the city. I've stayed at Grand Hayatt twice and it really was worth it. One Up Restaurant services a good breakfast. Teh menu colud be a bit more varied, but it was OK.",3-Jun-13,5
"We arrived for a 3 night stay in early May. This hotel is a short, 10 min walk from the Powell Street BART station if you decide to catch a train from the airport. We were greeted by friendly staff on arrival and the check in process was fast and efficient. Our room was spacious, modern and pristine and we were able to sleep in peace on the comfortable king size bed with no street noise noticeable from the 14th floor. The hotel is located in Union square so there are plenty of options for eating out, shopping and close to the SF tram cars if you plan on sightseeing. The cost was quite cheap and would be hard to beat from other hotels in the area. Also, If you plan on seeing the major sights in the city I would recommended the ""Hop on / Hop Off tour"" bus company as there is a stop just around the corner from the hotel in Union Square. We can't wait to stay at this hotel again. Thanks for a fantastic experience.",2-Jun-13,5
"The hotel is just one block from Union Square. All the staff is helpful, the breakfast is really delicious. Room 1108 is large, clean, and very comfortable and the office facilities are available inside the room. I strongly recommend!!",2-Jun-13,5
Arrived here on a Saturday and stayed until Wed. AM. It was a short walk from the Powell Street Bart! Check in was smooth. I had requested an upgrade to a bay view which was well worth the 25.00 extra per night! I had a view of the COIT tower and Telegraph Hill and the Bay! I was on the quiet floor on the 28 th floor. It was indeed quiet and I did sleep well. Room service as expected was pricey but nice and welcome after a long flight. The bonus was that I could enjoy it with my view of the Bay. The hidden gem was the coffee bar across from the concierge desk. It was quicker and less expensive than the Starbucks across the street. This is a tastefully designed property with gas fireplace in the lobby and shelves with books and potted plants. It gave one the feeling they were in a family room or a den. I would definitely stay again.,1-Jun-13,5
"I stayed 5 nights at Grand Hyatt and I felt really good. Big hotel, totally renewed and perfect for business but also for leisure. A lot of times is fully booked so its better if u reserve a room in advance. The hotel staff is really kind and helpful. Its my fav choice for my company trip in SF. Keep going! ",1-Jun-13,4
"Stayed in 2 adjoining rm w family, but as most connecting rooms, the other room has a 2 double beds and the other a king size bed, but since we needed 2 beds in each, they gladly provided us a roll away bed, which was free, so we get to be together during our stay.The service was impeccable, we needed to heat our food to go and they sent us a microwave,, we needed some tools to fix our luggage which got damaged, they sent us a handyman to help us, we requested for a late check out, they gave us till 3 pm for both rooms instead of 1, what a great service ! Will definitely be back next time.",1-Jun-13,5
"This hotel has a modern decoration in the lobby and rooms. Spacious room, the beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice. Staff was variable... check-in very confusing due to lots of people, but check-out was easy and got a 2pm late check-out. Breakfast was good, but the room was small. The location of this hotel is great. Very close to Union Square, with all the shoppings and restaurants nearby. I could go walking to Convention Center and to the other shopping centers. Cable car stop is 2 blocks away and Chinatown 2-3 blocks away. There was a Starbucks in front of the hotel, which was very helpful, since the frigobar in the room was empty and there is no bar on the lobby (the bar is located on mezzanine). Wireless internet was complimentary. I would certainly stay in this hotel again.",30-May-13,4
"I've stayed at this hotel a lot. . . even while it was being rennovated and some rooms /floors were completely closed, I stayed here. Funny thing is they never seem to know I've been there before unlike other hotels I frequent so I always get the intro to the property speech. The new check in area I hate because it's a three pointed star shaped desk which offers little privacy and there is not Platinum or Diamond check-in counter which is a bit annoying given my loyalty to Hyatt. I've noticed a similar trend at Marriott's recently. The other day I waited ten minutes to get checked-in . . .annoying for a frequent Hyatt guest.Anyway, the rooms are nice but the furnishings all look like they were sourced from China during the recent re-do . . . sort of a shame when Hyatt is an American company. I guess I shouldn't care but although the furnishings look modern they look somewhat cheap. The internet service is particularly slow here so I don't recommend paying for that and the water pressure out of the showers is the worst. You're probably wondering why I return again and again. The staff is generally very nice even though they seem to have no way of knowing I've been there countless times. The hotel is centrally located and convenient to many things. My bed is always clean and my sleep is quiet. On a few occasions, I've had to ask them to bleach the red mold on the grout in the floor but they readily and happily accommodate.",30-May-13,4
"Stayed 3 nights in the hotel, overall experience was fantastic, everything is a stone throw from the hotel. Staff were fabulous and very helpful, from the jenator to the reception tests to their management. Will diffenetly stay there in my next trip to SF.",30-May-13,5
"We loved this hotel for our long weekend get away!! The location was the best and so convenient to everything we wanted to see-chinatown, ferry bldg., shopping, cable car and great restaurants. The hotel had cookie decorating for the kids and our lil one loved it. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful. The concierge could use a little improvement. We will be coming back to the Grand Hyatt the next time we visit SF-can't wait for the comfy beds and the comfortable yet modern decor in the room and in the lobby.",28-May-13,4
"Here's my honest review...Pros:-Updated/Trendy hotel in the middle of pretty much every shopping facility you could imagine-Tons of restaurants within close distance-Excellent Housekeeping-Great city views (depending on your room)-Great Showers-Tasty breakfast (only breakfast)-Decent priceCon's:-Inconsiderate staff-The Valet representative didn't want to be bothered when us when we advised we would self-valet. Self valet is $32/day, hotel valet is $50/day, the self valet parking lot is literally right across the street, but GH has to give you a ticket for the $32/day rate...When I advised the valet that I would self-valet, he skipped past and ignored my vehicle without giving us a ticket-so I had to leave my car in an illegal parking space to search for someone to give me a voucher-Rooms are updated, but very small (inadequate cabinet/drawer space)-We booked a King room, upon arriving they advised us that we were booked for a double queen-luckily we had our reservation confirmation handy-so they quickly changed our room. It may seem petty, but this mistake frustrated me the most, because it was apparent they wanted to bump us to a less desirable room, although our reservations noted our stay as a ""5th Anniversary celebration"".-Checkout was 12noon, we requested late checkout due to our flight departing from SFO at 11pm, they were only willing to extend our checkout to 1pm...BUT HERE'S THE KICKER***A gentlemen behind us on line requested 3pm checkout, and his wish was granted...WTH???-As previously stated, the ""One-Up"" bar/lounge/restaurant serves a great breakfast-but that's it. My wife and I went for cocktails during the evening, only to find that our drinks were watered down. I opted for a Downtown Manhattan which bore a taste resembling a two-day old soda float with a hint of syrup...But who knows, maybe we caught them on an off night. Overall, this hotel gets two stars from me...check some of my other reviews and you'll see that I'm not a picky person. I've stayed at tons of GH's before, and this is the second one to disappoint me. Grand Hyatt's new business model appears to reflect Toyota's Lean Efficiency Process Method...But G.H forgot one major factor-They're dealing with people, not cars...",28-May-13,2
"Stayed for 9 nights April 2013 for conference in hotel. Had upper floor room with view. The room renovations are great - sophisticated but not intimidating. I slept better than at home. I found all staff very friendly helpful if a bit old fashioned. The concierge was very knowledgeable. Hotel conference facilities proved OK but are a bit claustrophobic for long conferences. Top floor entertaining area is spectacular. THE LOCATION IS AMAZING. The best city shopping location I have been to in North America. Close to public transport. Great for walking to waterfront, china town, museums, stadium.",28-May-13,4
"I was really delighted to have chosen this hotel to stay in on my way back to Auckland. Being a solo traveller for the first time it was important to have a safe, modern and clean hotel close to shops and restaurants and transport. This hotel ticked all the boxes and more. Recently refurbished, the room was super comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful. Free internet was available at the time I was there and it was very much appreciated. The hotel doesn't have a check in desk system, rather computer kiosk/desks manned by the reception staff. This was surprisingly easy to use and the staff were extremely polite and accommodating. As I was on my own I was given a lovely room on a great floor that was a designated quiet zone. They also have a hotel car to take you to the airport for not much more than a taxi. Wonderful. Perhaps the only things that let it down, and they are not not a big things, were the restaurant and that there was only a coffee maker in the room. There are travellers who like to make drinks other than coffee and a jug would have been appreciated. While the meals were in the restaurant ok they lacked a certain flair in flavour and choice. I didn't get a chance to try the bar but it looked great. Would I stay here again? Most Certainly! For the price I paid it was infinitely superior to a similar hotel literally around the corner. Well done Grand Hyatt.",28-May-13,5
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF for seven nights and had a King Bay View room on the 25th floor. The view from the wall of windows was spectacular (tip of Alcatraz, Coit tower)!I had used the web check in, so our check in was very efficient, and the bellman brought our luggage up to the room with us. He showed us the features of the room and got our luggage set up on stands - things that used to be common, but we find are lacking in many hotels today. The location of the hotel is very good, one half block up from Union Square, in easy walking distance from high end shopping, restaurants, tours, and cable cars and buses. We had not visited San Francisco before, so we had many questions, and the concierge team was outstanding! From maps, to helping us get reservations, to helping us plan our days, the men and women were uniformly gracious and friendly. There is a small coffee shop set up in the lobby in the mornings, with an array of coffees, baked goods, fruit, and breakfast sandwiches. The room itself was furnished well, including a bookshelf with 3 books on it. The room and bathroom were very clean and well designed. The housekeeping staff was also great - on our last day I forgot my ipod that was charging in the dressing area. As soon as we realized it, my husband and I returned ( about 1 hour later), and the ipod and charger had already been bagged and taken to security. Our stay here was a delight from start to finish, and we will certainly stay here when we return.",28-May-13,5
"I stayed at this hotel to attend a conference and got the conference rate, which was hight but not by San Francisco standards. The rooms were large clean and modern, with sleep modern furnishings. I loved the electronically controlled room-darkening shade. My room was very quiet (even though it was an only the 4th floor) but my travel-mate's room was noisy. The bed was comfortable. Although they did not advertise free in-room wifi they did have it, and when I had trouble connecting in the middle of my week there they connected me with an IT person who fixed the problem quickly. The thing I most appreciated was a REAL refrigerator with nothing in it, great for storing one's own beverages, fruit, yogurt, what-have-you. The location was very central, near public transportation and within walking distance of the Moscone Convention Center. Yes there were beggars around, but this is true all over SF, especially in the tourist areas. The bed was very comfortable and the staff friendly and accommodating. The shower had good water pressure at all times.",26-May-13,4
"I've been on many hotels for business this has got to be the better ones I've stayed in. I've stayed in many Hyatts and this one is better than most. It's been recently renovated and it shows. I had an upgraded room with a city view. The room boasted an awesome view with electronic shades and sliding panels. Everything looked and seemed relatively new. Room was very nice. Wifi internet was stable, reliable and fast. TV channels were actually in HD and not stretched.My only gripe with the room was the shower fixture and the water pressure. I don't know if the shower fixture was chosen based on being eco-friendly (this is San Francisco after all...) but the water flow pressure was ridiculously low. Granted I was on a high floor, but still it's just not powerful at all. It was a shower head wand that you could pull down, but when you turn it upside down and spray it upwards it goes maybe 2 inches tops (to give you an idea of how low the water pressure is). That coupled when you attach it to the wall, the weak stream of water forces you to stand close to the front of the shower. They definitely need to switch out those shower fixtures with something different. if you're going to have a low flow showerhead at least have it protrude further from the wall or make it a large rain shower head from the middle of the shower, not from the wall.I don't know if it was just my room that had the problem with the shower. Overall, the hotel boasts nice rooms and great ammenities. The gripe with the shower is not enough to not make me stay here again. It's close to everything, shopping, food, public transportation. Starbucks right outside. Self-assisted parking (you drive the car to the garage they park it for you / bring it back to you) costs $36 a night with in / out priviliges. For the price you pay for the rooms you'd expect high quality which you do get, I'm rating it overall a very good because the bathroom shower sucks. If the shower was better I'd give it an excellent rating.",25-May-13,4
"Having stayed in Grand Hyatts in Hong Kong, Bali, etc I was expecting something rather grander! This one is very ordinary. Rooms OK but not spectacular, breakfast OK but not fantastic. Best thing was the location.",24-May-13,2
"After about 13 hours of trans-Pacific flight, my hubby and I were welcomed with a free room upgrade that had the Union Square for our view. Nice touch for these weary but excited travelers. I would have given it 5-stars if the internet had a fast connection and was for free - a small thing to ask but a necessity for business travelers like my husband.",23-May-13,4
The best loction and nice rooms size. Just one block of union square! The staff are very helpful. The concierge help me to book all restaurants and activities. Very easy to checked in and checked out.,21-May-13,5
The Grand Hyatt is in an excellent position next to Union Sq and next to public transport connections. The food is fantastic and it has a good bar to have a drink in either before going out in the evening or to finish the day off. The staff at the Grand Hyatt and rweally helped us out when we needed anything which is more than I can say for Virgin Holidays.,21-May-13,5
"Lovely Hotel and great stay. We went to celebrate my daughters high school graduation. Everything was absolutely perfect. The room was beautiful, clean and very quiet considering the hotel was fully booked. The beds were amazing, like sleeping on a cloud! Steve got us checked in and he was great. Lyle helped us on several occasions and he was so kind and helpful too.We will definitely be returning!",20-May-13,5
"This is a nice very modern hotel. You do need to watch where you stay at in San Francisco and this hotel is in a good location. If you are in the city for pleasure this hotel is right around the corner from the where Union Square. This is where the Double Decker bus tours pick up from. It is very convenient. It is also walking distance to the big indoor mall, I forget the name. The rooms were very clean and had enough room compared to some of the other hotels I have stayed in big cities. Some friends that were in town were staying at the Hilton and Wyndham and this hotel was way nicer than both of them. The staff was also very nice. We had one small problem in the room and they arrived almost immediately after we called to resolve the problem. I would suggest this hotel if you are visiting the city for the first time.",17-May-13,4
"Me and my then-girlfriend stayed at the Grand Hyatt in the beginning of May. I called the hotel a few days before our arrival and informed them that I plan on proposing to my girlfriend in the room as soon as we got our room and requested to have a bottle of champagne and some chocolate dipped strawberries in the room upon arrival. The hotel was glad to assist and even set us up in a room with an amazing view of the bay. Rooms were very clean and spacious, staff was very friendly and location was great. And to top it all off the champagne and strawberries were complimentary. Many thanks to the staff at Grand Hyatt for making this special trip even more special",16-May-13,5
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt for a last night before departing back home. In a nut shell: You get what you can expect, and even a little more. Very friendly reception, modern & recently renovated rooms and a good view if you ask for a higher floor. I really would like to highlight the recently renovated rooms, the are quite nice in comparison to some of the more dusty places in SF. On a side note: The rooms seem to be a bit smaller then other hotels in the US, I didn't mind.",15-May-13,5
"Booked this as part of a package for a weeklong vacation. Had a bay view and it was great! Could see Alcatraz and the Bay....very nice. Room was a good size (king bed) and plenty of room. Entire staff was friendly and did a great job as well! Only real critique (and this is being picky) is the room could have had a better cleaning. The cleaning it had was more of a quick wipe down instead of a good detailed cleaning between occupants (dust under lamps, hair on bathroom floor, etc). Not a deal breaker, but kept it from being a 5 star rating for us. ",14-May-13,4
I couldn't have been happier with my stay at the Hyatt. It underwent a complete face lift in the last year and they did a great job. Cool and hip but totally comfortable. Rates are in line with most hotels in the area. Room was great with multilayer window treatments that you can control bedside. Fabulous bathroom mirror and lighting. Breathtaking view from the fitness center on the 35 th floor and the bar was a totally comfortable place to hang out even though I was traveling alone. They had an adorable singer in the bar and the food was delicious and not ridiculously priced. The hotel is conveniently located to shopping nd transit. I will stay again.,14-May-13,5
"The location is excellent, close to main shopping, Chinatown etc.Great views from the rooms.Not easy access by car - parking in front almost impossible, assisted parking around the block for 36 USD per 24 hours.Front desk staff very friendly and efficient.Design of property very poor - who would use rough granite in the hallways which creates a hell of a noise if someone is pulling any pice of luggage to the elevators. - room door had a gap of 1.5 inches!! towards the hallway - one could hear every word from  hallways.- our room had a connecting door to the room next door - they could have left the door - this is  an insult to any guest staying - we had a family with a child next door - impossible to sleep,  it felt like they were staying in our room.- bathroom faucet - which champion did design this? Impossible to rinse your hands.Overall a disappointing experience.",14-May-13,3
"This hotel is located right next to Union Square Park. A great spot for locals and tourists alike. You can enjoy a coffee or wine/beer with equal enjoyment. You are in the center of SF shopping. As for the hotel, I do not believe you could find a nicer room for the money in this city. Unbelievable for the price. The bar and restaurant are nice. The concierge very helpful. Other than two of the bellmen who seemed oblivious, the staff was top notch (two of the other bellmen/doorman were the best). You will not be disapointed.",13-May-13,5
"If you are looking for a well situated business hotel in the center of San Franciso, the Grand Hyatt is a very good option.Located around the corner of Union Square, you will find the most important attractions of San Francisco on short distance. Shopping facilities, China Town, even the financial district is not that far away. The harbor and Fishermanâ€™s Wharf is a little further away but is even in walking distance for an average trained person.The rooms are very nice, spacious and very clean. Of course the higher the floor on which your is situated, the nicer the view you will have over San Francisco. Nice about the rooms in Grand Hyatt is you can leave your toothpaste at home as this is taken care of by the hotel.But in general, good value for money.",13-May-13,4
"The property itself is nice and in a great location, but getting a good sleep is also very nice on vacation. All we heard were the people next to us (even using the bathroom), people in the halls at all hours, and doors slamming. Room was very average (small). Bathroom was a little awkward. Basically had to reach over the toilet to turn on the shower. The sink looked like a mini bathtub and took up the whole counter top. This wasn't very convenient for two women trying to get ready in the morning. The mini fridge only keep items lukewarm. Beds were not very comfortable. Did not get much sleep due to all the noise.",12-May-13,3
"This hotel is in a great location, within a short walk of Union Square. The rooms, which boast great views, are generous in size, well fitted out, and very clean. Service is consistently excellent throughout the hotel.The menu in the hotel restaurant is somewhat limited, but there are plenty of other choices nearby.We wouldn't hesitate to come back.",11-May-13,4
"I am more used to Grand Hyatt in Asia Pacific than in the US, therefore my comments could be biased.Here are the positive points:- Great location for visiting San Francisco, recently refurbished hotel- easy check-in and check out (the web check out feature is great)- very helpful conciergeArea of improvements:- More hooks and towel holder needed in the bathroom. There were only 2 tiny hooks - Food selection for the breakfast at the restaurant can be increased. Choice was very limited, although quality was good- The Grand Club lounge : The variety of the lounge breakfast should be improved. It was exactly the same every single day during our 6 night stays, same fruits, same smoked salmon, same eggs... And compared to Asian Grand Hyatt, the food selection in general (breakfast but also during cocktail hours) is very poor.",9-May-13,4
"I love sf and it was unfortunate that I had to stay across the street from the Grand Hyatt due to a company meeting. But I did spend what time I could at the Grand Hyatt's OneUP Bar and Lounge. The new look of their renovation is something every hotel should model. The service I received at lunch by the F&B Manager was over the top, making you feel that we were all old friends. I couldn't believe their buffet. Priced right with healthily choices to choose from. I couldn't wait to go back over at the end of my day to relax at their bar, unto known to me that they have wine Tasting every Wednesday in their beautiful lobby at no charge. Dogwood Cellars was very gracious with their pours and all stood around with other guest who were talking about their days events with one another. My best conversation was with an employee by the name Lisa. She was helping out in the lobby during the wine event. What stuck with me was how she interacted with the guest, making us feel that we were part of her extended family, she is one that you can tell loves what she does and does it well. My next time back to sf will be to stay at the Grand Hyatt and experience this special place and people.",9-May-13,5
"Excellent location, very attentive staff, breakfast was great! The rooms were very nice and clean. I guess my only complaint is there is not enough drawer space for clothes. Our tour group only stayed 2 nights so I just left everything in my suitcase. Also 2 suitcase stands would be nice; only one provided.",7-May-13,5
"It was such a pleasure to stay at this hotel! The room was extremely modern, yet very comfortable. The staff, from the maintenance engineer to the concierge, were very knowledgeable and friendly. They went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed our stay. This hotel is centrally located near Union Square and the downtown area. If you do not have a car, the local transport system can take you anywhere in town that you want to go. The Fisherman's Warf and Pier 39 are less than 15 minutes from the hotel on the #30 busline. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and look forward to returning as soon as possible.",7-May-13,5
"Great location. Rooms average size and clean. Came with family on a business trip. Hotel going through renovations in the lobby so noise level, dust and crowded lobby area very disturbing. Concierge desk constantly busy, unable to receive service in a timely manner.",7-May-13,3
"Location:Great location, half a block away from Union Square. Close to many shops, many restaurants, and 2 Starbucks on the same block.Lobby:Pretty cool lobby, check-in staff is not behind a counter, which makes it more personal. Great ambiance music and lighting. Cozy fireplace lounge where you can use free wifi while you wait for your friends. We arrived early, and were given a room immediately.Rooms:Rooms seem recently refurbished. They are modern and extremely clean. Bathrooms are spacious, well lit, and completely new. The curtains are controlled by a button next to the bed. They even have a list of items they can give you for free (things you forgot home like razors, etc)I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the Union Square area. I have no complaints about this property. Good Job!",7-May-13,5
"Great location, Union Square is a great staging point for tourist activities and shopping is seconds away. Hotel staff was very helpful, we had to rush a dress out for pressing and the concierge made it happen on check-in notice late in the day and they also setup a hair appointment for the lady at a local salon, VERY HELPFUL! TIP: Go up to the top floor, there are north and south facing viewing rooms that give you a spectacular vantage point of the bay & bridge and on the other side the Square",7-May-13,4
I truly enjoyed the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. I love to be in area where I can get around and comfortably see the city. It is a perfect location. Staff was friendly. We checked in quickly. Restaurant and food was great. Great lobby area for sitting and getting together with others.,7-May-13,5
"This is a very nice and upscale hotel. Best hotel location in SF , right in Union Square with Macy directly across the street.Very nice , recently renovated hotel . The location is so convenient being in Union Square so it is a shopper 's dream . China Town is only 5 minutes away. Lots of great restaurant nearby makes this hotel even more desirable.The only negative is the Valet parking fee which is steep ($40 per day). I would definitely stay here again .",5-May-13,5
Would like to mentioned that the staff is very friendly and helpful.Location of the hotel near union square is a very good starting point for different actions like shopping or sightseeing.Was staying at the Hyatt a few years ago on a business trip and this time came back with my family. Only weak point is that the restaurant on the top of the hotel is no longer there and the new restaurant is not very useful so be prepared that you need to go outside.,4-May-13,4
"This is, hands down, a wonderful place to stay. It's an enormous hotel but the service is wonderful, the location is perfect, the beds were amazing and the bathrooms were very clean. The hotel must be brand new, or newly renovated. Either way, it was a perfect place to stay in San Francisco, even though we were only there for one night. The fitness facilities were top of the line and my husband was able to have a great workout, like one he would have at the gym back at home. The room even has electronic shades you can lower at night by a switch next to your bed!I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco and looking for a comfortable and luxurious experience.",3-May-13,5
"This hotel is first rate! The rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful. I was arriving very late and when we arrived at 2:00 am the doorman was the first person to come to our car and greet us. When we got to the desk they knew who we were and check us in fast so we could get to our room. I had requested a high floor facing Union Square. We were placed on the 10th floor but had a great view of Union Square. Joanna at the concierge was so helpful in making reservations with us, and just taking her time with us to expalin everything.",2-May-13,5
"Beautiful right from the checkin area. You don't realize its lobby. Bunch of stand up booths with all gadgets welcoming guests! Welcome message with your name on the TV in your room looks good and and buttons to control curtains felt easy in the night rise it and gaze the city and sky and scroll it down while going sleep. Right next to Union square is both good and bad in its own way. You have Starbucks opp to hotel, Cheesecake factory to right side. Love it. You checkout of your room using your TV or web and you are all set to move. Would choose again.",30-Apr-13,5
"The Grand Hyatt at Union Sq in SF has done a nice update and travelers, especially those on business, will find this comfortable, well situated and reasonably priced. Ask for a room that overlooks the Bay and Alcatraz, really nice. Their updated exercise room is great!",29-Apr-13,5
"While I didn't stay at this hotel, I attended a conference event cocktail hour. The conference room was nice and spacious and there was a wide variety of tasty and unique snacks, including warm Brie, roasted red pepper tapenade, taro chips and an assortment of yummy desserts.",29-Apr-13,4
"If you are traveling on business, as I was, and you can swing the business package, I recommend it. The breakfast buffet, included in the package, is delicious and convenient, including lots of fresh fruits and savory items. (Otherwise, you are looking at a $30+ expense!) The other perks -- newspaper selection, shirt pressing -- can also be valuable. Plus the location is great: just a block off Union Square and only about 5-6 blocks from the Moscone Convention Center. Given all the restaurant and shopping entities nearby, this location is ideally situated. The rooms are all newly renovated and fresh. The bar is pleasant and featured live music the few nights I was there. The service was excellent. The fitness center on the 35th floor has a spectacular view. I recommend asking for a room higher up as an added bonus. I was on the 31st floor looking north with an incredible view of Coit Tower. I always kept the electronically controlled blinds up to enjoy the view!",28-Apr-13,5
"Excellent hotel - in fact one of the best I've ever been in. Everything was new and absolutely spotless, and did not feel at all like a typical ""chain"" hotel - apparently the hotel has been refurbished recently. Rooms are large and the furniture (which I could describe as an American-modern meets Scandinavian) made the rooms look and feel even larger. The beds were great as well - just firm enough to provide firm support and just soft enough to feel like sitting on a cloud. The staff was great - especially the lady at check-in that actually made me smile after 15 hours of flying half way across the globe.Strangely enough, even though Internet was supposed to cost quite a bit (9 or 14 $ a night, I can't remember what was advertised), it was available free of charge. I have no idea if this was temporary, given that there was a hotel strike during my stay or a permanent feature.On the minus side, there is no pool available, and, apparently, you pay extra if you want a room on the top 5 floors.P.S. There's a big ""air purification machine"", separate from the A/C, in the rooms. What that does (except noise) remains a mystery to me to this day.",28-Apr-13,5
"Newly renovated areas of the hotel. Rooms very comfortable, clean and quiet. My room was on the 18th floor overlooking Union Square. Location was very convenient to financial district and just about anything you are looking for. Staff at check in were so efficient, before I knew what happened I had my room key and was on my way. I was traveling on business so didn't have the opportunity to dine at the property as we ate offsite. I will be back to this property for vacation time and use the facilities at the hotel.",28-Apr-13,5
"First the great bits - the service in this hotel exceeded my expectation... By a mile. The bellmen were so helpful and welcoming - I have not experienced this kind of help even at the Four Seasons. Personable and friendly, the team went beyond what was expected to put a smile on the faces of guests. They even came out with a wagon of toys in the lobby to welcome some young kids to the hotel.Our car was broken into during our time in San Francisco and we had stuff -including a passport - stolen. But the boys were so good helping us out. Equally helpful was the front desk team and they even waived late check out charges in order to facilitate our vehicle exchange. We appreciated the great help the team rendered.And the number of staff they put in the lobby also made getting help (or the elevator) a breeze!The location is top notch. Overlooking the centre of union square and flanked by a bevy of department stores and boutiques, this hotel makes it a breeze to nip in and out.The thing that disappointed was the room itself. The appointment of the room was of a different quality from the Grand Hyatt rooms in Asia. Bathrooms did not come with separate shower stalls and the walls are paper thin. That means you can't count on a good night's sleep. We had guests waking us up just by closing their room doors and vacuum cleaners in the next room keeping us up when we were trying to nap. Basic amenities were also available only on request which was a bit of an inconvenience. The decor was also a bit schizo - gorgeous contemporary lobby with cool LED backlit sinks in the rest rooms but head up to the rooms and you will be disappointed with the refinements.I am however more likely to remember the outstanding service than the lackluster rooms. Well done Hyatt team!Ps: beware the parking charges in the garage. Parked using their offsite provider and it was still a small fortune!",27-Apr-13,4
"The interior appearance is now very stylish, attractive and up-to-date. The check-in staff were standing at pedestals with laptops rather than the usual counter. They were very efficient and friendly and the experience was positive. My room was on the 7th floor without a view, but the room was ideal in styling and function. The TV was on when I came in displaying my name and how to access the different functions through the TV. It was connected to a wireless keyboard and there was access to basic internet there or through WIFI for free. I found that a real and welcome bonus. The window shade is motorized, there is an LED reading light and the workspace was big enough with full plug in capability. So often you have to hunt for an outlet to plug in electronics, but there were plenty here. Along the hi-tech lines, the key is an RFID so there is no swiping; it works on proximity. The sink was a raised, elongated bowl; quite stylish. The restaurant, OneUp, was more like a chef-owned restaurant than what one normally sees in a hotel. The food and service were excellent for both dinner and breakfast. The location was close to many options for shopping and dinning. I was attending a convention at the Moscone Center. They had a shuttle bus, but it was a very pleasant walk there and back, and probably just as fast as the bus. I would definitely stay here again when in San Francisco.",27-Apr-13,5
"I love the location of this hotel (near Union Square, but away from the madness). I've stayed here many times in the last 12 years, for this reason. The renovations in the lobby, restaurant and bar are a huge win. Well done! Boa in the new 2nd floor bar gives excellent service, too. He recommended wines (and not only the expensive ones) and treated me so kindly.I stayed for 4 nights. Rooms are comfortable, and modern and cozy. They have bathtubs and refrigerators, which is a huge convenience. I requested a room that was ""quiet"" (*24, next to the housekeeping closet) and that was helpful. There is a fair amount of building noise from the elevators shafts and wind (?), but I was okay with it.",27-Apr-13,5
What a great Hotel. Positioned perfectly in amongst the action of San Francisco. Great service. Room was beautiful and roomy for 2 adults and 2 children. Concierge was so helpful in choosing the right tours to enjoy with limited tome. Looking forward to returning. ,27-Apr-13,5
"Hyatt usually does a great job and this one is no exception.They have nice rooms -- although pretty small.Unfortunately their rates and add-on charges are sky-high! Watch your hat and wallet!Parking and internet charges are exorbitant -- ugh!These hotels are going to eventually kill their golden geese like they didwith high rates for telephone service.Nevertheless this a great location with good service.Since my last visit, the remodeled the hotel and moved the top floor view loungedown to the 2nd floor. The beautiful views are now only available to conference rooms!Definitely not a smart idea! Businesses don't want their business meetings with distractions.Too bad... so sad -- we used to like this hotel.",27-Apr-13,3
"Spent 2 nights holiday w/c 15/4 on a recommendation from a family friend, who stayed @ G.H. Union Square Oct.'12. Check In quick/efficient; originally requested high floor Bay view but got 7th. floor street facing; however room was well appointed & quiet @ the end of a corridor.Good choice @ breakfast, including plenty of fruit in buffet. Staff were very helpful, especially one of the breakfast management team who printed me a map where to catch bus & number.Hotel location is good for shops, restuarants & transport. We got from Market St. to Golden Gate Park, Ashbury/Haight, Lombard St., Ghardelli Sq. & back to Powell Street at a leisurely pace, on a $14 Bus/Tram day pass! Not the cheapest in town, but ""you get what you pay for"". Used ""Super-Shuttle"" from SFO @ 2 x $17 plus tip. However, the hotel limo service to SFO, via Tom a friendly driver, was well worth the $40 fare + tip!",25-Apr-13,4
"Stayed for 3 nights with the family in a Union Square facing room. Since the renovation both the lobby (fire places) and the rooms are fantastic = new, nice and cosy. The location is great with about 20 meter to the Union Square. I would highly recommend it. We havent used any of the restaurants. Used the gym and its a nice high end 24 hours gym.Service was mixed. Friendly welcome, luggage to room took 5 hours and a call, despite no disturb sign house keeping was busy cleaning right in front of the door - every morning. 2-3 more slips. While there are two garages next to the hotel, these come at a price. Again, we liked it and would recommend the place.",20-Apr-13,4
"Stayed in the Grand Hotel for 5 nights without any issues, had a good view of the bay from my 24th floor room. Hotel has live music a couple of nights a week in the bar and can get quite busy, food in restaurant and bar good was disappointed with breakfast but grab n go breakfast service is good value and fast. Used SuperShuttle for transfer 2 and from the hotel, just under $20 each way and about 40mins. When I next go back to San Fran will probably stay in the Gran Hyatt again",20-Apr-13,4
Had occasion to stay at the San Fran Grand Hyatt on business and while the hotel is located next to union square in the centre of the downtown area and positioned in the heart of some of the best shopping you could imagine I found the area too noisy at night to get a good nights sleep. I'm not a light sleeper normally and was on the 22nd floor so the noise level had to be quite high to keep me awake. I also had an issue with the registration desk in getting charges levied that were not appropriate removed from my credit card. It took multiple tries to correct this issue and it wasn't until I returned home and contacted them via telephone that we finally succeeded in getting this money issue resolved.,18-Apr-13,3
"The service was impeccable. The staff was ready ready to accommodate our every need. Our corner room had a great view of Alcatraz and the Bay.It was Christmas in San Francisco and our location just 1 block from Union Square provided us with the opportunity to see the wonderful decorations in the area and explore the numerous shopping opportunities.Typical large city parking fees are exorbitant, so in order to avoid the $50/night, we did not get a rental car. We used BART to ride from the airport to the hotel as there is a station within 4 short blocks of the Hyatt. There are many good restaurants were within a short walk from the hotel and public transportation is readily available to most tourist locations.We have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the past 8 years and looking forward to another stay in the future.",18-Apr-13,4
"We stayed in the Grand Hyatt SF from March 13 for 2 nights. Our stay should have been longer but we cancelled to look for a nicer hotel (which we found at the Inn at the Presidio). Our room was on the 11th floor, with, as the bellman admitted, â€_not much of a viewâ€œ, but quiet. In fact the view was quite ugly, but we did not really mind this as we spent only the nights. What we did mind, however, was that the room was very dusty. Dust was everywhere, the carpet had lots of lint on it and the most dirty thing was the rail of the sash window (see pictures). The air conditioning unit was also very dusty and covered with cobwebs. As our little daughter had a nap and I did not want anyone to come up, I cleaned it myself.I let the frontdesk know about the dust on our second day and the room then received a thorough dusting. The furniture of the recently renovated (!) room was chapped, the bedlinens had fissures and the minibar was empty. Not what I expect of a four star hotel.We called room service for some mineral water and were asked if we wanted â€_lime or lemonâ€œ and if we desired ice. We said lemon and no ice...the glasses were delivered with lime cuts and filled with ice cubes.Air conditioning gives you a good taste of everything going on in the house, with breakfast and other smells coming through from elsewhere. As the windows in the hotel could not be opened at all we were a bit worried where the fresh air might come from. Even more so as we had been explained that the air conditioner only recycles and conditions the air from inside and no air is drawn from the outside. We thought this was impossible and asked the hotel to clarify...they never even bothered to call us again, even though they had promised.At breakfast I could receive some gluten free bread, but it was bland, as well as the overpriced omelette. The only good thing about breakfast was that the staff was very friendly and helpful. Of the two elevators accessing the restaurant, one was constantly broken. The drinks and food were overpriced for what they were.Really, there is nothing ""grand"" about this hotel, and the price is not justified.If you are looking for a nice place in SF worth of the money it costs, head to the Vitale or, even better, the Inn at the Presidio.",17-Apr-13,2
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt last summer for a quick trip to San Fransisco. The location of the hotel was great - very central and close to many restaurants and shopping. However, the hotel itself was slightly lacking. The hotel was quite busy and it usually resulted in 15 minutes of waiting every time we wanted to speak with front desk or concierge staff.The rooms were also quite noisy, resulting in pretty poor sleep quality. Noise from the hallways really reverberated through the room, and the sliding door in the bathroom also resulted in noise and light in the bedroom at night if someone used it.Overall, not a bad stay, just a few little things that could have been better, especially considering the price.",17-Apr-13,3
"Overall not a bad stay. They have updated the rooms which are nice but have not updated the windows. They are old single pane aluminum with next to no sound proofing. I was on the 12 floor and could hear all the traffic etc. including the whistle they door man used to call for a cab. I am from the city so was not to bothersome for me. If you are a light sleeper go for a much higher room. That being said I received a note from hotel management about high winds and the noise I may hearâ€_now that was a first even for meâ€_.bring back to the outdated windows. I did have some trouble checking in. they made an error on my reservation and the gentleman (Term used loosely) was rude, boarding on obnoxious. They lose a few points for that. There is now reason for front of the house ever to be rude to a guest. No pic this time, camera battery was dead and had no charger.",17-Apr-13,3
"We stayed here for 2 nights, the walls were very thin and we could hear every noise from the corridor. The valet parking was over 50 dollars a night, which we thought was very high! The rooms are minimal, functional, but don't consider paying for an upgrade to a view - it is not worth it. The breakfast was nice and kids under 5 ate free which made it good value for families.",15-Apr-13,4
The location is fantastic and the rooms are well-appointed and lovely. We had breakfast on the top floor overlooking the city. Excellent service throughout the hotel. The fitness center was larger than most.,14-Apr-13,4
"Newly remodeled lobby, great location, accommodating staff, nice rooms. Only issue is with the bathroom. The sliding opaque door was a pain to one and close and let in a ton of light, which was very annoying when others were trying to sleep",13-Apr-13,4
"Definitely lived up to the standards I would expect for a Grand Hyatt and especially true at the price paid. Not too high a price, given the location, but definitely not a discount hotel. The room was well-furnished and well-kept. I didn't use the restaurant hotel, but there were very good choices from low-cost to high-cost food choices nearby. I did use the health club and found it to be very well-equipped with a variety of cardio equipment; not as true for weights but I didn't use them anyway.The interior of the lobby is very impressive. Open architectual design with very interesting lighting",10-Apr-13,4
"Stayed here for a week whilst on holiday in San Francisco. Really great location and very comfortable rooms. Staff friendly and helpful.My only gripe was the noise from the interconnecting room on our last night. We were woken just before midnight by our neighbours returning and could hear their whole conversation which went on until gone 1am. This is such a shame as up until then we couldn't fault the hotel.Chose Hyatt because we stayed in a Hyatt when we visited Los Angeles a few years ago and that was a lovely hotel, so decided to stay at another Hyatt hoping that it would also be a positive experience. We were not disappointed. Thanks Hyatt!",10-Apr-13,4
"We picked this hotel for its central location, so we could walk to most of the places around Union Square. Check in was quite efficient. All the staff were very professional and friendly.The room was fine, bathroom was spacious with a big shower area, nice amenities. However, the lighting in the room was a bit dim to my liking, and the bed was too soft as it sank to the middle.There were complimentary ice and filtered water in a room along the corridor, that was handy to fill up our drink bottles.",9-Apr-13,4
"We had a lovely stay at this hotel. Initially we were quite scared as so many issues had arisen in a simple reservation. We had to deal with them for 2 full days. It was very frustrating. However they made up for it by upgrading our rooms. Overall, the hotel is very nice. Some may complain that there is no mini bar. We didn't mind as we never use the mini bar as it is outrageously priced. The rooms are clean and modern and nicely decorated. The location is perfect and staff is very nice. We stayed as a family and would stay again.",9-Apr-13,4
Location couldn't be more central and the service was excellent. Rooms are small but well designed and very clean. I didn't try the restaurant but the room service was good and moderately priced for a hotel in this category.,9-Apr-13,5
"Lovely 3 night weekend stay at the newly remodeled Grand Hyatt. Rooms are lovely, bathrooms are well designed and the employees couldn't be more accommodating. As a Diamond member, I really enjoyed the newly designed grand club lounge. Breakfast was well done as were the evening hors d'oeuvres and snack throughout the day. Location right off Union Square is awesome and you are right in the middle of a plethora of upscale stores. Definitely will stay here again when we return to San Francisco.",8-Apr-13,5
"Wonderful location, lots to see and do around the hotel. Hotel itself is average. Lobby decor is nice, but room decor looks very dated, even after their renovations. Bed was comfy, shower was very nice. ",8-Apr-13,3
"The Hyatt had a major renovation a few years ago and the rooms are now SO much nicer: very comfy beds, great views from the higher floors, and electronics to delight everyone. There's a large, built-in flat screen TV, lots of desk space, and bedside buttons to raise and lower the window shade. What I really appreciated was the LED reading lights on each side of the bed. The bathroom, too, received a facelift: ample lighting around the large mirror and a new, 21st century sink with nice amenities (even toothpaste!) Of course, the location is the best: right on Union Square. Even the lobby is more user-friendly. This hotel does tend to be crowded due to conferences, etc. but we weren't bothered by any noise. Didn't try the restaurant. Would definitely stay here again.",8-Apr-13,4
"I stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms with a gorgeous view and loved it. The room was really well appointed and very well designed. The restaurants and room service were all excellent, as was housekeeping. (One thing: One evening I had to cross a picket line to get into the hotel. Apparently Hyatt does not have a great record on paying and supporting its housekeeping staff, which is very disappointing, as I am a fan of the Hyatt brand.) If you have a car, the parking is very expensive in downtown San Francisco, but the valet parking is exorbitant. So, park at the Sutter Street structure catty corner from the hotel. It's easy and will save you a little money. The location could not be better. It is one block up from Union Square and three from the entrance to Chinatown. Shopping, restaurants, and the cable car are all nearby. On top of all this, I got a great price at the last minute! Would definitely stay here again.",8-Apr-13,5
"I spent three nights recently at this hotel on a weekend trip and I think the best thing going for this hotel is the location. I was able to quickly get wherever I wanted in the city either walking or taking public transit. While it is not in the central business district it is probably an ideal spot for business travel. I'm not sure I would call it ideal for families since the fisherman's warf and the other core touristy areas are a bit further then some of the more business locations. Also while the area is full of people at night and relatively safe there are a good amount of homless people around. Still, everywhere in the city was realtively easy to get to and I would not have had such easy access to all the areas had I staid in the northern end of the city. There are also a lot more stores and coffee shops then in the main business distrct. Chinatown is also walking distance.The hotel is very nice as others have stated on here. The hotel rooms are very modern feeling and clean. The front desk was a tad confusing- its more of a computer kiosk now then an actual traditional front door. The staff was very helpful and polite. The only person who gave me some issue was the curt individual when I went to get my luggage out of storage to leave. Overall this hotel is very well updated, has enough around it to give you something to do at night, and provides quick access to other parts of the city. It isn't the best for families with small children since there is a small sketchy element and the touristy spots require a trolley ride to get to.",8-Apr-13,4
"Nice city hotel. A bit of a rushed feel to it. The lobby is lovely and though there was an attempt to make it cozy it is still a bit sterile. The rooms were adequate, as was the service. With one exception. There was one consierge who just was so UNHELPFUL. She wasn't unfriendly, just businesslike. But more importantly she just would not listen at all. Everything I tried to ask for directions, suggestions, anything at all she would try and finish my sentence and assumed she knew what I wanted. And the thing is - she didn't!! I finally left the desk and came back when she wasn't there.",8-Apr-13,4
"The Grand Hyatt at Union Square has one of the great locations for people visiting for work or play. It's a short walk to the Moscone Center complex South of Market and in the heart of the Union Square shopping district. The only problem during the past few years was that the hotel felt trapped in a time warp of the early 80's. The rooms were dark - the lobby (unfriendly) and the lack of a casual place to eat or drink would make one wonder if this truly was a Hyatt.All of this has been changed with the recent modernization program. The rooms are now decorated in a fresh, contemporary style. It's electronics friendly - one can even plug a computer into the large wall-mounted flat screen. The bathrooms are better lit, too! The lobby is much improved - not a place to spend great amounts of time, but finally one can meet and have a conversation comfortably. The new ""open"" desk registration area seemed much more efficient and the staff was friendly and incredibly fast at processing our requests.On the mezzanine, the new restaurant and bar were above expectations - not a bargain - but, the food was certainly equal to the price!From a style/charm perspective, its unfair to call this a sterile hotel as a criticism. It's a Hyatt - it's amenities and services are consistent with the level of other major chains: no more, no less. Because it's large, it is very likely one can find a great rate through the major travel sites - and relative to the other hotels on Union Square, a cut above.",7-Apr-13,4
"Stayed 4 nights in this hotel . There was an ongoing conference in the hotel during that time so the place tends to be crowded in the lobby most of the time . I liked the location, which is very central , with the Union Square ( with many shops and restaurants) just literally a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel doorstep .I also liked the spacious rooms , well designed and presenting state of the art amenities, such as an interactive huge LED TV , which has a separate control pad , and the nice button control for the curtains. Beds are comfortable, lighting is good, although the bathroom is not that elegant (except for the basin ). Reception and the check in proceedings go smooth, the female front desk staff Jaze is friendly and so was Yena , who helped me secure my loss Hyatt Passport #. There are 3 great services that they offer 1) the complimentary drinking water (they have a dispenser ) provided beside the ice machine at every floor and 2) and the offer to provide needed amenities such as toothbrush , shaving cream, razor etc if needed. 3) the free wireless internet (but not that very fast at times ). Regarding the room by the way, I noticed the sound of the gushing wind although i can't say if the room was soundproof or not considering i was not disturbed by the voices of fellow guests during my stay there . i am not impressed by the breakfast buffet selection , the only thing i liked was the strawberries included , and the service by the coffeeshop staff headed by Danny. This hotel is indeed beautiful , and pictures may not be enough for the proper description . i would also like to commend the bell staff Jurgen and Angelito . Even the westin st francis and marriott present something more central in location , based on the services and facilities offered , i would still choose this hotel , and that is inspite i don't like the treatment (sarcastic ) I got from the male front desk staff when i checked out. For travellers out there , if you want points credited to your membership card ( Accor, Gold Passport , Marriott Rewards etc ) , don't book through Agoda, Expedia or travel agent , they won't credit it , even you paid it with your own buck . And last thing , have breakfast at the famous diner outlets in union square instead of the coffeeshop or starbucks (just in front of hotel ), you won't regret it.",5-Apr-13,4
"Recently modernized 70's era high rise near Union Square. Easy, hill free, walking to shops, Fishermans Wharf , Chin Town and Financial District. Rooms modern and functional. Good aircon. Showers, beds comfortable.Pros- No hills to climb . Rooms bright and modern. Conveniently located at foot of Nob Hill next to Union Square shops and restaurants. Mark and Joanna friendly concierges who can advise on restaurants, sightseeing.Cons - A convention hotel. Short on character and warmth. Wait for elevators can get tiresome if there's a large group staying. Restaurant small - gets crowded at breakfast. No store in the hotel so you have to go a couple of blocks to Walgreens for water. Surprisingly no turndown service.Sum up : $500 a night reasonable by SF standards. Everything clean and efficient. Has the sterile feeling of a hotel run by accountants. Certainly a Hyatt but not a Grand Hyatt. Probably wouldn't stay here again although we're great fans of the Hyatt brand.",5-Apr-13,3
"We are currently staying at this hotel. Although a great fan of the Hyatt brand, this hotel truely disappoints. The views are good from our 32nd floor room but it is virtually impossible to sleep due to the noise from the room next door.Unfortunately, we have a room with a connecting door to the next room and we can hear everything our neighbour does -what TV she watches, when she showers etc... We asked to change rooms to avoid having a connecting door but were told that the hotel is busy and the only other room was next to the elevator and ice machine - which could be equally bad. Apparently, a significant number of rooms have connecting doors in this property. The lounge is very nice although a little crowded. Club-level staff are very friendly.Overall though, a disastrous stay. We won't be back.",3-Apr-13,1
"Centrally located so you can get to just about every part of the city by walking. The service was friendly and attentive. We had a great room, comfortable and clean. It even had a refrigerator so we could store the cheese we bought at the Farmers Market. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because the beds (2 doubles) were a little soft and worn out. All else was good.",3-Apr-13,4
"I traveled here for business. Very disappointed in this hotel. Great location and nice modern rooms. But there was no mini bar in the room and no store in the hotel or nearby to buy amenities such as bottled water and soft drinks.There is ONE restaurant in the hotel that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Two mornings in a row, the small restaurant was full and I would have had to wait at least 15 minutes. The first morning, we walked to the W Hotel and had a wonderful breakfast there (I'll be staying there next time, that's for sure).The second morning I had to catch a plane, and after trying the hotel's restaurant for breakfast and being told it would be a 15-30 minute wait, I was forced to walk across the street to Starbucks for coffee and a stale scone.",3-Apr-13,3
"Check in was efficient and fast. Rooms were decent sized, and very clean and updated. Great location in the midst of Union Square. We got a great package that includes breakfast (crowded but not a big problem). When we were there part of the lobby was undergoing renovation, so it was a bit messy. And there was no proper drop off place for cars, just a makeshift door way at the back.",2-Apr-13,4
"So you are considering the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco? I say go for it. However, you probably want to know why. Firstly check in. I checked in from my office in Toronto on my day of travel. They have webcheck in and it is very convenient. We arrived in SFO at 1130pm so didn't reach the hotel until after midnight. The girl at the checkin was very cheery and welcoming - although given we had already completed it online, all that was really required was our room pass. We were given an awesome room on the 25th floor - expansive and modern. The bed was really comfortable and the room had all we needed. Some have complained about the sink in the bathroom - really not an issue. The room had remote control blinds that could be operated from the bed. Quite a treat enjoying the view outside. You can even order complimentary items for the room - e.g toothpaste, toothbrushes,hairspray etc. Other items such as shower gel and shampoo and conditioner were already in the room.The location of the hotel is excellent. It is about a 2 minute walk from union square - very safe and lots of people around (even at the late hour that we arrived). There are many shops and restaurants nearby, as well as the bus pick up locations for the sightseeing tours. We had not been to San Francisco before, so my husband spent a lot of time praising me for my excellent choice of hotel location!The hotel lobby etc is lovely. There are comfy couches where one can linger with a coffee. The concierge staff were also very helpful and knew a lot about what the city had to offer. Housekeeping was also excellent. Everyday we returned to a perfectly clean room - with no un-wanted rearranging of our personal items. If you want to work out while you are there (if walking the city all day is not enough) the gym is excellent - lots of equipment etc. Also fresh towels and water - not to mention the amazing view (the gym is on a really high floor).You do hear the occasional ding of the cable car bell from your room - however it is not really loud - it adds to the character. I had such restful sleep at the Grand Hyatt and woke up refreshed each day. Check out was also simple - you have a range of options - the internet, the interactive tv in your room or the traditional way with a person. You can also print out your boarding passes from the hotel lobby - I did that and it made things that bit easier. Overall a great stay, came back relaxed and refreshed and would most certainly stay at the Grand Hyatt next time I am in San Francisco.",2-Apr-13,5
"Great location and wonderfully updated, this hotel is a very good value in Union Square. Staff was friendly, room was well appointed and room service was punctual with good quality food. We had a standard room with downtown views and a view of Coit tower. Parking was available across the street and worked out well.",1-Apr-13,4
"Wonderful staff, great bar and restaurant. Reasonably sized rooms, excellent location. Recently renovated lobby. Asked for a top floor, got a decent 16th. No bad views: city or SF Bay. Priced accordingly, but got a discount over the convention web site. Will definitely stay again.",31-Mar-13,5
"My husband and I spent seven nights at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. After reading all the TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel, and most reviews for most other hotels in the same price bracket, I chose the Grand Hyatt with slight reservation. I'm a really fussy traveller. I used the hotel's website to pre-request specifics for our room (one bed, bath tub, high floor, view). This is the only hotel in our month-long trip that paid any attention to my requests. We asked for a Gold Passport upgrade to a bay view room, which the hotel kindly gave us.Firstly, the check-in. People who complain about the funky layout must be seriously jet-lagged not to figure out how it works. The layout means no lines and attentive service. The lobby is mod but relaxing. The bar equally pleasant. The room. Yes, the windows fog with the shower and you can hear police sirens on the 25th floor and the loo could be more sound-proof, but it was so comfortable and nicely laid out that we extended our four night stay to seven nights. Our view over the bay was gorgeous. The bed and pillows were heavenly. Housekeeping responsive. Room service really yummy. The concierge couldn't be more helpful.The location. It is impossible to find better. The area is safe and near Chinatown (wonderfully vibey), not far from North Beach and in the designer shopping area. We love walking (but aren't particularly fit) but could walk to almost any attraction within half an hour. All modes of public transport are very close. We love bars and music. Not into pretentious, but enjoy smart as well as grungy. Try the Tunnel Top (very close to the hotel), Vesuvio (Jack Kerouac's haunt) and The Saloon (has to be seen to be believed). The last two are a 15 minute walk (which helps one sober up if one has had too many margaritas!). This hotel is superb value for money. Not the cheapest, but worth the price. I spent days searching the internet for the best deal and couldn't beat the hotel's own website.",30-Mar-13,5
"spent 2 days over the weekend, in the heart of san francisco. parking garage is across the corner, no need to do valet. wonderful for shopping.upgraded to club floor which is very worth doing..great views and good breakfast with eggs, salmon, toasts, cereals, etc...will go back again for sure.",29-Mar-13,4
"after struggling with poor reviews of many luxury hotels in San Fran i finally settled on the grand hyatt union square. i have nothing but positive things to say, rooms were comfy, clean not noisey. room key always worked, breakfast with room deal was great and they will make you what you want if its not on the buffet!. staff was all nice and we were just happy in general with our choice",24-Mar-13,4
"First time at this Hyatt property. Fairly fancy and recent renovation was almost finished. Hotel was clean, as was my room. Hotel is a short walk to many nicer stores, and actually quite close to many different attractions in the area. Hotel has an excellent exercise area, if that is something you like. Rooms were a bit small, but workable. Internet was terrible. I was told I should have paid the 9.95 fee to get the ""upgraded"" internet connection, and the cost would have been removed when I checked out due to my member status. The rooms do creak when there is high winds, which is part of the building construction. Caught me by surprise the first time it happened. Staff at the front desk ran Hot and Cold. Might give it another try when I get back to see if things have improved.",23-Mar-13,3
We stay in San Francisco about once a month and always stay here because its right on Union Square near the shopping and dining. The recent remodel of rooms and lobby have really turned out nice. The hotel can be a little noisy on weekends but that is expected. Good value for money at this prime location.,22-Mar-13,4
"Short three night trip and it was excellent. Just off Union Square and in the heart of the City. Walking distance to much of the City and convenient to transportation and lots more.I was on one of the Club Level floors and access to t he Grand Club. Well done, good, attentive staff and very friendly.I have stayed at this property before and it was good but now that they have finished the renovations, the rooms are really very nice and most have good are very decent views. I was on the 32nd floor looking West, interesting. Not quite as spectacular as looking East towards the Bay but still good.Modern, clean, great bathroom. I was happy with my stay.",21-Mar-13,4
"The Grand Hyatt is everything you expect and more. The location is ideal for downtown San Fran. A good walking distance to the Pier, but great location for amazing restaurants and shopping all nearby. The rooms are perfect size and the beds are very comfortable. The rooms are decorated to modern times and the hotel lobby and bar are modeled extremely nice. The staff were all very helpful, friendly and most importantly, knew what they were talking about when asked many questions. The Concierge staff were especially helpful with tips and locations of restaurants, shopping, etc. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",20-Mar-13,5
"Stayed here in March 2013. The hotel is in a safe and excellent location, ideal for single ladies travelling alone. The beds are wonderful! I slept like a baby for 8 straight hours. The room is bright, intuitive and the amenities are what you expect from a Hyatt.",19-Mar-13,5
We spent 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt. The check in and out was very fast and efficient. We arrived before 9am and was pleasantly surprised to be offered our room then. The room has been remodelled and was large and modern with great views. It is the best location for downtown San Francisco with everything at walking distance or a trolly ride away. It is a excellent hotel and we will be back.,18-Mar-13,5
"Everything you could possible want to do in San Fransicso is right outside your door and either a short walk or a trolley ride away. The check-in was easy and a breeze. Modern lobby and check-in process. My room appeared to have been remodeled and was very comfortable and clean. High vanity in the bathroom, which i like and a nice large showerhead with great water pressure. The cleaning crew did a great job everyday. I was so impressed with the Hyatt that i came close to changing my membership from Hilton to Hyatt. I will have to stay at a few more Hyatts before i make that committment. The only downside and it is not the fault of the hotel but select a room away from the ice machine. for some reason guests seem to need ice at 3 in the morning. Decent places to eat surround the hotel and the front staff is very friendly and willing to help you decide where to eat. I live in DC so sounds from the street are never a problem for me. But light sleepers may want a higher room.",18-Mar-13,4
"We spent 4 nights at this great hotel. A fabulous central location just around the corner from Union Square, shopping precinct and all important trams.Our room was a great size complete with requested views across town towards the bay. Service was good, even though the hotel lobby was under renovation. The bar on the top floor was a pleasant place to watch the sun go down or the fog roll in, after many hours of walking the hills.There were many good places to eat, all within walking distance from the hotelHighly recommended for location and good value for money.",17-Mar-13,5
"Steps from Chinatown, the Financial District and Union Square, the location of the Grand Hyatt SF simply cannot be beaten,The rooms were somewhat updated although overall, I found the carpets in the room and common areas of my floor to be worn. I was on a high floor and noise wasn't an issue.I did get to use the gym. It was totally sufficient for a ""travelers workout,"" with lots of fresh water, towels, personal TV screens against a beautiful skyline view from the 35th floor.  I'd say this hotel was a notch above my previous stay at comparable hotel in SF and as an added bonus, the price was fantastic. Going to request this hotel next time.",17-Mar-13,4
"When I went shopping by phone for a place to stay in SF, I called the hotel reservations service through Delta. I needed to stay near SFMoMA and was undecided between the Marriott and the Hyatt. The prices were about the same but the Delta operator told me that the Hyatt was offering a ""complimentary breakfast."" That cinched the deal for me. When I arrived at the Hyatt, though, I was told no such deal with Delta or any other service existed. I explained that I had chosen the hotel primarily because of the breakfast. The people in reservations were kind enough to honor what I thought was the original arrangement. Classy behavior. I'd stay there again, as my room was clean and efficient, too. I wish I could say the same about Delta's hotel service. I tried to complain and never was able to reach a human being.",16-Mar-13,5
Newly renovated. Great location with excellent staff. Loved it. Union square over look was great. Was December so looked at Christmas tree and ice scaking rink. Checg-in was different - Computerized stations out incenter of area. Great Door and Bellmen - very attentive. Large room andquiye - good sleep. Going to be our Hotel in San Francisco.,16-Mar-13,4
"We stayed for a vacation and the location was spectacular to say the least. Room was clean and spacious. Service was prompt. Quiet space. The breakfast was a great price for what you get, I avoid eating in the surrounding area for breakfast for a family. The only issue is I wish had free WIFI in the room. Its hassle to have to go down to Starbucks or the lobby.",15-Mar-13,4
"I lived in San Francisco for many years, and when I come back for visits I always want to be around Union Square. I had avoided the Grand Hyatt because it was a bit worn out. But recently I stayed there and was pleasantly surprised at the remodeled hotel. It is beautiful! They have a friendly staff and you cannot beat that location. The views are gorgeous. I used Hyatt points to upgrade to the club level room, and access the lounge. This is a great perk if you are traveling with a family so they can get snacks when they want. The food in the lounge is really good.The one drawback about this hotel is that you can hear the room next door. We had a noisy neighbor who had drank too much. I called the front desk and the next thing I knew the bellman was at our door and they moved us to an even better room. Problem solved.If you are going to SF to shop, this is the place to stay. Take a walk through China town, then through North Beach up to Coit Tower. Its all easy to do from this location.",15-Mar-13,4
"He staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice location at the top of Union Square. Starbucks, 7/11, restaurants, shopping center with upscale grocery store, etc, nearby. Rooms have been nicely renovated Grand Hyatt style. Used to be a Hyatt Regency, I believe. The only negative may be the plumbing and bathroom. Low water pressure, shallow bath owing to the age of the building. Parking across the street for cheaper price than the hotel.",14-Mar-13,4
"My husband and I recently visited San Francisco for a long, romantic weekend. When I booked the Grand Hyatt, I was looking for something with a nice view and romantic amenities. They offered a romance package that included a high floor (aka view) room along with guaranteed late check out (3pm!), breakfast for 2 and champagne and chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival. The rate for all this was the same as the basic rate for a standard room at other hotels in the area so it was a great deal (I did have a AAA discount so that made it even better!).The room we stayed in was well appointed and very nicely decorated. The view - amazing! This is exactly what I wanted so complaints here! I will say the room was a bit smaller than I am accustomed to but it was so nice it really didn't matter.As for service, the staff went above and beyond. Our bellman has been around forever and had so much information to share about the area. He was so helpful.We asked if we could switch out the champagne for wine since my husband doesn't care for champagne. They said no problem. About 5 minutes after the wine was delivered, the room service manager called and asked if we'd opened the wine yet. I told them no. They said ""Good, I sent you the wrong bottle and want to upgrade you to a better one"". Honestly, didn't know what they were going to send and were happy they were willing to switch it out so a better wine was a plus.When we checked out, there was a minor mistake on our bill. They didn't ask questions, didn't argue, just took it off. I know this should be expected but in this day and age it is shocking to me how unclient-friendly some places are. NOT the Hyatt! Full client centered service the entire time!Overall, we had a great stay in a top notch hotel. I have to admit I was a bit sad they did away with their top floor restaurant but there are plenty of places in the area to get that romantic view with a nightcap.",14-Mar-13,4
"We got an early check-in to a wonderful room with a view of the city, Coit tower and the bay. Floor to ceiling windows and everything newly remodeled. Modern yet warm. The bed was comfy too. At night the city lit up like a jewel box.The location is perfect for exploring the city. the staff was so helpful and answered all our questions about getting around the city.",14-Mar-13,5
Grand Hyatt is right in the center of all the happenings. A few steps away from Union Square makes it totally fab. All the awesome specialty stores are right in front of your very eyes. Great restaurants all within walking distance. Be sure to wear your walking shoes and get ready for a great experience. Fabulous city views from this hotel and friendly staff. The breakfast is to die for.,14-Mar-13,5
"This is my go-to hotel whenever I have a business trip to San Francisco. The hotel is nicely located adjacent to Union Square and it's a short, pleasant walk to the conference center. The rooms are nicely appointed, and as long as you have a higher level floor, you'll get a nice view of the San Francisco skyline. Even if you don't, the gym is on the top floor and offers a great view. I'll also add that the gym is functional, if not small, but you can't expect too much being in downtown SF. Unfortunately, they no longer have a bar/lounge at the top floor which was one of my favorite parts of the hotel on my last trip. I also ordered room service which was good (I had the thai beef salad) reasonably priced as far as room service goes. I've stayed at the nearby W Hotel before and the Grand Hyatt is close to the same quality but a much better value.Other tips: - The paid WiFi is significantly faster than the free one so it may be worth the extra money - If you want to save some money and travel time, especially during rush hour, take the BART to/from Union Square. It's a very short walk from the station to the hotel",14-Mar-13,5
"A good location next to Union Square so it's close to shops, restaurant. china town, tram lines etc. This hotel doesn't have a reception, just men in suits standing over their lap tops. The room we stayed in was classed as handicap accessible and for some reason there's a large gap at the base of the entry door so at night it's like sleeping in the hallway. We had to put a cushion across the door at night to stop the light from shining in and everytime someone shut their door I would wake up. We also had a connecting door with no soundproofing, especially when the kids next door kept opening their door in fascination, and then, of course they'd slam it shut. As I've seen in other reviews the bathroom doors just slide shut. Actually our door had a 2 inch gap, it wouldn't shut, let alone lock. We changed rooms, had a quieter neighbor and a bathroom door that shut but still the same gap under the entry door. The bathroom was nice but the towels were placed on the handicap bar next to the toilet which had no lid. That's really unsanitary, they need to find another place to store the towels. Don't think I'll stay here again.",14-Mar-13,3
"The renovations complete, this hotel is excellently appointed and cared for. The staff is super helpful, the rooms are modern and top notch, and the views are great.The check-in experience is a bit different with several podiums in the lobby, allowing you to interact more personally with the desk clerks. You can also do a web check-in. My room some 25 stories up had a great view to the west that I could enjoy with a push of the button on the electrically powered shades. No broken curtain tracks and tacky sheers in this hotel. The TV had a good selection of channels and easily accessible input ports to connect to other devices. There were plenty of power outlets and an iPod dock on the clock/radio. The bathroom was excellent with stylish fixtures and everything in perfect working order.The fitness center is most of the 35th floor. It isn't the best in the city, but it has a great view and several cardio machines. The weight machines can get a little crowded early in the morning.The bar is nicely set up with fast service, however, it didn't have any light or simple appetizers available; only expensive and exotic choices. That will appeal to certain people and not others. I didn't try the restaurant. There's a Starbucks across the street.The hotel is located a half block off Union Square which makes it very convenient for shopping, access to the cable car, and several restaurants close by. It is a 10 minute walk to the Moscone. I hope to be able to stay here on my next trip to San Francisco.",14-Mar-13,5
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for an anniversary getaway. The hotel itself is very nice and well located, and our room, overlooking the City from the 33rd floor, was fabulous. But what really sold me on the experience was two instances of customer service.First, we arrived at about 8:45 pm on a Friday and I mentioned to the bellman that my wife was anxious to have some dessert. We were staying on the club level, which has dessert provided only through 9 pm, and he offered to go up to the club lounge and make sure they didn't put away the desserts before we arrived. Suffice it to say, due to his initiative, disaster was averted, we had a great dessert, and the stay was off to a good start.Next, the following afternoon, as we were about to head out to a show after a day of museum going and shopping, we received a call that the hotel had been trying to deliver a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary all day but we had our Do Not Disturb sign on the door. We quickly took the sign off the door and, when we returned later in the night, we enjoyed the unexpected and delightful gift, which made an already special occasion even more memorable.Bottom line: two thumbs way up for the Grand Hyatt.",14-Mar-13,5
"Rooms are clean, location is decent, and service levels are on par with most major chain hotels. They brought me ear plugs in the middle of the night - nice touch. But rooms were very hot/stuffy. Overall there are no surprises at this hotel. The bar is worth a mention; nice view, nice room - check it out if you are killing time.",14-Mar-13,4
"I recently had the pleasure of spending two nights at the Grand Hyatt located in Union Square in San Francisco. The room I stayed in was small, but nicely decorated. The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. Rooms offer a Flat Screen TV, and a refrigerator that you can use. (not one of those overpriced minibars.) The bathroom had a good shower. Lighting was a little dim for my needs, but may be acceptable for others. Towels were not as fluffy as I like them to be, but were adequate. The beds were very comfortable. I would suggest requesting a Queen or King bed if you are traveling with your husband or significent other. The double beds in the double double rooms are small. The Grand Hyatt Union Sq offers hypo allergic rooms which I found to be terrific since I have many allergies. These rooms have a state of the art purification system to cut down on pollents. In the rooms there is a card that offers several diffferent (forgot at home) items that are offered complimentary. There is also an additional list of items that you can use while staying at the hotel. If you take them home you will be charged for them. The reception area as you enter was extremely appealing. The public lobby areas are beautifully decorated and have a fireplace. The Concierge was very knowledgeable. Service in general was very good. Located in Union Square you will find the best shopping in San Francisco. There are quite a few very good restaurants nearby. I stayed on the Stockton Side of the hotel and I could hear sirens at night but did not hear cars going by or street noise. Perhaps there is a quieter side of the hotel that you can request. High floor is also better. There is a health club on one of the top floors of the hotel which offer a great view and nice equipment. It was a very enjoyable stay.",13-Mar-13,4
"I stayed at the hotel for a conference that my husband and I attended in San Francisco recently mainly because of its location and rate. After trying to select a hotel, I looked through amenities and prices and compared sites. Basically when you hear GRAND HYATT, you are expecting something really grand. However, the hotel is generally a nice downtown 4 star property. There is a fitness club on the top floor, free wifi throughout the hotel and complimentary water available. The hotel is very clean and has recently gone through a major renovation. The hotel's restaurants are quite pricey and may not accompany every palate. However, the location is right in front of union square and was very accessible to the convention center- although a small walk, the weather is great.",12-Mar-13,4
"I couldn't have been made happier at this hotel, the staff were attentive helpful and friendly. We rang from LA a day early and requested an extra night which they kindly accommodated and also upgraded us to a king bed. The newly refurbished rooms are beautiful. (I also stayed here in nov 2011, so I know what the hotel was like before).The rooms were clean and the king bed was one of the best I have ever slept in.The new ""one up"" bar is beautiful, staff were friendly. Couldn't have found a nicer place to stay. The location is perfect, especially if you want to shop. One thing I found amazing is that when I spoke to the concierge regarding restaurants she gave me a list of all the great nearby ones, all grouped by cuisines and prices, which I think is fantastic for a holiday. ",11-Mar-13,5
"Excellent choice for business travelers, it's 1 block off Union Square, close to shopping and restaurants. The lobby is nice and comfortable, staff friendly. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and well appointed, if a tad bit dated.Concierge was very helpful and made some great recommendations on dining, shopping, and even a haircut I needed.Can't comment on food. I didn't dine in the hotel as there are simply too many great options in SF to be eating hotel food.Probably a half step below an elite level, but I would definitely return.",11-Mar-13,4
"Friendly staff, breathtaking view (from the 31st floor), opulent (though expensive) breakfast, nice walk to the Moscone Center. I was recovering from foot surgery and the staff went out of their way to help with check in, bags, hailing cabs. Beautiful contemporary, spotless hotel in good location for shopping and site seeing. Room included cartridge-style coffee maker, awesome hair dryer, cable TV with all expected stations (local and national).",7-Mar-13,5
"We stayed at this hotel during renovations but it really didn't cause any inconveniences. Although the main lobby was in full construction mode, the Concierge and Front Desk still operated at 110%. The Concierge was extremely helpful for dining suggestions and overall day to day itinerary. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of Union Square, great for shopping and starting point from overall attractions. If you need to rent a car, there is a parking lot right across the street along with Starbucks if you need your daily fix!Our room was extremely clean, great view and didn't have any issues with noise. There was a weird odor the first day almost smelling like cleaning products but we didn't notice it for the rest of our stay.",7-Mar-13,4
"This is THE best HOTEL I have ever stayed at. The service was outstanding, visually the hotel is beautiful. The bar was excellent and had a wide variety of drinks, there was live entertainment both times we went into it. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable. This is the only hotel I will be staying at in SF. If you are thinking of staying at this hotel, book it right now!!",4-Mar-13,5
"Winning location. Room was fine. Nice view. Beautiful lobby atmosphere with fireplace and live music. Business hotel style, it almost likes other Grand Hyatt hotels all over the world. I had chosen this hotel, because of their brand and I am a long member of the Hyatt Gold Card. When we arrived at the hotel about 10pm, the front desk was so unfriendly until she saw that I have a Hyatt Gold Card. On the other hand, the concierge was pretty helpful, but for a couple of times we had to wait for about 20 minutes to be served, as nobody in charge in the concierge desk. I was thinking, is this really what you call a 5 stars hotel with service? We will be happy to come back but there are so many other good hotels choices in San Francisco, I definitely prefer to go to the other!",3-Mar-13,4
"At the outset, I should reveal that we (my family) are Hyatt loyalists and stay at Hyatts every chance we get. We find the chain to be a fair priced moderate luxury chain on which we can depend. That said, we have often stayed at the San Francisco Grand Hyatt at Union Square. For the last dozen years we've found the hotel to be a great property, with a wonderful top floor restaurant and reasonably sized rooms. The staff, especially the restaurant staff, has treated us like family. Well, at least so in the past. This hotel just finished a huge remodeling and renewal of sorts. The top floor restaurant and bar (with amazing views) has been moved to the second floor mezzanine level. The rooms have been ""modernized."" On this trip (late Feb, early Mar 2013) we had four rooms for our group. Every person in our group complained about the new rooms. The bathroom does not have a real door, but instead a sliding partition like door that is smoked glass. If you are sharing the room with another person, and you get up in the night to use the bathroom, the light from the bath floods the entire room, and because the door is just a sliding partition, there is no privacy -- especially with noise. People in our group ending up going to the basement level public bathrooms for privacy rather than use the room toilets. The rooms, at least the ones that two of us stayed in, are smaller than in the past. The new age modern look actually looks cheap to us, and we don't think they are going to stand the test of time. We can hear through the walls, and noise from the hallways is pretty loud. We don't remember this from our previous eight or ten visits (pre-renovation). And while the restaurant staff is mostly helpful (especially George, a 22-year Hyatt employee), we had hot and cold experiences there. One night our food was great, the next service and food were very sub-par. And twice we had to get new keys because the present key wouldn't work (that seems to be a Hyatt problem, despite what the very curt and condescending front desk employee tried to lecture me about). It wasn't hard to get new keys, but the employees seemed very troubled or put-off by evening being asked to make new keys. Although we've stayed here so many times, we probably going to start exploring other S.F. properties for a new favorite. We'll still stay in Hyatts in other cities, but likely not in S.F.",2-Mar-13,3
"My husband and I stayed here at the end of July 2012 for 4 nights. We had a town car bring us to the hotel from the airport and the hotel staff are excellent if you need a car or other transportation. There was renovations happening in the lobbey however despite this check in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly. We didnt notice much noise coming from the construction. I thought the price per night was very reasonable compaired to other modern hotels in the area. Our room was located on the 22 second floor and we had a view of the city and of Alcatraz, I thought the room was a very good size, the closet was big enough for me, and automatic blackout shades are a must in hotels now a days. The bed was comfortable too and there was a bonus area between the bathroom and bedroom which I thought was great. The restuarant on the 36 floor was good, the breakfast is better up there then ordering room service for almost the same price. The hotel is located right on Union Square so you can walk around at night and have something to see. We walked to AT&T park so anything is walking distance for us!! Overall I would stay here again.",2-Mar-13,4
"Have stayed here three times in the past six months, as the renovations have progressed, have been blown away each and every time by what a first class job this property had done in recreating itself as a contemporary but service oriented property. Feels on a par with a Four Seasons, service is exceptional, physical renovation is fantastic, common areas are beautiful and upscale, the rooms are first rate and hi tech without being over the top. Food all around is great, and the gym has one of the best views you'll ever see. Staff all first rate, especially Tiffany, who helped me with last minute changes and was top notch in how she handled everything.",1-Mar-13,5
Very friendly staff and gorgeous rooms. Comfortable beds and good reviews. In the middle of good shopping.Only negatives are that the toilets are uncomfortabke and there's only power on one side of the room. Bring an extension cord.I would stay here again.,26-Feb-13,5
"The new lobby looks great! What made my stay special was the service I received from your staff. When I arrived, I realized I forgot my collar stays. This is not a huge deal, but still it bothered me. I asked at the desk for a set and expected to receive some plastic stays which would have been great. What i received was a complete set of metal stays from Nordstrom. What this does is make me feel wanted, like you want my business again, which as a result you will have!",26-Feb-13,5
"Stayed here for couple days, for business. Requested for room facing Union Square (it's right beside it) because I wanted to see the goings on. Perfect location if you want to be close to the shopping and couple blocks from Chinatown. I'm not bothered by noise so room was great! If you are a light sleeper, you will need ear plugs. I was able to hear street noise 12 floors up. You can block out light with the shade. If you're taking Bart from the airport, exit at Powell but its a few blocks walking along Stockton St. And you'll have to lift carry on bags up flight of stairs from subway. There was a lot of stores along the way so if you travel light, the walk is not a problem. Bed was comfortable, room was clean and had modern furnishings. I like the leather touches. I like the bed lights and selection of tv channels. Bathroom was clean, had spa scented toiletries. Love it! I don't understand why the negative reviews on the sliding door for the bathroom, I thought it was genius. Space saver.Felt safe walking around, even through Chinatown. Great cheap food around there, and great pastries. Moon cake and steamed pork bun, yum! I did eat at king of Thai at recommendation of front desk. If there's 2 of you, then the portions are good enough to share and get 3 dishes in total. Food was alright, had pad Thai, and papaya salad.Concierge was great. Recommended restaurants for Embarcadero, which was about 45 minute leisurely walk from hotel. There is cable car that you can take there, about $6 one way. Concierge also arranged for an airport shuttle pick up.I would stay here again if money was not a problem. It was about $179/night when I stayed in Feb.Fitness room was awesome if you go early. Great views!",25-Feb-13,4
"We love Hyatt hotels, but usually stay at the Fisherman's Wharf hotel when in San Francisco. Although we still prefer the location on the Wharf, this hotel was really amazing inside. We went during the Christmas season and they actually had it snowing in the lobby! The layout of the hotel and it's lobby is quite breathtaking, and the service was excellent. They checked us in hours before check-in and offered us numerous upgrades. It ""is"" Downtown, however, and some of the area is a little sketchy (vagrants, etc.).",25-Feb-13,4
My wife and I spent a couple of nights here on a quick trip to SF and we were impressed with the recent renovations to the lobby and the rooms. The fireplace-library themed decor in the lobby was very warm and cozy. We also liked the closer interaction with the reception as they did away with the traditional bulky registration counter. The rooms are also very well appointed and modern. Downside is the acoustics. Granted the hotel can't do much about inconsiderate and loud guests but banging doors and hallway voices were way too audible. I'm hoping they can do something to improve acoustics. We also remember this hotel having a rooftop restaurant before but either that's gone or is still under construction. But this is San Francisco so finding a good restaurant is never a problem.,21-Feb-13,4
"Great rooms, good technology, warm and hospitable decor on entrance. The room amenities are well chosen and very unique. I like the throwback colours after the recent renovation. By far the fastest internet I've experienced.",21-Feb-13,4
"We stayed here two different nights this past President's Day weekend (on the front and tail end of a Sonoma vacay) - so my review is about two different rooms.First, I want to commend the front desk for being super helpful and so friendly. Both times, the check-in process was a breeze! For the first part of our stay, we arrived early (very very early!) and didn't expect to have our room ready. We were right -- our room wasn't available yet -- but they gave us a room to stay in while our real room was getting ready. Amazing. The front desk called us when our club room was ready a few hours later and all we had to do was switch the keys. Fantastic. Our first (real) room was a club level room (I used a platinum reward to upgrade). So lovely! Buttons when you enter the room to turn the lights on and have the shade rise; and to turn off all the lights and tv, etc. when you leave. And buttons right next to the bed to turn off all the lights; turn on the night lights; draw the shade down, etc. The room is super clean and modern, with nice wooden floors. Bathroom had a nice shower with glass doors. I LOVED this room and if I had only stayed in this room I would have given this place 5 stars all the way. The second room we got after we returned from Sonoma was a regular room on the 20-something-th floor. It was noticeably less-nice than the club floor (totally expected) -- without the little buttons, and with regular carpet and a bath with a shower curtain. This was all fine because I wasn't expecting the same little luxuries we got on the other floor. The only thing is that this room was LOUD! Like really really loud. We could hear our neighbors (singing!), the ice machine (across the hall!), the air conditioner, and street noise. Gym was nice and clean, with towels and water. :) Location is sooo nice if you love shopping. To give you an idea, it's right behind the flagship Levi's and Tiffany on Union Square. There are 2 Starbucks within 1 block that sell pastries from La Boulange. Yum!",21-Feb-13,4
"We usually stay at the InterContinental on Howard, but we were looking for a bit more central location this trip, so we booked here. Wasn't sure what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised. Our room on the 17th floor was newly refurbished and pretty spacious for a city hotel room. Bathroom was also recently redone and very nice. And the supplied coffee for the coffee maker is actually decent! (But there's also a Starbucks right across the street.) The gym on the 35th floor is greatâ€”floor-to-ceiling windows, brand new machines, decent weight selection. It's a bit small, but I'd take new machines over space. The main lobby/bar areas are nice, though as others have noted, the menus are limited. Location near Union Sq. is good, although busy, and there are a number of car rental places right nearby. We will definitely be booking here again.",21-Feb-13,4
"Stayed here for 3 nights on a recent trip to SF since the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero was waaayyy too much money for my dates. I had never been to the GH, so it was a chance to compare. The location is good, as it is right in Union Square, and is walking distance to several areas, like Chinatown, the Embarcadero, Little Italy, etc. They recently renovated the hotel, and apparently the lobby has been redone. Check in is a very open area with a few desks placed in an open room, without specific ""lines"" or counters. Honestly, I found it a little disjointed and inefficient, especially if there are a lot of people waiting. The staff were friendly and helpful. The club lounge was decent, offering standard cold breakfast items, and a hot egg dish every morning. Nothing terrible but nothing to write home about. We had a great view from the 32nd floor, and the room itself was adequate. A little cramped, but nicely decorated, with wood panels and soft, comfortable beds. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was adequate in size and pressue. Overall, the hotel is nice and I had no complaints. I must say that overall I prefer the HR Embarcadero, just because I like the location better, and the slightly easier access to transit, plus I like the look of the hotel and view from the lounge more there as well. If the GH were markedly cheaper again, like it was this time, I would definitely stay there again.",21-Feb-13,4
"After staying at a subpar Hyatt the prior week, I was a bit pessimistic about frequenting another Hyatt. Not only did this location meet expectations, it exceeded them. Rooms are beautifully done and very modern. I was pleasantly surprised with the overall quietness of the room given prior reviews. Plus the location right near Union Square can't be beat. I would gladly stay here again.",20-Feb-13,4
"We had a suite on the 33rd floor with a remarkable view of the city. The room was nicely appointed and very tastefully-decorated. My only complaint was the heating and cooling in the sitting area. The thermostat would not stay on our chosen temperature. We had to continually reset it. Other than that, the coffee maker was nice, and the bed was comfortable. I especially liked the vanity area in the bathroom.The location is perfect, just off Union Square and a couple blocks from Chinatown. We walked everywhere we wanted to go.An odd thing for San Francisco, but the room service clam chowder was not good, and they didn't have the bread bowl offered on the menu.",20-Feb-13,4
Arrived via taxi and the conceirge abused our cab driver quite aggresively as he parked - not super professional. Got a tiny room on level 9 with no view (924 - for sake of avoidance). It was the only room on offer when we checked in. Air conditioning was very loud but couldn't turn it off due to warmth of room. Got an adjoining room (not requested) and the guests next to us had a baby who cried most of the night. No mini-bar so no bottled water on offer. No amenities apart for cheap shampoo and shower gel - everything else was on request. Bed was very comfortable. Maybe we just had a crap room and experience but next time I would choose a smaller more luxurious hotel. This place is very average overall if you get a average room.,18-Feb-13,3
"The hotel has been renovated in recent years. Room was fresh and modern, big uplift from the last time I stayed here about 6 years ago or so. Comfortable bed. New furniture. Bathroom modern and new. Couldnt hear the neighboors, no rattling air conditioning, none of the usual US hotel nuisances. Free wifi throughout, which is great (and which was working reliably). The location is excellent: right next to Union Square. Excellent shopping and rest of the city easily accessible from here. The big negative: $45 for valet parking per day...what a rip off. The restaurant on mezzanine floor is ok, but the menu was quite limited. All in all, much improved from previous stays and pretty unbeatable location.",18-Feb-13,4
"I got the 'refurbished' package deal - a lovely room on the 25th floor. Not quite a view over Union Square (and the hotel is actually one block away from the square itself) - but a good one, nonetheless.Bed - good/comfy/great pillowsWifi - free low speed, pay for higher speeds - so you can get your email without paying, but if you want to stream Netflix or play games you have to pay for it, Seems reasonableBathroom - high quality (although had to ask for a bathrobe). Even got complimentary toothpaste!Gym - not huge, but good quality machines/weightsrestaurant - didn't quite live up to the rest of the hotel. Looked good, but menu was a little limited, especially for breakfast.staff - everyone was very helpful",18-Feb-13,4
"First time visitors to San Francisco and although a high level room was requested at time of booking so we could have a view of this wonderful city we were disappointed to learn we had been given the 5th floor. However upon asking at check in if a higher floor was available our request was granted if we could allow for a later check in time and within half an hour the room was ready on the 19th floor. (Thanks Ryan for going to the trouble). We were delighted with the room. Spacious, clean and every amenity you could ask for was available. Concierge was more than helpful (thank you Mark for all your recommendations) so that we could make the best use of our 3 nights here.Hotel is situated perfectly to all kinds of attractions and easy walking distance to many. A great stay and would highly recommend. ",17-Feb-13,4
"Stayed here for two nights over Valentines Day/Presidents Day weekend 2013. We stayed in a Grand Club room on the 31st floor, with a view of the city and it's beauty. Well appointed room, huge bathroom and comfy bed. Loved the electronically controlled window shade and the large shower. (The toilet is super loud! haha, it was like a plane taking off the first time we flushed it)The Grand Club lounge was on the 32nd floor, with a gorgeous view of the city and the bay. Cold drinks, ice, coffee, little snacks are available all day (and a welcome respite!) with a continental breakfast and appetizers/dessert in the evenings. Concierge helped us with a walking map and amazing place for breakfast our last day. Use them for any of your trip needs.The bar on the mezzanine level is really good, with decent drink selection. I liked the Moroccan cosmo, it had a really good spice taste to it. The special Valentine's Day drinks weren't my thing, but it's cool they tried to cater a view drinks to the day. We took BART from SFO to Powell St., then walked several blocks to the Grand Hyatt. It wasn't long, but there is a lot of construction going on and that last block is up hill, so be aware with your lugging your luggage. From SFO to Powell St. on BART, it was $8.10 and took about 30 minutes. We did take a taxi back to SFO, it took about 20 minutes (with no traffic) and was $45.Plentiful taxis in front of the hotel, a Starbucks across the street and Walgreens around the corner. Really good location!Definitely consider staying here!",17-Feb-13,5
"We booked a 3 night stay at this hotel, specially due to its great location.It is half a block to all shops and restaurants you could ask for.At check in, we were offered an upgrade to their Club, by paying a fee. It was totally worth it since included internet, breakfast and snacks.Our room was recently renovated and with breathtaking views from the Bay...the only shame is that they didn't have a king size bed room, so we took double beds for the view.This is an excellent option in San Francisco, for sure!",15-Feb-13,4
"I had stayed here years ago and hated it. I stayed here this time because of corporate requirements. A great location (even better than in the past due to build up). Great view, though I would have preferred a quieter room. Food at restaurants better than usual for a hotel. Housekeeping just okay. Fridge in room is TINY-- may not matter to all, but I could barely fit two containers of fruit. Love that you can open the window/door for fresh air. ",14-Feb-13,3
"Last minute trip with a friend, couldn't have asked for a better location for a first time visit to San Francisco. Centrally located whether you choose to explore on foot as we did (we went as far as the Golden Gate), or if cable cars and transit are your preference. Nicely renovated, friendly staff. The reception area is rather odd, not sure what they were going for but if it's a busy time it's a rather confusing set up. On weekends very LOUD music from the lounge/bar fills the entire lobby area. Felt like we were entering a nightclub as opposed to a hotel lobby! Rooms are very comfortable however windows are very thin so if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs! We were on the 31st floor and the noise from the street and Union Square could be heard loud and clear and our room wasn't even facing the square. That was the only drawback but with earplugs all was good! Would definitely stay again on a future trip.",14-Feb-13,4
"This is a wonderfully located and newly refurbished hotel. Situated at union square, it is in walking distance to all of the great shopping places. The hotel has been recently done up, the rooms are spacious and modern and the bathrooms are lovely. Downstairs lobby is groovy and inviting. The staff are wonderful and friendly. Would definitely return here and was a very pleasant stay.",13-Feb-13,5
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco sits on a northern corner of Union Square in the city centre, so the location is excellent for all that the city has to offer. During my stay, I think the lobby was being renovated as it was quite small for the size of the hotel and was also not particularly in keeping with the style of the rest of the hotel, as it looked a little dated. The hotel has been renovated with light, bright walls and modern, wood effect surfaces. Itâ€™s pleasant and inoffensive. The room was of moderate size, very clean and had the most fantastic view of the San Francisco skyline. The bed was firm and comfortable. Lighting and curtains were controlled electronically. The bathroom was of moderate size, had a lovely modern white suite. Toiletries provided were the Hyattâ€™s own brand, Portico Spa, which I REALLY donâ€™t like! I wish Hyatt would change these, perhaps provide a nice branded set? The rooms provide high quality, comfort and good value for money. I had received a voucher as my partner is a member of Hyattâ€™s points scheme that enabled me to upgrade my room from a standard to a Grand Club king. This allowed access to the Grand Club lounge that offered drinks throughout the day including coffee (lattes too!), tea and bottled water. Food was also provided at breakfast, mainly continental offerings but one hot option was available each day and pre-dinner time hors dâ€™oeuvres and desserts. Everything in the lounge was of a very high quality and having access really enhanced our stay! It was lovely and the lounge had the same fabulous views as the room. The extra cost for the Grand Club room may be worth your while, or alternatively join Hyattâ€™s scheme and start racking up points when you stay, you might get the voucher too!! The hotel unfortunately doesnâ€™t have a swimming pool, which is a shame. The Grand Hyatt San Francisco provides exactly what should be expected from high quality hotel chain. This hotel is far superior when compared with the Hyatt Fishermanâ€™s Wharf, which I found was very underwhelming at a previous stay. I would certainly recommend the Grand Hyatt San Francisco and will consider staying again, when in the area.",13-Feb-13,4
"Awesome view room of Union Square was perfect for my three night stay. My room was newly renovated and modern in design. Aside from some odd design features, I appreciated the remote controlled blackout window shade. I liked the morning coffee and pastry bar in the lobby. This bar's staff was helpful, cheery and professional. It was quick and easy. Requested synthetic bedding after checkin which was delivered pronto! Thank you.",13-Feb-13,4
"The Union Square location was perfect for us, lots of shopping and of course the green area where we could walk our dog. The hotel has recently been remodeled so the rooms are very nice. My only complaint would be that hotels now seem to be putting in non-doors to the bathroom. By that I mean these sliding things that just don't close properly which translates into not as much privacy as one would like. So I vote for real doors hotel architects - not too much to ask for I hope. But back to the review - these folks could not do enough for us. We had our dog as I mentioned which can present some dining challenges but they did not have a problem serving us in the lobby seating area which was great. Nice couches and a couple fireplaces and bookcases - so somewhat homey and comfortable. The next night we had some friends join us for dinner and because of the number - there were 6 of us - they gave us a private dining room so Bernie (our dog) could join us. I had no problem with the bed and I usually have issues. Also room service in Union Square? Yeah you better be prepared to drop a bundle on that as in any nice hotel there, but there is a nice coffee bar with some cereals and muffins in the lobby that is a lot cheaper.",12-Feb-13,4
"So, my point of view is from that of a mom with 4 month old twins. Here is what I loved:*the location was great! There is lots of shopping, things to do and public transportation within walking distance - and, for those of you who need it like I do, there is now a TARGET on Mission and 4th!! A ten minute walk away!*the staff was, with few exceptions, incredibly kind and helpful - front door staff, particularly, but everyone I interacted with was pleasant*loved the view from my 21st floor room*our king size bed was one of the BEST beds I have ever slept in, bar none. Super comfortable*towels were nice and big*concierge service was very good - we talked with them almost every day and they were very accommodating with our special needs :)*I liked the electric shade over the window to block out the sun during the day - it really helped because the room could get really hot in the mid afternoon in the sunshine*Loved the tv you could watch hulu and netflix on! Once we figured out how to work it and tech support did an update, we could watch our shows on the big screen*room was very cleanparts that were not as awesome:*the sliding bathroom door was fine for us with babies, but would've been really annoying had my older children been there - we couldn't figure out if there was any way to lock it?*we paid for the premium internet and it was pretty lame - like, almost completely unusable much of the time. My husband spent a lot of time on the phone with tech support but it was really frustrating. They did refund a good part of our money but I would've rather had working internet*the little fridge in our room did NOT get very cold, just cold enough to keep things from spoiling but not the kind of cold I like the milk in my cereal :). And it is quite little, we kept a few containers of yogurt, a 1/2 gallon of milk, a big of carrots and a baby bottle and that was about it. *one of the portacribs we'd requested was a nice Graco playyard - but the second was an old metal portable crib. I decided to use it since one of my babies doesn't move at all at night but had he been a mover, I would've requested another playyard. If you do request a playyard, I'd bring your own sheet from home because they didn't have one that size *you can't set the thermostat lower than 65, at least we couldn't in our room, and that midday sun really did heat up the room and the a/c couldn't even keep it at 65another tip: use the parking garage across the street on Sutter - you can pay the daily rate through your hotel bill (significantly cheaper than the hotel valet) and I always got my car right quick, friendly staff too",12-Feb-13,4
"Are you kidding me! The room had these expensive sinks and lots of money spent on hard surfaces but the most uncomfortable bed ever!!! Old, lumpy mattress with scratchy sheets and no warm comforter. We sleep in the room- up dating your uncomfortable- worse EVER MATTRESSES WOULD GO A LONG WAY. If you want to get rest in your hotel room- stay somewhere else. Absolutely unacceptable!!!!",11-Feb-13,1
"The Grand Hyatt is generally a very solid hotel. While we were largely satisfied with most things during our stay, there were, unfortunately, a whole series of little issues and inconveniences throughout that tended to take away from our experience. We want to emphasize up front that on balance this is still a very nice hotel â€“ centrally located, clean, and modern - but it could certainly benefit from a little more focus on its process and policy details. Things actually started off very well. Upon check-in we were voluntarily upgraded by the very friendly reception staff to a nicer room with a bay-side view â€“ which we really appreciated. However, while the room was nice and clean and had a very nice view, we quickly encountered a number of minor issues. For one, the in-room safe battery was dead (quickly fixed when reported). Secondly, the light switch did nothing (not sure if by defect or design), to the point that any light source had to be turned on manually during our stay (i.e. turn on each lamp separately). This is generally fine, but somewhat problematic when you come back after dark and have to look for a switch underneath a lampshade in the corner of the room. Thirdly, the sliding door to the bathroom was rather poorly designed, without ever fully closing, and didnâ€™t offer much in the way of privacy. Lastly, and more generally, a lot of features one would expect in a hotel of this class were only offered on a limited or on-request basis â€“ and this appeared to be mainly justified on the basis of the hotelâ€™s eco-friendly policy (slippers, daily bedding change, certain toiletries, etc â€“ all only upon request). Overall, this did irritate us just a little bit, as while we find it appropriate that one would have to ask for things that most guests may not need (like specific pillows or baby items, etc), it seemed excessive to have to ask for things that most guests would certainly find useful and could just as easily leave untouched if they did not need them (like slippers).To further add to our list of issues, we were mildly disappointed to discover that the a-la-carte breakfast menu that is so prominently displayed on the hotel website is not what is offered when you have â€œbreakfast includedâ€ù in your room rate. In truth, the room rate breakfast offers you access to a fairly good, albeit rather limited, breakfast buffet. Now, not to say that the food was in any way poor, as it was fresh and inspired, but the selection was relatively limited and we felt a little misled in having paid for breakfast in the room rate but not having access to any of the items on the menu. The room rate breakfast also causes some confusion with both serving and billing. First, the servers will always give you the a-la carte menu when they seat you, but it wasnâ€™t until we asked (and we really should not have had to ask) that we found out that we had already paid for something else and the menus were effectively meaningless (unless we wanted to pay for a different second breakfast). Second, even with the buffet, youâ€™re still required to sign your name to a bill as if you were buying the buffet option as a walk-in guest (when in fact this cost has already been paid and will not appear a second time upon checkout). It just seems like this process could really be simplified and improved upon, and some very unnecessary confusion can be avoided through better communication. In addition to this, the breakfast on our first day was truly a comedy of errors (and we say this in good humor, as we just took it in stride and largely laughed it off): we were given water when we asked for orange juice, the potatoes were undercooked, the tea failed to brew properly, and our table was cleared and given to another couple in the brief moment we got up to go grab dessert! (we literally came back to find someone else sitting in our seats) To be fair, things went notably more smoothly throughout the remainder of the trip.As noted earlier, although this list of issues may seem lengthy, they are not major in any sense, and our experience was still generally positive. By any measure, despite everything, we still feel that this is a very good hotel â€“ very centrally located near Union Square, complimented by polite and helpful staff, and nicely decorated in a clean modern style. A few small policy tweaks by management aimed at eliminating the issues and inconveniences we noted above and this hotel would really leave you with very little to complain about.",7-Feb-13,4
"The room is clean and comfortable, the location is great, near the Union Square, the Hotell is very beautifull and that's all! The breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children costs U$ 100.00, but the main reason that made me rate as 2 stars was the Internet. They offer a free wifi Internet access that is terrible! They must know it, as when you proceed the login it's offered an upgrade for a faster access paying U$ 14.00 per day. The fact is that doing this the quality of the access changed from terrible to poor, whith the acceptable connection being archived only near the room's door (!!!!), whith all of the different devices (notebook, iPad and iPhone).They also charged U$ 5.00 to bring to the room a box that arrived on my behalf. The problem is not the amount as its only 5 dolars, but the fact of having brought and then charged without previous information.The Bathroom: There was only 3 towels and we was a party of 4 and the shower had a very weak flow.Me and my family was in SF as tourists in the ending of a 16 days trip trough California and this hotel was the only one that probably will not see me and my family again.",7-Feb-13,3
The Grand Hyatt is just off Union Square giving it a perfect central location for exploring San Francisco. The rooms are updated and the beds are very comfortable. The amenties in the bathrooms are upscale. The service was great. We had very noisy people in the next room and called the front desk. They immediately sent security up to handle the situation and it was resolved within 10 minutes! Then we got a follow up call from the hotel manager. Very impressed!,7-Feb-13,5
"We expended our summer vacation in the beautiful city of San Francisco, and based on the reviews we decided to book Grand Hyatt. This hotel is excellent, great location in the heart of San Francisco, right in Union Square, new furniture and decoration, very clean, friendly and helpful staff; although there was a construction in the lobby, we did not noticed it. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and fully recommend this hotel.",5-Feb-13,5
"I stayed here for 5 nights in December while attending a conference. The hotel itself is in a great location, right next to Union Square, in the heart of the shopping district and a 10 min or so walk to the Convention Centre. I read that the hotel had recently been renovated so I was exciting about arriving but unfortunately it was not as â€˜grandâ€™ as I had imagined with a relatively dim lit reception area with 4 or so laptops. I had to wait 10 mins to check in as there was a queue of people, not really queuing (as there is little space), more milling around. My room on the 6th floor was comfortable but had a horrible view. I was ok with that as I wasnâ€™t there for most of the time. One of the most annoying things was the heavy rain and wind on the first night which made a really loud creaking noise in the room every time the wind blew. I was up most of the night, despite the 11 hr flight from London, and ended up going down to reception at 5am to speak to someone about it. I explained I was 5 months pregnant, travelling alone, and how I needed some sleep with work the next day, but all she did was say that lots of other people had complained, offered me ear plugs and said she was expecting too. I knew there was not much she could do but she didnâ€™t have to be rude about it. I didnâ€™t find the staff half as friendly as other hotels I've stayed in. When I was checking out, the guy at reception even said â€œare you still here?â€ù I felt the same way. I couldnâ€™t wait to get out of there. Iâ€™ve stayed at many Hyatts in the past as Iâ€™m a Gold Ppt holder. Despite our conference being in SF every year, Iâ€™m sad to say I wonâ€™t be staying here again.",3-Feb-13,2
"The Grand Hyatt has been renovated recently and our room was very nice - and,of course, the location is the best! But what was even more impressive was how excellent the staff was - professional yet friendly - totally ""at your service"" and always with a smile. We were so pleased to be given a room on the 29th floor with a stunning city view - it made for a great stay. An extra touch was a welcoming email from one of the managers with the assurance that everything would be done to make our stay ""exceptionally satisfactory"" - which it truly was!",3-Feb-13,5
"We have been to this hotel before and it has certainly gone down hill. On the face of it the hotel has been remodelled, but it has been a negative not a positive. The beds and pillows are really not good and the reception service not great. We had a drink in the bar, which is nice, but I have never so many people behind a bar doing nothing. When I went to the bar it was too much for one to just serve I was told its table service so you then wait 10mins for that while you watch 6 guys behind the bar do sod all! Good way to get tips up, but USA is driven that way. Overall wont stay here again and more a business (on expenses) experience. Overall not good, but a great location. The stay was finally finished off when the town car we took got pulled over by the cops on the way to the airport.... Possibly the worst driving I have every seen!",3-Feb-13,2
"Spent a weekend here on vacation. It's at a great location near Union Square, Market Street, Chinatown and Nob HIll. Positives - 1. Lovely large room 2. Recently remodelled, so everything is pretty much brand new. 3. Bathroom supplies are nice and unconventional - ginger body lotion and cucumber soap. 4. Room had a large closet and a dressing table and chair. 5. Breakfast buffet and ala carte menu is pretty good. Had the eggs benedict - nice. Restaurant staff are attentive, perhaps a tad too attentive. 6. Hotel can arrange a shared shuttle to the airport for US$16.Negatives - 1. No master control switch for lights next to bed. 2. Switches for bedside lamps are hard to find. 3. Free Wifi is slow and hard to connect to. 4. Think only 1-2 lifts out of 6 lead to the Mezzanine level where breakfast is served. A little confusing. 5. Would have been nice if reception had asked if I needed information about the city. Got that a day later from the Concierge.",3-Feb-13,4
"I stayed in an executive suite for 2 nights. It had 2 full bathrooms, one with a tub for our girls and another with a shower only. It was nice to get ready for my meeting without disturbing my family. The location can not be beat. The renovation was excellent. The Grand Lounge had an amazing views. The staff in the lounge was wonderful, he saw that I needed and extra chair and brought it over before I had a chance to ask. Would definitely stay here again.",2-Feb-13,5
"Stayed at this hotel three nights. this was my first stay after the renovation and I see there is a significant improvement. room is efficient. strange looking sink. everything except bathtub in the room seemed renovated. friendly staff. great location. as we all know we should not expect much from big American chain hotels (Hyatt, Hilton, Sheraton, Marriott, etc.) in the us unlike the ones in Asia, this hotel was one of the better one in the US.",1-Feb-13,4
"After our 14+ hour flight from Australia and a shower, it was fabulous to crawl in to the exceptionally comfortable bed...!! Very impersonal registration process, you look for reception desk to find there are some benches with laptops and when you step up to one a receptionist walks over, books you in and hands you your keys - at AU$227 a night I was expecting a little more. The room was great and you could not have asked for more in regards to position though. Disappointed with the buffet at their OneUP Restaurant - see my review. FORGOT TO MENTION: Could not believe to see people stepping out of elevators with dogs on leashes as we were waiting. DOGS staying in hotel rooms??? YES!!",28-Jan-13,4
"This hotel is in the best of locations in Union Square. The recent facelift is beautiful however the loud pounding music( noise) competing with the enthusiastic chatter throughout the reception/ mezzanine area in the early to late evenings is very negative. One can't hear to converse in the lobby sitting area whether it be with a companion or staff member. What a shame. It seems that this hotel is trying to compete with W hotels in a non favorable manner. Oh by the way the loud pounding music is piped in when you get off the elevator, yet another reminder. One saving grace is that once you get to your room you've arrived to a quiet haven and the rooms are nicely remodeled.",28-Jan-13,3
"I really did not see anything wrong with this Hotel for a four star rating. The rooms were just remodeled. the bar and restaurant had just opened (brand new). THE ONLY CRITICISM i had was its a weird front desk. I personally like a grand entrance with a big impressive front desk, art work and attentive hotel staff behind it. This hotel just a table with a a staff person at it with a computer.There were about 6 or 8 tables in the lobby and that was it, maybe its the new thing.I would look on all the discount site for your stay here because you can get it for under $200 a night.Also if your driving opt for the Self Park option only $36. per night with in and out privileges and its about 1/4 block away. The regular hotel parking is $56.You are in the heart of San Fran so don.t eat in the hotel. There are plenty and I mean plenty of restaurants with in walking distance.",28-Jan-13,4
"Came on a business trip for a convention in the hotel. Location was excellent and the guestrooms well appointed clean and updated with many plugs and outlet beautiful bathrooms.My room as quiet on the 22nd floor and had a great view.The service at the hotel was less than ordinary. Being in the hospitality business, I travel extensively and had high expectations for the Grand Hyatt. Check in and check out was less than satisfactory and waiter service at the restaurant was lacking in service. Had eggs for breakfast and no toast was even offered, It was not a great experience and I do not suggest eating in the hotel, it was less than perfect and expensive.",26-Jan-13,4
"After a week on business it was nice to have a night in this great hotel right in the heart of they city. Love the location! Close to all the great shopping. The hotel was lovely. The valet greeted us and informed us of an assisted self service parking option across the street which also allows in and out access - much cheaper than most downtown options.Check in was easy with their open check in space. Room was clean, beautiful, and comfortable. Was a wonderful stay. And Internet was free to boot!",25-Jan-13,4
"I'm a business traveler who unfortunately spends far too much time in hotels. My review foucses on the Grand Hyatt San Francisco reservations staff. While attempting to make my booking, the staffer seemed very annoyed with the questions I had, regarding the rates for the Regency club room and specific room locations. I also inquired about Rack /Amex / AAA rates. It was strange, since I've never had a bad experience with their folks before. I have stayed at other Grand Hyatt properties with little issue, surprised and a little dissapointed. -Ed",24-Jan-13,2
"My wife and I stayed at this Grand Hyatt for New Year's Eve and found the reciently completed remodel excellent. The hotel was packed beccause of the holiday but the new ""tripod"" check in desks made for quick, easy, and fast service. The room remodels also are very guest friendly as well as beautiful with thoughtful additions such as electrical connectors in the side of the night table and communications panel in the side of the television cabinet in living room. I am not sure of the cause, but the new elevator system had a glitch while we were there leaving only two of the cars running. This caused a back up and delay getting up and down from your room. The staff were very gracious in handleing the unhappy patrons and repairs were immediately started. Good customer service is easy under normal circumstances. It's when a problem arises that true colors are shown and I have to say the staff rose to the occation. Good job!",24-Jan-13,5
"This hotel is perfect in it's design, which is contemporary, sleek & modern. It's location is also perfect, within walking distance to many of the sights, i.e. Chinatown, shopping. The service is excellent, from check-in to doorman to conceriege to waiters. We had a bay view room, & it was perfect & a beautiful sight to wake up to each morning. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!",24-Jan-13,5
"I was searching for something reasonable to attend a wedding around Union Square and found a $159 deal on an executive suite at the Grand Hyatt.Considering the room was in fact a 1 bedroom 2 bath suite it was fantastic. I understand the property was recently remodeled and now the rooms have every high tech feature and toy you can dream of from power window shades on. In fact it was almost confusing to control the room at times.So if you are considering JW or any of the other 5 stars in downtown, then check here too. And for that matter if you can get a deal like I did, then consider it the best deal in town, look no farther.Happy Traveling,Uncle Eric",23-Jan-13,5
"It's just next to the Union Square. Walking distance to Chinatown, restaurants and shopping malls. Great customer service. They offered gifts to the kids at their front desk. Self parking is just across the street for about $32 plus tax per night. Definitely recommended.",23-Jan-13,5
"Where does one start, great Hotel, great service, great bar, shopping.... Hello! This is in shopping central allowing for furtive sessions in Macy's and time to drop back in the room before visiting the Levi store (30 seconds away), Porsche Design shop etc etc.... Forgot to mention I was on business and one of the best Steak Houses.... Mortons. Food to die for, they serve just steak and you choose the sides!",23-Jan-13,5
"I love staying here. I enjoy seeing so many regulars on the staff. Place has minimal turnover. The move to downsize the check in area - make it more personal, built around lap tops also works for me. And always, the bowl of peppermint taffy. Was great to be back.",23-Jan-13,5
"I am a gold passport member with HYATT and it comes with lots of goodies and surprises.so my reason for staying in Hyatt properties is obvious.Although it is always good to advice on your priorities beforehand so that you don't get dissapointed last minute.Hotel is very well located in the heart of downtown union square , restaurants, theater, nightclub, lounges and cable car to wharf on adjacent corner.It is also a treat to the shopoholics because the hotel is surrounded with all the fancy brands.Good breakfast and comfortable rooms.I understand that they are recently renovated lobby.I particularly like the bay view room .OneUP restaurant has amazing wine collection and yummy californian menu.It is also a great venue for conference.",22-Jan-13,5
"we stayed at hyatt fishermans wharf(see review on that) then we transferred to this hyatt for our shopping day, since all the stores are practically right outside the door. Everything from the entry to the lobby was just amazing and beautiful we were told it just went through a huge renovation. After your done with the touristy things and you just want to shop and walk through the shopping mall this would be the ideal hotel to stay at. we were on the 31st floor and we had a nice view. The staff was incredible we had a very nice front desk csr name Jazelle who took care of checking us in and going through all the fine details very nice young lady. Everyone from the porter to front desk houskeeping regency club attendants everyone associated with that hotel seem to be really enjoying their jobs. The hotel was clean rooms comfortable and location unbeatable. Would highly recommend this property.",21-Jan-13,5
"Staff was great, renovated rooms smaller but very nice. The main we have returned on many occasions was the amazing top floor restaurant and lounge, which had breathtaking views in a comfortable and relaxing setting. Since renovation, the restaurant is now on the mezzanine and the views are reserved for conference rooms. There are many great hotels in this area, and loss of the top floor to guests have hurt.",20-Jan-13,3
"I loved this hotel, it is pratically new, the service is good, we had good concierge who gave us some really good advice on where to go in the city, rooms are very nice, but the highlight is the amazing breakfast view from the rooftop!Great option for business, couples, families or solo!",19-Jan-13,5
"3rd time for me at the Grand Hyatt, now totally renovated, the lobby is beautiful, fireplaces, cozy sofas and all the staff is really professional. I had a room on the 21st floor with a stunning view on Union Sq. Rooms are nice and simple, super-clean and very quiet; this is a really good hotel in a strategic position. I will come back for sure at Grand Hyatt in San Francisco, my best choice in town... and I am a very picky traveler!",19-Jan-13,5
"I've stayed here many times over the past 20 yrs. It's a great location for shopping and dining right near union square and the cablecar line. It's been redone recently - modern, functional, but not the best quality. The beds, bathroom, and size of rooms are very good. Great food for breakfast. The conceirge staff is great - do ask them for help and reccomendations. Get a room on a high floor overlooking the square and the hills of San Fran.",18-Jan-13,4
"This is a really nice choice if you are interested in being downtown by the Ferry Building. Many of the rooms have views of bay and most of them have balconies, which I think is a really great given the room ventilation issues with most hotels of this size. We stayed on one of the club levels --- I'd recommend doing this since there a great view from the lounge on the top floor and the food there is quite good. Service is great and the rooms are well designed. This is a hotel that won't blow your socks away but will likely do a terrific job at serving as a comfortable, convenient base as you explore San Francisco.",17-Jan-13,4
"We stayed here for 7 nights whilst attending a conference. The room was modern, spacious and well-equipped and the hotel is in the perfect location for visiting Union Square and the conference centre. The new bar and restaurant which opened on the last night of our stay was very nice but expensive. Unfortunately, we had not been informed when booking via the conference website of the building work that would be undertaken during our stay which meant that the new reception area and bar/restaurant were not available for 6 out of the 7 nights. There was a shabby-looking cash only bar on the top floor which was only open from the early evening and not open at all on some evenings and a wildly-overpriced buffet service restaurant with limited opening hours available for food which resulted in us having to go out elsewhere for all of our meals and drinks. When pointing out that we were disappointed about the lack of facilities available during our stay the gentleman on reception merely replied 'yes, the bar is closed' without looking up from his computer and did not apologise or suggest an alternative facility in the area. Not the service we would expect from this standard of accomodation.",17-Jan-13,3
"I've stayed at many Hyatts, and this is one of the best. It's a classic beauty and the service level is top notch. Their Regency Club is the best I've been in. I strongly urge you to book a Club package if you are not a Diamond Member. (In which case it is complimentary.) David made the Regency Club experience unforgettable. He is simply a kind and gracious addition to the experience. Bedding is super comfortable, and I ended up spending more time in bed than I had planned. The location cannot be beat, as we were able to walk to Chinatown, Nob Hill and even Fisherman's Wharf from here. I consider this Hyatt a destination, and I will be making another trip here in the near future.",15-Jan-13,5
I had never stayed at this hotel and I was pleased with the location and service. The have been renovated to a very high standard from both business and casual traveler. The views are tremendous. My only complaint is the restaurant is more then a little over the top for breakfast. Other then that this a great location in SF.,12-Jan-13,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights whilst in San Francisco for a conference.Despite having 'man flu' the whole time I was in San Francisco I still very much enjoyed my stay and found the hotel very comfortable, quite and relaxing.The view from my room was superb and the view from the restaurant is even better. The location right in the centre is also excellent.The service and care from the staff was great too. In short I would love to return for a personal holiday with my wife some day.",10-Jan-13,5
"First of all I feel guilty for not writing this review many months ago! I hosted a grand luncheon for a special birthday for 30 ladies in feb. 2012. From the planning stage till it was finished everything went smoothly. I work with a lady named Kaleen Bartlet and she was most gracious, accommodating and very professional.It was at their event room on the top floor! Breathtaking views! Everything was done according to my specification. Had 4 course sit down meal which was executed perfectly. The waiting staff, the bar tender and the supervisor were all very courteous and professional.Only thing I Had a problem with was their ""corkage"" fee and policy. I guess I should have paid more attention. Make sure you choose your minimum for the event and whether it is cheaper to get their wines instead of bringing your own. ",9-Jan-13,5
"We stayed at this hotel over Christmas. The weather was gloomy, but the location could not have been better.From check in to check out the experience was wonderful. It is a whole unique experience. The check in desks look more like casual computer stations. It is a new concept and confusing when you are looking for the standard check in desk. Hyatt thought of that aspect too. There are several Hyatt employees in the lobby to immediately assist you.Our room was ready even though we checked in early and we were quickly escorted up to the room. We stayed on the 19th floor, and upon entering the room we had this amazing view of the city surrounding Coit Tower. It was such an impressive entrance to a room. The room was done in a sleek modern style that was also extremely inviting. We could have comfortably relaxed in this room with the amazing view, but Union Square with all of the holiday finery was just around the corner. We could easily walk to Chinatown also.As far as the bar and restaurant facilities, I think the hotel was lacking in this area. The service in the bar was impeccable, but it was a very strange design with odd furniture. At peak bar times, seating was at a premium. The restaurant left one cold. We ate there Christmas eve. There were 5 selections and left us hungry when we left. To compound this on Christmas we had lunch there since we were departing that afternoon, and it was the same menu. I am sure the cooks put together this special menu, but a simple hamburger would have been a nice choice also.There are several unique items that they have decorated the hotel with. We enjoyed our stay but as far as things to do in the hotel on cold wet rainy San Francisco days, or to get away from the crowds, this hotel is very limited. It was such a perfect location.While we were there the ASU football team was there to play Notre Dame, so our visit has lots of screaming kids in the lobby, not to mention leaving big messes (open food containers, apple cores, potatoe chip bags etc.)that the staff quickly cleaned. The staff was beyond exellent and so was the location. Go confidently that it is a marvelous hotel.",9-Jan-13,5
"Very good location very pleasant staff, before I arrive I got an email that protest at the front gate, but the staff they did there best to help my to reach the front disc, really every thing was great. The hotel was a bit noisy even my room at the 12th floor.",8-Jan-13,4
"The Grand Hyatt is our favorite San Francisco hotel, and we've enjoyed it for several years. We love the spirit of the Union Square, and appreciate it even more when the Ice Skating is on. Hotel service, comfort, friendliness, etc. is always perfect.It was beyond disappointing to learn that the 'Grand Views' bar on the upper floor is no longer serving hotel guests.... The 'Grand Views' truly belongs to the San Francisco 'must see' list. Hate to find this enormous downgrade to otherwise joyful stay.I consider the recent renovation a success: modern hotel style is very appropriate for San Francisco. I expect some modern, but nonsense bar furniture is replaced by now, or will be replaced soon. We were so sorry for the waiters missing extra-narrow bar tables!",7-Jan-13,4
"With construction complete the Grand Hyatt San Francisco is my new place to lay my head when my wife and I go to SFO. There was a sophistication that came with the hotel. The halls were not filled with yelling children, nor were the elevators lined with drunken adults. Over the Thanksgiving holiday we assumed there would be families and tourists galore. We made the getaway from our family tables looking for a good time, so naturally we assumed others would do the same. They did come out in droves, but all were well behaved. The hotel is right next to Union Square. If you have ever been to San Fran, you are well aware of how crowded Union Square can get. Being that it was Black Friday and the Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony the street surrounding the hotel were closed. After the initial day after Thanksgiving shock, the street opened and getting in and out of the hotel was much more tolerable. Market St, the main street is just a few blocks away. From there we were able to get to every part of the city with the clipper card. Chinatown was a short quick walk about 2 blocks away. The Warf is a nice 20 minute walk through North Beach and Chinatown. The remodel was fantastic. We had a large room on the corner, which allowed for the bathroom to be in a different position. It was at the back of the room, down a short hallway. With bathrooms normally off the entrance to the room it was nice to have it isolated. It kept the light out of my eyes while my wife got ready in the morning. The beds were comfortable, the TV was large, and the aesthetics were pleasing. My favorite was the automatic curtains. I was like a child playing with a new toy every time I opened and closed the curtains from the warmth of my bed. We happened to get a special for $150 a night including breakfast and WIFI. The WIFI signal was sufficient. I wasnâ€™t streaming movies so it didnâ€™t matter the speed anyhow. The breakfast was ok. It was trying a little too hard. I am a basics type of guy. The sour cream and shallot scrambled eggs were a little much. This is San Fran! If you are going to put stuff out for the guests to eat you better keep on par with the other 150 restaurants serving amazing breakfast. We tried it one day and didnâ€™t go beck the next 2. We were happier going and paying for something we truly enjoyed. Besides the food, the hotel was great. A convenient location, great design and formidable service make the higher price worth it.",7-Jan-13,4
"A great hotel to access downtown San Francisco. Right next to Union Square and great shops and restaurants. A short walk to Chinatown , so you can enjoy the city. It is a short cab ride to San Francisco wharf 29. Great views of downtown San Francisco start at about floor 24. The only drawback is that when the hotel is filled it takes forever (10-15 minutes) to ride the elevator .",6-Jan-13,5
"It's been approximately 10 years since I have stayed at this hotel. I chose it for its location. I remember it as sort of outdated. Wow, I was so pleasantly surprised by its recent renovation. I loved the warm wood tone colors throughout. I was especially pleased by the new open check in process. The staff was overly friendly.The rooms were beautiful. We stayed in room 2815 and had a beautiful view of the bay on both sides and of the city. Other family members stayed in room 810 and had a great view of Union Square, the Christmas tree, ice rink and Macy's beautifully decorated windows. The beds were so comfortable. I also loved the lounge where there were comfortable couches and even live entertainment to enjoy. The atmosphere was both relaxing and fun. I will definitely stay here again.",6-Jan-13,5
"Great view, comfortable bed, fridge, quiet room, in a well run, well located hotel.$280 per night was good value for SF.Try the bar after dinner for good live music in an attractive setting. One block from Union Square. ",5-Jan-13,5
"Grand Hyatt SF is in a great location, has a great front desk team - and a open front desk plan, so it itself is an experience. The hotel just finished a renovation and it is well done! Very modern hotel, but warm and inviting. Hyatt always uses great products, the amenities in the room were outstanding. We had a room on the 30th floor and the room featured hardwood flooring! This is only on their top floors and suites as far as I know - great addition! No shortcuts were taken in the renovation which was nice - everything seemed brand new. These are city rooms so keep in mind they run smaller in size, but this room was of good size. Great views and easy to get to. Valet parking can be a little tricky if there is a lot of traffic but they stayed on top of keeping everything moving.The Grand Club was amazing! They did a stellar job in design and it flows well - the staff in the lounge is outstanding and kind. The drinks in the club lounge were exceptionally well priced - I was amazed - If I remember beers are $3 and mixed are $4! Anyone that uses club lounges knows that is a pretty fair price! Esp. for a downtown property!The only gripe was that it seemed they had one elevator working - we had to wait a while for the elevator every time - the hotel was busy with NYE, but it was a hassle.Stay here if you enjoy the Hyatt brand or want a prime location in SF. It is right next to Union Square without being in a shady area.",4-Jan-13,5
"Settled just with union square, it's just a few steps away from shops like Levi's and others. Moreover it's no more than a 10 minute walk to Chinatown, hence making it's strategic location a plus point. The lobby was ""slickly"" furnished and the people at the front desk were very accomodating and friendly. The room was beautifully furnished , spacious , clean and had all the items you could ask for. The flat-screen tv showed a wide variety of programmes in HD and the bed was soft and very comfortable. We stayed on the 26th floor and the view of union square that we had was magnificent at night. The only problem we encountered was that the concierge made several mistakes. Firstly when we asked for a morning call on one of the days, it wasn't registered and hence we didn't get it. Secondly, when we signed up for the airport shuttle stating that we wanted the bus to reach at 8.30am, the shuttle didn't come and stated that the hotel put our names down for the 9am slot instead of the 8.30 one. However the frontdesk was kind enough to take a certain amount off our entire bill as compensation.Overall, my family and i did enjoy our experience there and would definitely visit there again !",3-Jan-13,5
"My husband and I had a great time in this hotel. We celebrated our second honeymoon in San Francisco. We stayed at a room with a breathtaking view of San Francisco. The breakfast was good enough for us, nothing to complain. The hotel is very well located, many interesting places within a walking distance.",3-Jan-13,5
"The hotel is very modern and ""Slick"". The rooms are nice and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. However, did not like the restaurant or bar. They used to have a restaurant and bar on top of the hotel that had a wonderful view. But they changed it all and put it on the mezzanine level. Why? Second of all they stole my IPAD!!!! Don't trust the housekeeping staff.",31-Dec-12,2
"Newly renovated hotel provides very comfortable rooms. Views from the 19th floor and above are spectacular. Location on Union Square means you can walk to shopping and dining. BART, Muni, Cable cars and buses are all a short walk. This can all be had at other properties. What sets this hotel apart are the people. We're checking in at 5:30 pm on a Wednesday. The young man at the desk tells me the suite is not ready, he'll take care of the bags and sends us to the lounge for a glass of whatever. I'm in business. I know things go wrong. The lounge service is very good and the tomato soup is outstanding. The young man comes up to collect us and show us to the room. The bags arrive all is in harmony. The young man calls a little later to inquire about our room, everything is fine. He then tells me he's going to send up a bottle of wine and an appetizer. I tell him it's not necessary, he insist. Next day I call the concierge to inquire about some mail that should have been there. He tells me it's not in the system but he'll go down to the mail room later. We come back from shopping there's the mail on the table. I went down to get his card and show my gratitude. I have nothing but positive feedback about house keeping, room service, the bellmen,and the staff at the Grand Club. I'm a diamond member and the PEOPLE at Hyatt consistently remind me why I like their brand. And why I wouldn't stay anywhere else in San Francisco. I noticed a member of Hyatt reads these reviews. Why did you close Grandviews?",30-Dec-12,5
"We have stayed at Grabd Hyatt every Christmas Holiday for the last 6 years. It has always been consistent and a pleasant experience. The hotel has just finished a major interior renovation - it's nice, Eco friendly, and a bit minimalistic in style. However my two complaints are the front desk check in area as well as the front desk service. The check in area is now a few table like desks instead of the traditional reception counter. It was very confusing to figure out who was waiting in line and when the next reception agent was available. Having stayed here several times over the years this was the first occasion that the reception and check in was far less than acceptable. Our reception agent was not friendly nor was he interested in assisting us in getting a decent room location. We are situated in a corner next to the housekeeping closet. Each time we have exited our room and returned the closet is open and there are housekeeping carts blocking our way in to our rooms. Even after going back downstairs and inquiring again about being relocated even at a higher price we were told there was nothing he could do. Not being able to relocate us is a bit unbelievable but what was worse was the reception agent's complete lack of concern for our satisfaction. Very disappointing and we may check out tomorrow and go elsewhere. The Marriott up the street was very nice when we cruised by and sadly after many years of memories here we will most likely make this our last stay.",30-Dec-12,3

"Stayed two nights before x'mas. Right next to the Union Square and in the core of the downtown area. Very convenient, don't need a car. Hotel was new renovated, looks good. But had a weird smell in our floor and the room. Elevator is very slow. Have 6 elevators but still have to wait more than 5min on average. Once we were going up and some guests got in the elevator and said they've been waiting for 10mins. They were actually going down but couldn't wait any longer.The first night we received 3 phone calls around 1:30AM. My husband picked up the third one the staff said he was confused and asked us to confirmed how many people were staying. We went to the front desk the second day and was told that another guest with the same name check-in the hotel at 1AM. The staff just wanted to make sure that they were not with us. But still, there was no other way but calling the guest during the midnight???We went to their lounge located at the MZ level for drinks twice. We had the same server for both nights. No greetings, no smiles, no nothing from her. The second night we wondered if they have sweet potato fries, she simply said ""No"" and left. When we asked for the bill she literally slipped the bill on our table without one word and walked away.",30-Dec-12,3
"Lobby is nearly finished and looks great fire pits outside,fireplaces inside very nice when you come in from the cold weather breakfast buffet was great. Room was great ,nice beds fast elevators excellant hotel!! ",30-Dec-12,5
The hotel is located right on Union Square so is right next to the main shopping area. The rooms looked recently renovated. While not the largest rooms I have stayed in they are nonetheless clean and modern. The beds were comfortable and the A/C was easy to use and quiet and the room included all the basic amenities. Having stayed at previous Hyatts everything was as expected from a leading hotel chain. The staff were always very helpful and very accommodating to our requests during out entire stay and the bellhop was especially helpful whenever we needed help with directions.,30-Dec-12,5
"I stayed here for business in late Nov. Because they were full, I was upgraded to a suite on a higher floor, so my experience was definitely more positive! However, one of my business associates had a regular room and said it was fine as well. The views from the upper floors of the hotel if are great - over look Uniion Square and then SF bay in the background. Staff is extremely helpful and nice. And location is great if you are going to market street or Union Sq shopping. Not as convenient to the wharf area but close to a BART stop.Overall, a very good experience!",29-Dec-12,5
"This hotel is located on Union Square in San Francisco and is convinient for shopping trips or attending the theater. We live in the Bay Area and have stayed here before for those evenings where you want to stay in the city for dinner or a show and not need to worry about driving home.In the past this hotel had a ""corporate"" feel to it and the rooms were a little plain. A major renovation occured since we last stayed and it has a completely different personality. It starts with the pods (small tables) which the staff use to check you in via laptop and the living room feel of the lobby. The bar/restaurant has a much more hip feel to it. Our room was also nicely furnished and comfortable. Congrat's to Hyatt for a nice update to a well situated hotel.",28-Dec-12,5
"Stayed only 1 night. 5 minute walk from the Bart, in the middle of union square shopping. Beautiful, modern hotel. Check in very fast and efficient and friendly. Recognized our platinum status and told me I would get free upgraded wifi and offered me a late check out. Most Hyatt's I have to ask for those perks and I find it annoying. Nice to have been offered them right away. Room was small but very modern. Gym is on 35th floor with an amazing view. Would stay here again in a heart beat. Staff was all very friendly.",26-Dec-12,5
"We enjoyed this Hyatt. We were in town for a wedding, the room was nice, bar on top floor was great. Staff very responsive. Great value. They did have construction during our visit, but we were aware of it, as it was on the Hyatt website. Enjoyed the stay in the city by the bay, would return.",26-Dec-12,5
"My husband and I visited San Francisco for the first time for a vacation. This hotel had just been renovated, and our room was absolutely beautiful. It was so clean and modern, and they thought of everything in its design. Next to the bed was a wall reading lamp on each side and controls for the huge window shade. There were outlets everywhere. We stay in Manhattan a couple of times a year and they never have enough outlets in the hotels for gadget chargers; we have to bring an extension cord with us! Our room, which was an upgraded King, had a dressing area (vanity and closet), and then a sleek modern bathroom. We had a huge window taking up the whole wall overlooking the city. I don't know if it was because I signed up for the Hyatt Gold Passport (which was free), but we were given complementary wine in our room. It may have been because we were frazzled from a long ride from Yosemite and still had to bring the rental car back to the airport at 7 or 8 p.m.! In any event, the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. We had gotten a package deal which included breakfast each morning, and it was fantastic. The views from our room and the restaurant were breathtaking. The room was extremely quiet even though we were in the heart of the city.Without the package deal, I probably would not have been able to afford this hotel and the upgraded room. I can't understand why parking and/or wireless is not included in the room price for all the money they ask. I decided to do without the wifi, since my smart phone gets 4G.My husband and I are planning a trip to San Diego in September 2013 and would really like to stay in a Hyatt again if I can get another package deal like this one.",26-Dec-12,5
"After having done a lot of research of hotels to stay in San Francisco, we chose the Grand Hyatt.... Not disappointed with this Hotel. The refurb certainly has worked. We had our room on the 29th floor and the views were breathtaking..... The service was fantastic. Quite surprising that this place has just one restaurant. The coffee area opposite the concierge was fantastic and a special thanks to Suzzane who took care of my daughter with nice warm chocolate! Will be back...",24-Dec-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt lobby and mezzanine-level restaurant appear to have been nicely and recently renovated. The rooms are well-furnished, as you would expect for a Grand Hyatt with adequate wi-fi and the latest electronic equipment. Beds are comfortable. You may want to ask for a non-adjoining room, as you can hear everything from the hallway and the next-door room. Another alternative is to ask for a hypo-allergenic room, which comes with an air purifier. It fortunately puts out white noise to help with the other noise you will probably hear....",22-Dec-12,4
"I would have given this hotel 5 stars except that I had to wait for breakfast on both days because the restaurant is pretty tiny. I stayed on a thurs and fri night, and I had a bit of jet lag coming over from Asia so breakfasts are always my hungriest meals - unfortunately I had to wait about 10 mins before i could be seated and I didn't think the buffet selection was that great. THere were only about 4-5 hot food selections which was disappointing ,and it was the same on both days, no variety. Rooms were excellent, I was on the 7th floor, not very tall, but good size. I was paying sub US$200 a night, very good value in my view. If you come out of the hotel, turn right and right and go a block, you are in union square. I love shopping in SF and shopping around union sq, absolutely fantastic location.I use to stay at the Four Seasons SF and Ive stayed at the Westin St Francis and I've stayed at the Huntington hotel (small luxury) and i have to say id def choose the Grand Hyatt over the other hotels. i think location, plus comfort of room are the two biggest positives.One complaint I have is if you order from places like amazon and ship to the hotel, they charge $5 bucks per item and you know how Amazon can be, sometimes packaging one item per box - the charges add up.",21-Dec-12,4
This hotel has it all. The beds are just gorgeous! Sooo comfortable! The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms have amazing views and the hotel has everything you could possibly need. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks to the Grand Hyatt for making our first time in San Fran amazing!!!,20-Dec-12,5
"i stayed in this hotel for 4 nights mid dec 2012. the location is perfect right in the middle of shopping district and close to all kinds of public transportation. walking distace to china town and market street. check in and check out was so easy and fron dest staff are really nice and professional. The rooms were nice but beware that no matter how high your room is, you still can hear all the traffic ( i was on 27th floor and i still could hear it ) . The breakfast was not impressive however there are many nice restaurants in the area that you won't get bored. The people at consiege are really helpful and nice. you can count on them for good advice. There were some issues which can not be called problem but might need some attention : There was no bottled water in the room, which now adays is offered im mostly all good hotels. There 2 times that i called house keeping for items like robe and slippers and it took me three phone calls to have them brought to me. As i mentioned the noise from street can be a set back. No pools or spa. However i was told there were several nice spas in the area. I couldn't go because they were booked for times i wished to go. But in general a nice stay :-)",17-Dec-12,4
"I just returned from a week in San Francisco on business where I stayed at the Grand Hyatt. I have nothing but compliments and great things to say about this amazing hotel and truly caring staff. When I arrived, check-in was prompt and even though I arrived well before check in time, my room was ready and the process didn't take more than 5 minutes. Upon arrival, I was informed that I had been selected as ""guest of the day"" which brought with it an upgraded room and several other wonderful surprises. I want to let people know about my experience in several areas:Location - There is not a finer location in San Francisco than that of the Grand Hyatt overlooking Union Square. Hotel Appearance - The renovations to the lobby and public areas of the hotel are wonderful. The Hyatt was always a classy property but now they have stepped up even more. Great design, great appearance.Staff - This is where the Grand Hyatt truly distinguishes itself. This is a large hotel with hundreds of rooms but it NEVER felt like a large impersonal ""conference type"" hotel. I was always referred to by name and people just bent over backwards to help and be friendly.Rooms - Again, great job on the renovation. The room was quiet, comfortable, clean, and classy. Loved it. I want to thank everyone at the Hyatt for going the extra mile to make my stay a great and memorable one!",17-Dec-12,5
I was debating if I should stay at Hyatt at Fishermans Wharf or the Grand Hyatt. I wont regret this place is completely refurbished and rooms was real nice and jazzy. The club is really great. The best is the coffee machine and could get my Cappuccion any time. Right next to the shopping district and it is not more than $15 cab ride to the Fishermans wharf. You could also take $6 ride on the cable car right from the next block.I would certainly come back again to this property.,16-Dec-12,5
Even though I made reservations a month in advance and when my wife and i arrived at the grand hyatt we were told that the only room they had was ada compliant. the hotel was totally booked and no other rooms were available. after much discussion the hotel finally reduced the room cost. as for the hotel breakfast in one up lounge was over priced and the buffet food was cold.,16-Dec-12,3
"Stayed here over thanksgiving long weekend for a law conference. Stayed in a recently renovated huge corner room with super comfy king size bed with a mountain of super comfortable pillows and top shelf linens and duvet. 46 inch flat screen tv with large selection of channels and virtually everything accessed via the TV computer system. Bathroom was huge and immaculate, tons of storage space in closet and one or two bureaus/chest o drawers. Mini fridge was great as was the large desk and extra chair and side table. Can't say enough about the location across the street from Union Square and walking distance to many great restaurants, bars, pubs, shopping, Chinatown and even AT&T Park. Outstanding! Only minor complaints are that the in hotel food offerings are a little slim with only one restaurant and one lounge/bar with very limited menu. Had the burger a couple of times and it was fantastic as was the pizza and seafood salad. Room service was very prompt and arrived well presented and very tasty. Room service, while admittedly expensive offered significantly better value than room service I have had at a number of Fairmonts. Other complaints are that you could sometimes hear a fair amount of noise emanating from the hallway as the doors have quite a bit of space between the bottom and the floor. Also, forgot my iPhone on the end of the bed when I was in a hurry to get to the AT&T Park Tour and when I got back a couple hours later it was gone, stolen by housekeeping. Checked back numerous times with front desk same day and over the next few days when I got back home to no avail. Hotel was pretty blasÃ© about it and offered to compensation whatsoever and suggested I make a claim with my home insurance -- not really a satisfactory approach in my view. Also, was a little disappointed that there was no in room mini bar or snacks, which I found to be very odd for a hotel of this caliber. Also a little disappointed that there was no swimming pool. Value was decent however at $179 per night. Were it not for the aforementioned complaints, I would probably have given this hotel a 5 star rating. Generally found the staff and service to be very professional and excellent with the exception of when dealing with the in-room theft of my iPhone, which I thought to be rather cavalier and less than helpful. If you go, make sure you lock your valuables in the room safe or they will likely be gone when you return to your room.",14-Dec-12,4
"I spend 3 nights in the Grand Hyatt for a convention in November and the hotel is great and modern. the room design is clean and modern. The bathroom is functional and shower head is good. The service is great and the restaurant and lobby are good. The entertainment system is good as well as the internet. I was able to take the BART from SFO to Powell for $9 and back to SFO. The hotel is 4 blocks away, 10 minutes walk right on Union Square.",14-Dec-12,4
"Pros1. location - just above Union Square; across the street from Starbucks and the Taj Campton Place; kitty-corner from the Sutter-Stockton garage (much cheaper than hotel valet parking which uses this facility). Great shopping withing blocks.2. room decor - recently remodeled, variety of bed pillows (hard, soft, flat). Flattering lighted mirrors in the bathroom and closet area. 44"" HD television with handy hyperlinked guide to go directly to the program using the remote which has a built-in trackball mouse.3. lobby - like a cozy living room(s) with fire place(s); public bathrooms are very modern.4. service - very friendly and helpful staff; minimalist front ""desk"" right by the front door.5. upgrades - available with online reservations; inexpensive; but once you request it you must take it if available on check-in.Cons1. noise - from adjacent rooms and hallway: bathroom and sneezing noises can be heard; large gap under the lower edge of the front door lets in the hallway noise like room service and closing doors.2. radio - couldn't find it.",12-Dec-12,5
"I stayed with my wife for five days on business. This is one of the best Hyatt hotels we have stayed in. The hotel is on Union Square in the center of the shopping area of the city, it appears to have been completely renovated, everything seemed new and clean. Our room was large with a chair, desk with chair, very comfortable bed with pillow-top mattress, lots of outlets for our electronics, a large well-lighted bath with tub and shower plus a separate make-up desk with mirror and lights. The lobby is large with many chairs to sit and talk with colleagues but a little drafty with wind from the front doors. Our room was relatively quiet. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Check in and out was very fast. My wife used the exercise room and rates it good. I never saw lines at the reception. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel. When in San Francisco I always go to Lorris Diners for breakfast.My only concern was street noise. We were on the 29th floor overlooking Union Square, and we could clearly hear the musicians (for some reason drummers were out in force this year) and people singing. All rooms have sliding doors that can open a few inches, and they do not seal out noise very well. I hope the hotel seals the doors, or replaces them with non-opening, sealed windows. Still, the noise did not bother us, and it is quiet by 11PM or so.",12-Dec-12,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in November 2012 and had a memorable trip. San Francisco is such a charming city and the Hotel stay made it a memorable trip.The union square location is THE biggest plus- it cannot be beat. Just walk one block down and you are in union square, three or four blocks to the Powel st. Cable car, five or six blocks to Market street- you get the idea!!We booked directly from the Hyatt site and got a very good AAA rate. Our stay turned out to be quite eventful because our 9 month old baby was down with a virus. Elaine (sp?) at concierge was so helpfl, though, that we cannot thank her enough. She helped us find a local doctor who is available for questions for guests and the doctor's group helped us reach a pediatrician. The pedeatric practise was sooooo helpful too. They reassued us that it's just a common cold/virus and even recommended we don't prepone our return plans. We are so glad we listned to them because we were able to catch all the SF attractions in the rest of the stay. Elaine was very helpful with other requests as well. For example, we requested that we be transferred to a hypo-allergenic room which she arranged right away. She even helped with restaurant recommendations, hop on hop off bus etc.The original room we stayed in did seem to have something going because we all suffered from cold or cough but I really don't want to blame it on the room or hotel because quite frankly it could be just us -may be something we caught on the plane.I guess I digressed a bit but coming back to hotel amenities, the rooms are very decent size for a major city, the upgreaded lobby is excellent, and of course, so many attractions nearby. We orderd food from room service but the quality of the food was just OK- nothing great. The in-room TV service was upgraded during our stay and the TVs now have many more channels in digital quality. Big plus if the day is rained out. As far as drawbacks, I do agree that the check in is a little confusing but personally we didn't find it to be an issue because the staff was prompt. The only bad experience we had was with valet/doorman. When we were departing, the door man called a small cab for us and when we explained we needed a bigger one because we had bags and babay stroller he just kept refusing to call another cab and even remarked that we wasted his time!! Definitely a blot on an otherwise pleasant service.",12-Dec-12,4
"Grand Hyatt is in the middle of the upscale shopping district. I stayed here the week after Thanksgiving and was in a shoppers paradise! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Decor is modern, stylish, yet still comfortable. I used to stay at the Westin St Francis when in town, but I am officially abandoning it in favor of the Grand Hyatt!",11-Dec-12,5
Perfect location at Union Square. Parking garage a block away. Best service from employees you will get. I love the Peninsula in Chicago but the service here is even better. Literally they open the door with a smile as soon as you walk in. The rooms are fantastic and we had an awesome room with perfect water views. Interior looked brand new and super clean.Bathroom immaculate. Rooms super quiet. This hotel is a must stay if you are going to San Fran. I honestly cant imagine staying at another hotel in San Fran after having stayed here,10-Dec-12,5
Great hotel- well priced and friendly staff. No complaints but for the pesky kids who had pressed the call button for all 30 odd floors before exiting :)Nice location by union square.Did not try the food here though.,10-Dec-12,4
"Really nice hotel in the heat of Union square. Shopping on your door step and an easy stroll to little Italy, China Town and Fishermans Wharf.The top level bar is a must to visit (even if you don't drink) to see the view.Service was fantasic; we stayed here as part of our honeymoon and were provided with a nice bottle of red and a cheese platter upon arrival which was a nice touch.",9-Dec-12,4
"Perfect location, wonderful service..rooms renovated and very clean. All of the little amenities, refrig in room, auto blinds that raise and lower with view of city...I just loved my room...very quiet floor. The staff were all very nice, welcomed you back each time....opened doors..nice location right next to Union Square...absolutely the best. I will be back...",9-Dec-12,5
"Owners of this property really have done their homework when deciding for the location of the hotel. Despite the fact I am a first-time traveller to San Francisco, I dare to say the location is second to none. And I do not mean Downtown SF or Union Sq., I mean the exact hotel address at 345 Stockton St at Sutter St. And the reason I state this so enthusiasticaly is that while being at walking distance from Union Sq (30 secs to be exact), the hotel is opposite to Macy's and other stores where crowds and beggars tend to populate.About the King Room at 23rd floor I was assigned to: size-wise it is just right, well-furnitured, convenient coffee machine, excellent internet-enabled TV, excellent bed, complimentary wi-fi or paid higher-speed ones, excellent bathroom facilities and good closet space, very silent, nice view from Financial District and rooftops along Sutter St and partial view of the SF bay with beautiful sunrise.Cons: windows seemed like never been washed, what ruined what would be a perfect twilight photo, I could use some more hanger space on the bathroom, you have to remember to put your privacy doorknob lable out otherwise staff may barge in, found significant amount of dirt in less accessible areas behind bed and you have to be careful while opening the shower at night as cleaning staff may have directed it outwards and a splash incidend may occur if not careful.About the hotel, I can always say it is pricy, but I feel like I got enough value for what I paid, but I would recommend not hiring internet unless really necessary and prefer having breakfast outside because 50+ USD for a couple seemed a litlle bit overpriced for me, especially considering you are 1 min walking distance from Sears Fine Foods and Loris Diner and 10 secs away from Starbucks across Stockton St. Would I look any further for my next stay in SF? I very much doubt so.",8-Dec-12,4
"Stayed this past weekend, the remodeled lobby, restaurant and bar had all opened up only 2 weeks prior. The remodel is very nice, with 2 gas fireplaces in the cozy lobby seating area. The restaurant has been re-located to the mezzanine level, along with the bar, and these are open to the lobby below. They spent some serious money on the furnishings and fixtures, but beware there are no views like from the Grandviews bar and restaurant they replaced. They say that Grandviews will no longer be a public area, and be converted into meeting room space. Sad, as this was a very nice feature of this property with impressive views from the 36th floor.  Check in was prompt, but slightly confusing, as staff each are situated at small desks with laptops. It seems they are going for a boutique hotel look, but when you have over 500 rooms and no intuitive way to queue up, it gets crowded. The doormen were always very efficient at hailing cabs and providing directions. There's also a lot of staff standing around by the elevators and I could never figure out exactly what their jobs were. The breakfast buffet is very good, and is $25 a person, though service seemed a bit unsteady. Perhaps the staff is still very new. Rooms were nice and very clean. No curtains. There are some light plastic movable shades, and then a roll down room darkening shade powered by switches next to the bed. Room was very quiet while I was there, except on Saturday night during a massive rain and wind storm the building's steel structure squeaked and groaned for hours, keeping us awake. I was surprised that no robes were provided in the room, and after 2 phone requests for 2 bathrobes, only 1 ever showed up. Also, newspapers for elite members are not delivered to the door as at other Hyatts, but are left in the elevator lobby. The bathroon did have a great shower, and hot water was abundant each morning. A very welcome touch was that the room had a mini-fridge that was empty so that you could stock your own drinks in it for your stay. No mini bar. There are a couple convenience stores within a block or two of the hotel along Sutter Street. You are also almost right on Union Square, and the heart of San Francisco's shopping district. Literally every major department store and boutique has an outlet within a few block radius of the Grand Hyatt.Overall, a nice renovation job, and I would stay here again, if just for the location. They do have a few kinks to work out training personnel, but hopefully this will be accomplished very soon. I do hope they will re-open the 36th floor bar space again someday.",6-Dec-12,4
"First the good: the location is great and the housekeeping staff are prompt and courteous.Now the bad: check is very confusing. There seems be a lot of people standing around in the lobby area, more as security than to be helpful. They could use more people in concierge as there was constantly a line up there. The walls between the walls are pretty thin. Tried the restaurant and it was overpriced for the quality. Had only recently re-opened so hopefully it will get better. Had a club room....breakfast was great but the appies and desserts in the evening always ran out within about 1/2 hour. It was quite used but could use a bit more food. Pretty average in my opinion.",5-Dec-12,3
"We arrived in San Francisco during what many said was the worst rain storm in years. We didn't know what to expect from the hotel, other than we knew it was upscale and appeared to be in a good area of the city. It was very easy to locate from the BART, which we took into the city from SFO Airport. We checked in easily and our room was beautiful with an excellent view of the city. The concieage was very helpful with directions and things to do in the city in the rain. The hotel provided us with large umbrellas which proved to be very necessary during our trip. The hotel is very close to Chinatown, the BART, the cable cars and there are excellent value-priced restaurants in the area. We did have breakfast at the hotel one day as it was included in the price of the hotel, however we would not recommend it if it's not. It was very expensive for the buffet ($25 per person) and while the food was good, it was not worth the price. The windows in our room rattled all night due to the storm and the hotel was very nice in addressing this concern. If staying in San Francisco again we would consider staying here.",3-Dec-12,4
"Hyatt has done an excellent job with the re-model, giving the hotel a contemporary, elegant look. Every single staff member was friendly and transmitted a warm feeling that made us feel at home throughout our stay. Small touches like excellent bathroom lighting for makeup and fast wireless internet in guest rooms show the detail that went into this hotel. The concierge took care of several reservations and airport transportation via email before we arrived. The only negative is that we had to wait for elevators at times - we hope this is a temporary glitch that will be corrected. Will definitely stay here again.",2-Dec-12,5
"This newly and nicely refurbished hotel is in a really good location for a trip to San Francisco. It's a short walk from the main shopping areas, cable car lines and BART Station which I used to get to and from SFO airport. There's a Starbucks right across the street and a large drugstore just around the corner. The view from my 24th floor Bay View room was superb. The bed was comfortable, there's an in-room safe and a fridge which is free to use. Minor negatives are the TVs are not HD and the bathroom sink is designed for style over function. The Business Center has 2 computers but you have to pay for internet access - there is free Wi-Fi in the very pleasant seating area in the Lobby however. There was no Grand Views restaurant on the top floor during my stay in November 2012 so I didn't use the hotel restaurant for any meals (the view would have been the major draw) - it's now on the Mezzanine Level above the lobby. The staff were friendly and helpful during my very pleasant 7 night stay and I would definitely return here again.",1-Dec-12,4
"Arrived after 3 year's absence. Lobby and fireplace sitting area was new. Stayed on the 32nd floor in a Club room. Now room is modern and comfortable. TV comes with Internet capabilities, cool. Some amenities missing like slippers, bed was too soft and wouldn't work for someone with a bad back. Concierge is tried and true for many years. They give good info",30-Nov-12,4
"This is one of the best hotels in the Union Square area of San Francisco. Although it does not share the same classic and stunning lobbies like other more historical hotels nearby, the interior is newly renovated. There is something to be said about walking into a place that smells new and fresh (in our case the lobby is still off-gassing when we walked into the lobby!) My husband and I were in town for a convention. The location is great for attending events, do some shopping, etc. In contrast to San Francisco's other quaint neighborhoods, downtown San Francisco has a more corporate and 'big city' feel. So if you are looking for charm and personality, this neighborhood is not it. The hotel looks like every other Hyatt property in the world. The room looks beautiful at first glance, but once you start to use the space in more detail, things begin to fall apart. In some cases it literally does. The headboard started to wobble when we pulled the attached nightstand drawers. There are plenty of wood furniture, cabinets, and drawers in the room, but none provided very much storage. There are a lot of knick-knacks all over the place, but the overall effect is not cohesive. A little too much fussy fluff for my taste. The 'modern' interior decoration is mediocre at best. It is a case of one corporate hotel looking just like another corporate hotel, while trying to out do each other.The lighting in the room is overall very dark. The only highlight, no pun intended, is the bathroom. The overly bright spot of the whole room, the bathroom is actually the best looking part of the room. Other awkward lighting controls includes a funky silver semi-translucent full-height window screen in the room that don't look like it can last more than five years.The service throughout the hotel is consistently friendly and good natured. Everyone we came across is top notch endearing. The porter is very responsive and helpful. The cleaning lady for our room is very responsive as well. When we left her a thank you note one day, she wrote a response back to us with a smiley face.Back to the bathroom. The water pressure at the shower on the 16th floor is pathetically poor. You would think a semi-modern high-rise would have resolved that technical problem. You are literally being washed by something a little bit better than the drips of water torture. At least the water is warm.Now to the Internet. They charge you a certain amount per day for high-speed premium Internet access. This service sucked. The Internet speed is excessively slow for us. It was okay when I just have to surf and dilly dally. But it was not okay when I have to do work. I called their Internet support immediately. The man was very helpful. Unfortunately that was halfway during our stay and we already suffered the poor service for a while.The parking is $55 per night. There is a cheaper lot directly diagonally across from the hotel. But they also charge some exorbitant amount per night. My advice is, if you can help it, do not drive in downtown San Francisco.Did I mention although the bed was very comfortable, it was sagging? There was a noticeable higher ridge along the middle of the bed. I guess most people don't sleep in the middle of a king bed.",26-Nov-12,4
"Love this hotel, service is generally excellent, staff is great and the hotel has done a very good job with their remodel. Stayed here twice in the last few months and was very impressed with the rooms and what you get for the price. Service was excellent and the staff is always attentive and helpful. For a large SFO hotel that is unusual.",26-Nov-12,4
"Loved the modern decor & the hotel overall! The only reasons I didn't rate ""excellent"" across the board. 1) not enough drawer space in the room 2) even though we were on a ""quiet floor"" you can hear the people in the next room (literally when they flush their toilet). The room rate was pretty high but that's the going rate for a nice hotel in Union Square. I found the most reasonable rate through the hotel's website (pre-pay, non-refundable). With that said, everything else was wonderful! They let us check-in early & beds/pillows were amazingly comfortable. ",25-Nov-12,4
"The location near Union Square is nearly unmatched (only a few others right on the square.). The rooms feel luxurious including remote blinds and elegant bath fixtures. The lobby and check in are modern -- very upscale. Valet (as one can expect in SFO) is fantastic. Unfortunately the rest of the staff, especially dining, seemed untrained and lacking sophistication for this level. I agree with other reviewers that moving the restaurant and bar from the 36th floor to ""one Up"" was a massive misstep. Moreover the restaurant seems to be suffering from serious freshman jitters. Food is sufferably slow in coming. Hours of operation seem to be erratic and subject to chef irrational preparation. That said when and if the food arrives it is spectacular. I can only hope they figure out the service irregularities as I do hope to return again with better dining experiences. ",25-Nov-12,4
"It's been 7 years since I wrote my last review. We have been staying here several times a year for about 20 years. With the recent remodel, it's now one of the very best hotels in the city. The rooms, especially on the Regency Club floors, are nothing short of spectacular, both with their views, impeccible service in the Club, and the beautiful materials which have been used in the guest rooms. The huge lighted mirrors in the bathrooms seem to make everyone look 20 years younger ! The views from rooms on the north facing side of the hotel give the very best views, which include Coit Tower, the Pyramid, and Alcatraz. The new lobby is beautiful and has individual desks rather than a single front desk. There is a new sitting area with a gas fireplace. However, the new bar is directly above and open to the lobby and on this Saturday night pulsating music from above was annoying. This beautiful hotel still is about the most centrally located in the city -across the street from Union Square - and in the heart of the shopping area. I can recommend it without hesitation.",24-Nov-12,5
"Like most frequent business travelers, I keep a mental list of which hotels really do it right (and which do not...) The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is absolutely at the top of my list! From the personalized attention upon check in, the doormen, the concierge, room service delivery - all are top notch. The eleventh floor room I stayed in was lovely and very comfortable. I am both picky and brutally honest - so I would tell you if I found anything to complain about, but I did not.As a fine example of the care they take of their guests here, I called downstairs to see if I could get some band aids - I said I needed several. The young lady response was to ask - with great concern in her voice - if I was ok. I just don't think most places care like that. (I just had blisters - take your most comfortable shoes! San Francisco is a *walking* town.) And further - they were at my door with those band aids faster than I would have thought possible.When I have occasion to travel to San Francisco in the future, you can be sure that this is where I'll stay. I recommend it unreservedly.",23-Nov-12,5
"The hotel is centrally located just off union square, rooms are a good size and have great views over the city. Staff service was excellent.I usually stay over the road at the Taj, but I think this will be my new regular SF hotel.",23-Nov-12,5
"We have been staying at this hotel every time we have come to San Francisco (two times minimum per year) for the past ten years. Our last visit was for a week in April, when they had remodeled the rooms to a somewhat more Oriental flavor. One of the reasons we have always stayed there was the Grandview Lounge on the 36th floor.It had the best view in all of San Francisco and we spent many hours watching the ships and boats in ther harbor. Imagine our shock the find that, in the final part of the remodel, they have moved the bar and restaurant to the 4th floor, a box with no view!!! They took the best feature of their hotel and turned it into a conference area/private room. There are many very good hotels near the Square, but the biggest factor we always chose the Grand Hyatt was the view from the lounge! Very sad.",21-Nov-12,3
"We managed to pick our days about a week after the hotel completed remodeling. Our room had a great view over Union Square (as often noted this hotel has a great location) and was done in a contemporary style. The TV setup wasn't complete (should be very soon) but remained usable - just the channels available didn't match the guide. Nicely done bath, albeit a small counter, probably because it was handicap accessible and needed more room in some areas.Very pleased with the new restaurant for breakfast (a separate review). The bar was excellent (a good selection of wine by the glass at (for SF) reasonable prices. Quick check in and out. Everything we could have expected and it's tops on our list for next time.",20-Nov-12,5
We stayed four nights in November 2012 at the SF Grand Hyatt located in Union Square. The Union Square area is convenient and feels relatively safe for tourists. Lots to do and see there as well. The recent room rennovations were excellent! Everything was new and fresh. The desk staff and concierge were helpful to me and my guests. When we were there they were in the process of completing rennovations on the lobby and restaurant. We were told this via email in advance so that this was not a surprise. My only disappointment was that the restaurant on site where I took the group for lunch was buffet only. This would have been fine but they ran out of food right away and the food they had was disappointing. Small complaint for a lovely property!,20-Nov-12,5
"we stayed at the grand hyatt while my husband was attending a show. The location was absolutely perfect, right in the heart of union square. The breakfast was outstanding and Scott the mixologist at the bar was fabulous. The concierge was so helpful (all of them) with restaurants, tours, and shoppping, and anything else we might want. Check in via the laptops in the lobby was a breeze as was check out. I would have preferred to be on a much higher floor, but we had a fabulous rate because of the show, so no complaints. The bed was extremely comfortable. i will stay there again when i return to this magnificent city by the bay!!",19-Nov-12,5
"Stayed in 2008 and really enjoyed it so returned again in November 2012. Hotel had nearly completed its renovations. Had a great room on 31st floor with bay views. Everything went smoothly from checking in with Wayne, meeting David and Jimmy again in the Club Lounge, and everything else was perfect. Friendly polite staff made the hotel stand out from other hotels. Will definitely return to this hotel when next in San Francisco.Fantastic powerful shower and really modern bathroom. Liked the welcome button that turned the lights on and raised the electric blind!",19-Nov-12,5
"From check-in through check-out, the staff of the Hyatt was terrific. This hotel has a lot going for it beyond service. Beautiful new bar and restaurant on the Mezzanine; very cool setup for check-in; comfortable beds; nice HVAC system in room; sliding door allows fresh air for the room; well-appointed bath.I did not provide an excellent review because internet service was very slow and there was a fee for it; high speed internet was more expensive ($15/day) but worked well. There was no lounge chair in my room and the chair for the desk was not height adjustable. Taxi service in SF is lousy in SF and even worse at this location, likely due to construction a block away. But it is a convenient walk to great shopping, restaurants and the Moscone Center. I recommend it!",18-Nov-12,4
"Was informed at check-in the the renovations had ""just finished"" and it looked it. Lobby, lounge and room were all gorgeous. The room was nicely equipped - hooray for lots of electrical outlets for device charging. Very comfy bed, nice bathroom, plenty of room to unpack if you're staying a few nights.Location is great. Right in the middle of major shopping, a quick walk to the BART/Muni and if you're touring around town in a car, this is fairly easy to get to.If you do bring a car, you're going to experience SF parking rates... and this hotel is no different. Not cheap to use valet overnight here.Pretty quiet room for being in such an urban setting. Would definitely stay here again.",18-Nov-12,5
Stayed here a few weeks ago for an overnight stay. The lobby was under construction but check-in was great due to an awesome unexpected early check-in and free upgrade to a corner room on the 21st floor. The rooms have been completely renovated and look FAB as do the hallways. My only complaint was that the doorman talked us into parking across the street - saving us $15 with in and out privileges. The only problem was that the service at the garage was EXTREMELY slow. You had to get aggressive with the guys in order for them to help you. The lines to get our car were long and one time it took nearly 20 minutes to get the car. To me it wasn't worth saving $15. We had a few drinks at the rooftop bar one of favorites hotel bars in the city. We were sad to find out that the bar was closing for good in a few days to make room for ballroom space. We had lots of good memories at that place - its the end of an era. But the completely revamped Grand Hyatt is a new beginning.,17-Nov-12,5
"It was a great stay.Stayed there for 4 nigths.The location is so good,the stuff were really freindly and the check in was quickly done,we took 2 rooms with a connecting door as we were a family of 5,2 adults and 3 children,the rooms were all new,the bath was big and spacy,the decoration was very nice and pleasent to see,great sink!!!the beds were very very comfortable,and allthuogh the hotel was in renovation we didnt feel it at all.The rooms were very clean..The consierge was very helpfull and gave as directions and explenations.Across and down the road is the-cheese cake factory resturant,which was excellent and we enjoyed it alot,dont forget to reserve !!Dont think twice!!!this hotel is a must!!if you want your stay to be pleasent and worth it!!",17-Nov-12,5
"I had the opportunity to visit this hotel yesterday and WOW! The remodel of public areas appears complete and it was jaw dropping!I've stayed in one of the remodeled rooms (which was very nice), but hadn't been to the hotel since its public areas were remodeled. The new restaurant and lounge are now on the 2nd floor mezzanine and it creates great buzz. So smart - very hip, but not in a creepy ""we are trying to be a club"" feel. I didn't try the restaurant out yet (I peeked in), but the lobby lounge was great. The restaurant and lounge are separated by a long walkway that is a wine cellar of sorts. They are open to exterior windows so you see the city and it creates great energy. I can't wait to go back! I don't know what they are going to do with the old restaurant and lounge on top floor, but they were rather sad and needed to be retired anyway.The concierge desk is smartly placed, new seating in the lobby for guests is great with a cool fireplace. There are video screens everywhere - showing tranquil scenes. Even the etching on the glass of San Francisco map is totally cool. The stone flooring, warmth of wood ... it all works beautifully.I loved the front desk ... it is just a collection of counters with laptops. Super inviting.The staff were all very welcoming - they must be excited to have this total revamp. And the doorman looks like a doorman (maybe he had same uniform before, but I don't think so.) It really felt like everything had been revamped. It feels like a brand new hotel! The outdoor planters are wonderful and welcome you as approach the hotel. It used to be drab (and that is being generous). Now the hotel inside and out is alive and inviting. I really was blown away - and you will be too. It truly is a ""grand"" hotel now! Bravo! I highly recommend this hotel.",15-Nov-12,5
We stayed here for 3 nights in November at the end of our USA trip and were very impressed. We booked the free Hyatt time deal through Hyatt and paid 2 nights and got our third night for free and got free breakfast each day. The hotel was recently renovated and we were given a free upgrade upon arrival to the 29th floor so it only added to our experience. Staff were all helpful and friendly and I found the staff at the 1-up restaurant to be excellent. We loved the Buffett breakfast. It was ll fresh and organic ingredients and was beautiful. The beds were so comfortable. Only one flaw was there was not Dsney or Nickoleon Chanel's for kids. Would highly recommend.,15-Nov-12,5
"Stayed for a couple of nights this past week after the lobby renovation was complete. Very nice looking lobby with a casual check-in, beautiful fireplaces and sitdown areas. Check-in was efficient, but not very accommodating with regards to asking for a different room view.Room was very nice and everything appeared brand new as they completely gutted their rooms and updated them with wood floors, nice walk-in shower, and very comfy beds.Ordered room service and it was fine, nothing outstanding, but came very quickly and the server was very friendly.Location is excellent- right across Union Square from Macy's and within walking distance to a ton of shops and restaurants.My main issue was the fact that they've spend millions on renovating their rooms, a big, new lobby and restaurant, nice new tv's, but no HDTV signal in their guestroom!? C'mon, this is 2012- almost every decent hotel has HDTV signals broadcast. Might not be a big issue to some, but I enjoy watching sports and non-HDTV is almost enough to turn me away in the future.",14-Nov-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt just completed a much needed renovation of its public spaces and the new version is much improved. The lobby has a modern, yet warm feel to it and the staff could not be any friendlier. The new restaurant, OneUp, has a limited menu but the food quality is outstanding. I got the lamb burger for lunch and it was one of the better burgers I have ever eaten. The Regency Club lounge at this property is one of the best in the US as the views alone are worth the additional cost. From the Regency Club you get a panorama of one of the most beautiful cities in the country. The food in the Regency Club is excellent and the staff (Dave and others) are incredibly helpful and friendly. The workout facility is on the smaller side for such a nice hotel but the equipment is new and well maintained. The concierge, JoAnna, is friendly and very knowledgeable about local restaurants and activities.My room was a double on the 32nd floor. The rooms are moderate in size but have new amenities including a very comfortable bed and a large flat screen TV.This hotel is centrally located, very close to Union Square, close to the BART Station (Powell Street) and close to the Terminus of the famous SF Cable Car (Powell Line). I took that BART in from the airport and then walked 4 blocks to the hotel. The BART ticket cost me almost $9 but was far less expensive than a taxi ride into the city which will run about $50 with tip. The ride in on BART was 30 minutes and I am sure that rush hour traffic would have resulted in a 45 minute taxi ride, at least. The hotel is also very close to the Financial District, for those in SF on business.",14-Nov-12,5
"My new home in San Francisco. Construction was complete by my arrival and the combination of warm, retro, chic cozy is a perfect pairing for the city. The checking is open and friendly with individual check in at large tables. Fireplace huge living rooms grace the lobby with spa music playing in the backgroundThe rooms a retro colors of golden, sand and brown put together in a very sleek configuration. Love the vibe, location and service",13-Nov-12,5
"Check-in was quick and efficient, lobby was under contruction but the staff did its utmost to limit the impact to its guest. Good rooms clean and spacious.Disappointing was the bar and restaurant. In particular the breakfast buffet was up to standard - if I was staying at a Holiday Inn. The buffet was rarely open on time, drinks arriving late, etc. The construction in the lobby was to create a new bar and restuarant but it seemed that they had already closed down. Too bad because the view from the bar and restaurant is awesome.Great hotel - and I expect the new bar and restaurant to be better organised...",12-Nov-12,3
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a week in early October and it was an absolute pleasure to stay here. I was in San Francisco during an extremely busy week for the city, with all the events on (the Oracle Convention, Americaâ€™s Cup, Fleet Week, the Blue Angels Air Shows, Castro Street Fair, and the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival).Yes, the hotel Lobby was being renovated (due to be completed in November) and the main temporary entrance was located on Sutter Street, but that was nothing to be worried about. As soon as I stepped out of the taxi in front of the hotel, the service I received from staff was exceptional. All the staff members I spoke to were very helpful and professional (the bellmen, front desk, concierge, club lounge and housekeeping staff). They all provided top notch service and were very willing to help when needed.The room was beautiful. It was designed in a way that just felt welcoming and very comfortable, with lots of space and storage. I had a room on one of the higher floors, so it was quiet & the view was spectacular. I loved coming back to my room after a long day of exploring the city to unwind & go to sleep in a very comfortable bed. I would also lower the darkening shade on the window before I went to sleep, so I wasnâ€™t woken up by a bright room in the morning. The bathroom was also larger than I had expected.The hotel is right in the middle of Union Square and is very centrally located.You can walk all over the city from there, or easily find connections to public transport within a few blocks (buses, trains, streetcars and cable cars).Otherwise the bellmen can call a taxi for you, right outside the front door.I really enjoyed my stay at the Grand Hyatt, thoroughly recommend it and would stay here again if I get another chance to travel back to San Francisco!",12-Nov-12,5
"We stayed here for 8 days in late October to early November 2012. The entrances were a little screwed up because of construction and remodeling, but it didn't interfere with any of our plans. We stayed in 1620 and overlooked the Union Square plaza. Room was comfortable and quiet. Daily housekeeping was consistently good. I'd recommend to others without reservation - not in the literal sense of course ... probably should have a reservation before arriving. :)",11-Nov-12,4
"This hotel is in an awesome location in union square, right smack in the middle of the shopping district. If you're in town for the stores, then this is the perfect hotel for you. Barney's, Macy's, Nike's, Levi's etc are just some of the examples which are within walking distance of no further than 10 mins. Besides shopping, the location is also easily accessible for walking to Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach and Chinatown. For example, on our second day, we walked to the Ferry Terminal Building for the farmer's market and this was also easily achievable; about 20 mins of leisurely walking. The hotel is currently undergoing renovation, and therefore it might be slightly troublesome dagging your luggage from the taxi stand round the hotel to the makeshift lobby. Other than that, we experienced no inconvenience. The room was clearly newly renovated and I don't know if it was the fatgue of having travelled for close to 1.5 weeks by the time we reached San Fran, but the bed was extremely comfortable. We were out like a light every night. We will definitely be returning to this hotel when we are next in San Fran.",9-Nov-12,5
"While the finishing touches are still being applied, the new bar on 2nd floor looks amazing - and the renovations to the lobby, guest rooms, etc put it on my short list of business hotels I'd stay at when traveling for fun.",8-Nov-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt is situated in a really central spot next to Union Square. There are lots of shops, restaurants, bars within walking distance and the area feels relatively safe at night (I'm a single gal so that's really important to me). I chose a room that was hypoallergenic. At first I wasn't sure how much I'd appreciate that feature but once I entered the room, it was pristine and I felt like I would get a good night's rest. The bathroom was lovely and the bed was exceedingly comfortable. There's a nice desk area which I appreciated for my work. My room had a view of an ice skating rink down below that was put up for the holidays. Fun if you're visiting sometime in the next couple of months.My only real complaint would be my walls were pretty thin. My next door neighbor was on his phone all night and early in the morning and I heard every cough and every sneeze. I typically just drink coffee in my room in the morning and I thought the in-room coffee was pretty bad but there's a Starbucks across the street so no real harm done there. Yes, as many people have written before me - the hotel is currently under construction but staff were very good about directing me where to go. The big downfall to the construction from my perspective was really just the lack of a real lobby (who spends that much time in the lobby anyway?) :)All in all, I found the staff to be very friendly and the hotel to be an excellent choice (particularly for business travel).",8-Nov-12,4
"I have stayed here several times over the past year, and with the exception of my first stay, the service has been extraordinary. The first time I stayed here a few months ago, the service of the front desk wasn't very welcoming, and I wasn't expecting construction at the hotel either which was a little inconvenient at first. I wasn't thanked for being a platinum member either, as I normally am at other Hyatts. However, that experience was short lived, because every stay after that has been a 180 degree turnaround from the first. The staff has since been super friendly after that first experience, always welcoming me back (I love when hotels recognize return guests) and even remembering my name, as well as my dog's name! Construction is still fairly inconvenient, but the quality of service, as well as the rooms make up for the inconvenience. The rooms are very nice, contemporary and very clean. I have always requested a high floor, and with availability, they have never had a problem honoring my request. The higher floors have AMAZING views. Each room has floor to ceiling windows with automatic blinds that you can operate while lying in bed. I'm also very particular about bathrooms at hotels, and I have nothing to complain about with these ones -- They are always spotless (I always look at corners, and dirt between tiles, etc.), and showers have a detachable head and plenty of counter space. The location is another plus with this hotel. It's located almost in the heart of Union Square, only a few blocks from Chinatown, in a crowded part of town, so to be able to walk out of the hotel and down the street to shop, eat, or sightsee without having to deal with taxis, parking or public transportation is awesome. I have to say that the only drawback would be the noise from the downtown streets late at night. Although the windows seem to block out most noise, I could still faintly hear echos of crowds of people, concerts, trucks, etc. even from the higher floors. But the noise from outside has only been a minor thing.This hotel is one of my favorites to stay at in San Francisco, and I have stayed in many. A colleague noticed me say a few times: ""I'm going home"" instead of ""I'm going back to my hotel"" which shows the kind of sentiment I feel being there.",7-Nov-12,5
"I recently stayed at this hotel for work. I added on a few extra days to be a tourist while I was in town. The hotel was chosen by work but was a good starting off point for the vacation portion of the trip. The hotel is a block off Union Square and easily accessible to public transportation. The cable car is only a block away on Powell. The hotel is still undergoing construction in the lobby, but the room was renovated and very nice. The controls for the window shades are on the wall by the bed. Took me a while to find them. The hotel restaurant was a disappointment, but they were only serving a limited buffet during the renovations. There is a 7-Eleven and a Walgreens at Powell and Sutter to grab bottled water and snacks. There is also a good restaurant, Lori's on the same corner that is open 24 hrs and has a good breakfast for a reasonable price. There is lots of shopping close to this hotel location. I mostly used the Muni and the cable car, but there is a National/Alamo location up the hill on Bush Street where I rented a car one day to drive up to Muir Woods.",5-Nov-12,4
"I stayed 6 nights in this hotel and loved the location... as well as the renovations. The lobby was still being worked on, my room on the 6th floor was great! It was spacious, modern and clean. The bed was soft but still comfortable, and the sheets were silky soft on my skin. Loved it. The location was great for both work (going to the convention center) and fun (shopping, Ferry building, restaurants). The thing I liked the least about the hotel was how thin the walls seemed to be. My neighbor was playing music one night late, which woke me up. The good part: I called down to the front desk and security came up IMMEDIATELY. I'm sure the person had no idea I could hear his/her music quite so clearly. :)",3-Nov-12,4
"Hotel has been under re-construction for three months which should be ending in 3 weeks. Rooms have been updated, furniture is great and the bed very comfortable. Window treatments make the room dark and the ac is cold. Staff is handling the construction well and are very helpful during this time. I will be abck at this hotel.",1-Nov-12,4
"Great location (5 min walk to Fishermans Wharf) and very professional staff.A bit expensive, but most Hyatts are. Room was very nice and service was great..would stay again. We had some travel laundry to do after a week in the states and the service was prompt and resonably affordable.Hagen & Dawn - Australia",30-Oct-12,4
"My husband and I were a little worried when checking into the Grand Hyatt as we'd been backpacking around the South of the US and had a load of rucksacks and gear with us, not to mention the very casual attire we were wearing! The moment we walked in we were treated like absolute gold. We had staff members rushing over to help us, and happily chatting and asking questions about where we had been travelling, even offering us water and candy!! We were upgraded to a high floor with a fantastic view over Union Square, and the room and the view were stunning!!! The staff recommended some nearby pubs and places to eat, and the easiest way to use the public transport to get to all of San Francisco's 'hot spots'. Unfortunately the gym area was closed for renovations during our stay, but that was probably a good thing as we got to spend more time out and about San Francisco, which is such a wonderful city. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff at the Grand Hyatt were by far the friendlist, most genuine hotel staff I have come across - we will definitely be back!",27-Oct-12,5
"Nice hotel, but building work was going on which was a bit rubbish as reception was half closed. Make sure you get what you pay for, they tried up downgrade us into a cheaper room as the place was busy - thought we wouldn't notice. Make sure to complain about anything that wasn't up to scratch as we got $100 of the bill when I said I wasn't happy. Great customer service!",27-Oct-12,4
"My husband and I stayed at this newly renovated hotel and we were so glad that this was the hotel we chose for our stay in San Francisco. We arrived by taxi and were greeted by the valets with a smile and a warm welcome. Check in was a breeze and we were quickly given our room and told that the bell man would escort us upstairs with our luggage. The bell man was very polite and gave us a tour of the room and asked if we needed anything or had any questions. We were on the 16th floor in a room that had great city views with a glimpse of the bay on the left and the right. Our room was spacious enough and nicely decorated. I loved the big bathroom and the dressing room adjacent to it.. Nice touch. Loved the automatic blinds that you could control from your bed. The coffee maker and fridge in the room is a nice touch as well. The room and hotel is very clean and all the staff we met or who served us were extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge staff were so helpful and lovely... Even got a lovely comment by one about how nice my hair looked today. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was very nice... the view is magnificent. The hotel is located in a superb location close to all your shopping needs and all forms of public transport. Yes the lobby was still under some construction, but that did not impinge on our stay one bit. People who whine about this are plain and outright silly. Overall a great hotel, a very comfortable room/bed and a superb location. What else do you need!",27-Oct-12,5
"My room was very nice with a fantastic view of Coit Tower and the bay. Room size was generous and the bed was very comfortable. Closet and dressing area were a nice bonus. The bathroom was great...spacious, lovely shower. Nice to have a refrigerator and small coffee maker in the room. The only downside is that the lobby was undergoing a renovation which was inconvenient. It will be completed, soon, however and will undoubtedly be nice. Location is very central to downtown, chinatown and the Embarcadero. Would definitely stay again. ",26-Oct-12,4
"We really enjoyed our two stays at this hotel, pre and post cruise from San Francisco. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Beds were terrific. Housekeeping did a great job.The front desk staff, concierge staff and bell boys were excellent.It is in a terrific location for shopping and sightseeing. Terrific views from the higher floors.My only complaint was that the foyer was undergoing renovations. Fine, I can cope with that. But the problem was that there was only one seat for visitors in the foyer. We had to stand waiting for our transfer for 45 minutes, as the only seat was taken. The staff kept looking at us and smiling, which is fine, but what I really wanted was a seat to sit on. Even a few temporary dining chairs would have been preferable to having to stand for that long a period of time. There was room for some temporary seating.Other than that, all was fine.",24-Oct-12,5
"The hotel is very good located. You are close to everything. The room was big enough and very clean. The staff was extremly friendly. The breakfast was also very good with an amazing view to San Francisco. The valet parking was also good. We almost never had to wait for our car. There was just one big problem. I had a special request to get a romatic atmosphere. We arranged everything, but they just forgot to do it. At least they didn't charge us for that. I was very dissapointed for that.",24-Oct-12,5
"stayed 5 nights because a conference was held there. The only good staff I could name is Lyle (Bellman), who was the only staff provided 5-star services.On the first night, I called the Front Desk to arrange a morning call, the guy asked me to call the operator myself (couldn't he arrange the morning call?)The message light was on, I called the operator who told me there was a voice mail and asked me to call 4747 to retrieve myself (doubt couldn't she connected me to the voice mail system?)The most unbelievable and unacceptable was I asked the banquet waiter: do you have toothpick? the answer was : Sorry, I don't have. Then he walked away and I didn't get the toothpick even after 15 minutes.View and location is excellent, but service is not up to a 'GRAND' standard.",23-Oct-12,3
Stayed four days in connection with a conference. Nice room and super service. The restaurant on 36 floor has great views but is apparantly closing in the near future. Ask for a room on a high floor! I was on third floor and there is a lot of noise from the street (people and construction). The location is perfect for business and shopping. ,23-Oct-12,4
"I felt like i was at a mediocre hotel. Having arrived close to 11pm, we couldnt find the side entrance that we were instructed to use from the website since they had construction going on at their front entrance. No signs, no one to help us outside. Even thru the front entrance, nobody cared to assist us with our 4 bags on arrival and departure. This is ""Grand"" ???Usually, as with other hotels, when one requests a corner room, one gets a true corner room with double views. We paid extra for a room that was at the ""end' of a floor but just with 1 view facing front. Seriously???Also, our door had a 1"" crack underneath that allowed a lot of hall light to keep us awake at night. Why?Then, early next morning, we couldn't even sleep in as people started vacuuming the hallway in front of our door keeping us wide awake. This is ""Grand"" ???Being on the 27th floor, the water pressure from the shower was weak. You actually had to stand almost with your nose against the wall so you could catch the weak shower flow; The room ac was a bit too warm even when set at 65 degrees.",21-Oct-12,2
"I had stayed at this hotel with my family about 10 years ago and knew it was in a prime location. My husband and I booked the hotel and were able to walk everywhere. In addition, the hotel was recently renovated and it surpassed my expectations. Very modern style, luxe feel and great views of the city. The staff were great and very helpful. I would book this hotel in a heartbeat if I were to return. I definitely recommend it if you are visiting San Francisco. You won't be disappointed.",21-Oct-12,5
"My husband and I recently spent 4 days in San Francisco and are very happy to have chosen the Grand Hyatt for our stay. While the lobby was under construction, it wasn't an inconvenience at all. Our room was great with nice upgrades. Comfortable bed, big bathroom, and a fabulous view of Union Square. Very friendly staff. Excellent rooftop bar with beautiful views of the city. Highly recommend this hotel. Great location, too!",21-Oct-12,5
"Hotel is being renovated but we knew that when we booked so wasn't really a problem. Staff were polite and helpful in arrival and we were able to access our rooms straight away (about 10 am) and also get a late check out for one of our rooms, on our last day(we had 2 rooms as SF hotel Rooms are really to small to comfortably accommodate 2 adults and 2 teens). We didn't use in house dining as so many options close by.Our rooms were newly refurbished and very pleasant. The views were stunning. Beds comfortable and showers good. I was really disappointed in the Internet access, firstly you had to pay (which is unusual these days and seems petty) and then I couldn't get it to work (on my iPhone - surely nothing complicated) the hotel staff really not interested in helping. Ended up going to Starbucks every time needed to use it which worked fine but I expected more from the Hyatt. Location is perfect if you want to shop, lots of options any direction you walk in. ",20-Oct-12,4
"Stayed at the hotel while on business in SF.A few hassles with arrival as the lobby is currently under construction but once past that had a good stay. Rooms are decent size and well appointed. Feels like they have been upgraded in the not too distant past. The restarraunt on the top floor has just okay food but amazing views. If you go for an early breakfast, watching the sunrise over the city is NICE!",19-Oct-12,4
"There is a bit of construction in the lobby area but the rooms were very clean and modernized. The service was great. The room service breakfast was very good. And the central location of the hotel was wonderful. Very nice views and a very good restaurant on the 37th floor. The restaurant will be replaced by a banquet room. So sad to see the restaurant on the top floor go because we saw a beautiful sunset from our dinner table. All in all, a great stay.",18-Oct-12,5
"My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt in San Fran on a particularly busy weekend for the city (Fleet Week, Air Shows, Blues Festivals, 49ers and America's Cup). A Hyatt should be able to stand up to these events. We knew that the lobby was being renovated but there was a total lack of signage to direct guests where they needed to go and there was no doorman at the makeshift entrance to the hotel to mark the entrance and provide direction. The check in process was totally underwhelming. The woman provided no information on the hotel, or the city and was incredibly aloof. Initially I thought the room we were in was one of the unrenovated rooms.... turns out it wasn't. Granted the colour scheme was not to my taste but even if it was, it was cheaply finished and already had chips taken out of the veneer of the bedside tables. The bathrooms are not bright enough and the bath so small it was pointless to have one in there at all.We had arranged for tickets to be sent to hotel prior to our arrival. Obviously we confirmed this was ok prior to the booking to tickets, we then confirmed that they had been received. We then spent two anxious days while concierge attempted to locate them. Until this point my husband was pretty positive about the hotel, he then tried to organise a restaurant via the concierge, after that experience he was well over the concierge and the hotel. I understand that the city was busy and there were a lot of guests but perhaps additional staff during the turmoil of the renovation might make the guests feel welcomed and satisfied with their stay. Even without the renovation our experience was disappointing and I will certainly never stay there again. If you are paying for a fancy hotel you expect a certain level of service, The Hyatt did not deliver on basic elements let alone the inconvenience of the renovation.",17-Oct-12,2
"Lobby is under construction, doesn't feel like a 4 star hotel. Breakfast is only served from 6.30am which is a shame as business people starts their day at 7.00am. Fortunatelly there is a Starbucks around the corner. Room was very noisy, you can hear all noises from the street (actually I thought the window was open...but that was not the case). Very unpleasant. Otherwise rooms are fine and large. Bathroom is great.",16-Oct-12,3
Our three day stay was enjoyable but for three things.1.Incinvenience with renovations.2.At this rate thought wi fi would have been include3.Transfer booked and paid for previous night to early morning flight was never booked by staff hence last minute panic to make flight.,15-Oct-12,3
"We stayed here just for a quick 1 day trip on 9/22. We choose this hotel because its location, just across from Union square. We got there at noon, almost able to checked in right away but another front desk checked in another guest while we were thinking about whether to take the room or not. So, we checked in our luggage and went out for shopping. In 1 hour the hotel called and informed me that the room is ready. The room was clean, new and also have contemporary design to it. This hotel is also undergoing renovation to all rooms and also the lobby. So, the lobby is a bit messy and seemed smaller. The bathroom has a big mirror with back lighting, very big and long sink. Tub and shower combination with Hyatt portico amenities. The bed was comfortable and new. The view from the room was ok. The fitness center was small and probably they will refurbish it later. I love that they provide cold towel and Ice water dispenser by the entrance to fitness center. No swimming pool is the only draw back. All the staff were great and very professional. I recommend this hotel and would love to go back again.",15-Oct-12,4
They are doing a nice job on the hotel but the lobby is a bit messy with all the areas under construction. Entry is now on Sutter St. Can be confusing. But the rooms which have been remodeled look great and the updated bathrooms are nice. We had a suite and it was very large and comfortable. No complaints about the room and the furniture comfortable as well. The Club room on the 32nd floor for the diamond gold passport members is terrific. Great foods and service. Stunning views of the water and bay.,15-Oct-12,4
"Great hotel, Great Location. We flew in from Australia and after travelling the better part of 20 hours we were looking for a bit of comfort, and we found it here. Central to most things and easy to commute from with public transport all around. We had breakfast included in the room price and it did not disappoint. My goodness the buffet was endless and the views are second to none. Just amazing watching the fog roll in down the bay from the 36th floor. Staff were helpful and polite and made check in and out absolutely seamless. If I ever return I'd definitely come back to stay. Nice one grand Hyatt !!",13-Oct-12,5
"We stayed at this hotel for a week. We asked for a quiet room high up and away from street noise. We were given an end unit on the 12th floor next to the housekeeping door. Street and construction noise were still heard so we had to run the air conditioning to get ""white noise"" to cover the unwanted sounds. The rooms were renovated but the windows which opened slightly were not replaced. The housekeeping door opened and closed very early in the morning. The lobby was under construction but they had sufficient staff for check-in and getting our luggage to the room. The newly renovated rooms were very nicely appointed and the electronic blackout current worked well. The coffee makers and supplies in the room were sanitary and easy to use. We got additional towels but had to keep asking for additional towels each time they made up the room. We thought that what they removed would automatically be replaced. The concierge service over the week was inconsistent. Some of the concierge provided very good and accurate information and recommendations while others were not as good or complete. The location was very convenient for shopping, dining and sightseeing. We felt safe around the hotel and there were many attractions to which you could walk.",13-Oct-12,4
"Stayed here for a few night on my last trip to San Francisco and had a nice stay. The hotel was just finishing the refurbishing of the lobby so everything was a bit rough, and there was a convention in town so everything was fully booked.They still managed to get me a nice room with a view of the Coit tower and the water, very nice. I also appreciated the nice bathroom. The Club lounge is big but only average in quality in my opinion, but nice to spend some time with an even better view.The gym is also good and also has a view (another part) of the city and the Bay. Will stay there again when in town.",12-Oct-12,4
"We stayed 2 nights. The hotel exceeded expectations. We weren't aware of the renos taking place in the lobby. It was a bit of an inconvenience, but the hotel more than compensated by offering us free wifi and breakfast each day. The location is great. We especially enjoyed the lounge on the 36th floor. Wonderful views. Would definitely stay here again.",11-Oct-12,4
"San Francisco was the last stop on a 12 day trip along the coast from Seattle. We were so happy to reach the ""big city"" and it didn't disappoint.The hotel lobby is under construction but the staff never missed a beat. Don't know if they are always this accomodating but they were wonderful. Newly decorated room was fabulous. Electric room darkening shades were very cool. Bed was yummy. Our package price included breakfast which was served in the 37th floor restaurant. It was packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings but the staff was incredible. To placate folks for the wait they took our orders for a beverage while we stood in line and we even got our herb tea before sitting down. When we did get our table and began to enjoy a scrumptious buffet, it seemed the staff knew what we wanted/needed before we even looked around to request something. I have traveled alot and was very surprised - pleasantly of course - at the quality of the service. Just amazing.Concierge helped several different ways. We were able to print our boarding passes in the lobby. GREAT experience.",9-Oct-12,5
"I was attending a conference at the Moscone Center and though this was a 15 min walk (ok 20+min walk in heels), it was through Union Square and lovely shops and stores. My room faced Union Square (Macy's) which was a nice view. I ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was ok but fairly noisy, and I ordered room service which was prompt and pricey. I overheard one of the staff explaining that a custom wood staircase will be a main feature of the new lobby- sounds wonderful, I'll have to see it when I return!",9-Oct-12,4
Stayed for 5 nights in September. As already mentioned Lobby is still having work done to it. However staff have worked hard to minamise any inconvienience. Stayed in a club room on 33rd floor. Expensive (as San Francisco is) but very pleased with the room and view fantastic. Breakfast in Club lounge was more than adequate for my husband and I as we are not bothered about having a full cooked breakfast every morning. This is normal in our experience of club rooms for breakfast so was not suprised. What did suprise me was that you had to pay for the alcoholic drinks .Yes they were discounted but I have never had to pay for alcohol before in any club room we have been in. Usually 2-3hours of free drinks and then stop. Location of Hotel is very good. Found all the staff very professional and helpful. Would recommend the hotel but shop around for the best deals on all similar hotels,8-Oct-12,4
"Lobby is still very minimal while being remodeled, but no visible construction or detraction that I could notice as a guest. Stayed on the 12th floor and was not disturbed by noise. The room is wonderful, I loved the room darkening shade that could be lowered or raised from the bed. Bathroom fixtures and amenities are grand. Wi-Fi was free and strong. The location is wonderful. I did not eat at the hotel, I was at a conference where most meals were covered.",6-Oct-12,5
"Hotel has a fantastic location, just off Union Square. There is a Starbucks across the street and a 7-11 about 3 minutes away. Got a club room on a high floor with a spectacular view of Alcatraz! Food at the Club floor was quite spartan for the price we paid (about US$700 /night). I opted for the pricier Club floor room due to a recent stupendous experience at their Hong Kong hotel. Two options of hot food, cereals, hot cocoa/coffee/tea, pastries, fruits. You couldn't even order pancakes or bacon.. a major disappointment for the kids. We ended up buying our own nutella and peanut butter and bringing that every morning for breakfast. Cocktails was another surprise as you have to pay per glass of wine ordered! The level of service and food / wine option are leagues apart from the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong. HK offers unlimited champagne (Moet!) and wines at no extra cost and a massive spread of food! Loads of people at the check-in / check-out counters as hotel is a popular choice for conventions. Definitely check-in / check-out online. It will save you time and the headache of waiting. Concierge was polite and helped us book a couple of tours: Alcatraz (book in advance, especially during peak seasons) & Redwood, amongst others. We stayed almost 10 nights in this property. Next time, we will try a different hotel.",5-Oct-12,3
"My family and I stayed for 8 nights and it is without doubt one of the best hotels my family and I have stayed at. The staff on the front desk were fantastic, often going out of their way to meet our request, housekeeper was faultless (couldnt fault a thing), the views from our room were sensational and the Grand Club is a must. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Sensation value for money when you include the views and grand club facilitys which came in very handy with our kids using the free internet there as well as haling ourselves to the juices, bottles of water, yoghurts etc.",4-Oct-12,5
"Though disappointed that construction was not completed as indicated on their website, the location more than made up for it. We had a nice room, facing Union Square, on a high floor. Looks like the rooms were recently redone, but seemed small and had NO drawers to put clothing away. The in room frig was appreciated. Be sure to up to the 36th floor for drinks or a meal. The view is spectacular.",4-Oct-12,4
stayed here for a night as I had a summit the Hyatt regency and they wre booked out the 1st night so I was directed here.good size room and the food was.the best is the breakfast at club level that has ana amazing view of the city.I only stayed a night so I didnt get to experience all the amenities but overall I would recomend this hotel especially if it was a choice between this and the hyatt regency.,1-Oct-12,4
We just checked out today after three nights in a newly renovated room on the 20th floor. The room was quite comfortable and well thought out. It was equipped with a mini refrigerator and had a view overlooking Union Square. Floor to ceiling blackout shades are very helpful during the afternoon to block out the direct sun. Because the hotel is in the process of renovation (the last phase will be the relocation of the signature restaurant on the 36th floor and its conversion into function rooms) the staff and management are especially helpful and apologetic and concerned about keeping guest informed as to what is happening.The location is very convenient to the Muni and other public transportation as well as shopping and other tourist oriented activities.,1-Oct-12,4
"Rooms were on the smaller side, standard, nothing spectacular...Not one with a view either! It was very loud, between construction and the wind, we weren't able to sleep very much..Best part about this hotel was the location, near lots of shops, restaurants and bars. Short walk To China town, northbeach and Embarcadero. Cable car stops also nearby.. we had breakfast up on the restaurant, view was great but food was average and super over priced..overall a little disappointed with the stay, not a four star experience for sure.. ",1-Oct-12,3
"Stayed here for 10 days in September. Although lobby under construction this did not effect our stay. Rooms lovely all refurbished, very quiet we were in the 18th floor great view. Hotel bar great with good views of the city. Fantastic location right in union sq could not ask for more. Would def stay here again. ",1-Oct-12,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for six days during the Intel IDF conference in September 2012. The location of the hotel is a block away from Union Square, and it's a short walk to the nearest subway/BART station. I had a standard room in the 32st floor with a king bed. The room was newly renovated, and during my stay they were also working on renovating the lobby of the hotel, I did however not notice that too much. As mentioned the newly renovated rooms were quite good in size, and so was the bathroom, everything also seemed very clean.For breakfast, I used the Grand Club in the 32nd floor, which is open for people in club rooms, and GP Diamond members, the Club at Grand Hyatt SF is open 24 hours, so you can also pick up water/soft drinks at night. The view from the club is excellent!Overall my stay was very good, the staff at the hotel was very friendly, and I would definitely come back next time I visit San Francisco, either on business or with my family.",30-Sep-12,4
"This was mine and my husbands' first trip to San Francisco. What an amazing place. We stayed on the 31st floor and had an amazing view of the city. This hotel is right in the middle of all the shops. It is about a 2 minute walk down to the start of the cable cars - which cost $6 per person per ride (you can get day passes). The hotel is right at Union square - where there is an information center with all the things to do.We ate at a fantastic restaurant right around the corner from the hotel called Scala's - dinner.Eat at the Cheese Factory - again near the hotel for lunch.Things we did and you must do:Walk from Pier 15 all the way to Pier 29 where you can watch the seals on the docks. Go to Fishermans Wharf - lots of restaurants.Rent a car or bike and go across Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. Very pretty.Visit the Painted Ladies - famous houses in a row.Walk down the crookest street - Lombard Street.We would stay in this hotel again - very central, great staff, great views.",29-Sep-12,5
"My husband, kids, parents and I spent 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt in SF last August. The location of this hotel is great if you would like to stay downtown. It is right at Union Square, close to shops and tour stops. We had two adjoining rooms on the 15th floor. The view from both rooms was amazing. The rooms were recently remodeled. One of the rooms had a vanity right outside the bathroom which I thought was very useful. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom, although a bit small, was functional and nice looking. The lobby was still under construction, so it got crowded at times but since we were not spending time in the lobby, this did not bother us that much. On the last night at the hotel, we had dinner at the rooftop restaurant which supposedly has one of the best view in SF. I say ""supposedly"" because we did not get to see anything since the fog had settled in. Overall, a great stay at the Grand Hyatt and I would definitely stay there again.",28-Sep-12,4
"First vist to SF, the hotel is in a great location for all transport around the city, Muni F takes you between pier 39 and fishermans wharf to south of market, renovation of the hotel not quiet finished, but will be great when it's done, the rooms are a good size and very modern, with everything that you need, hotel staff are friendly and has free airline check in which was useful, thanks for a great holiday!",28-Sep-12,4
"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco for 7 nights. The hotel is great and I have mostly all positive things to say about my stay. The room I had, in particular, was fabulous. It was a huge room on the 31st floor that overlooked the financial district. The room was modern with hardwood floors, large windows with automatic blinds, great furniture, a nice bathroom with a HUGE walk-in shower and, of course the Hyatt bed which is large and comfortable. Outside the room, the gym was very nice, as was the Club Lounge and the hotel is very close to Union Square and all of the San Francisco sites. The staff for the most part was all very nice and helpful...it didn't seem like they would go out of their way to be friendly and helpful, but if engaged it was fine.Now, there was a couple things that that kept me from rating the hotel a ""5"". First, is the reception area. I understand the lobby is under construction and that's fine. However, the check-in procedure (which appears to be fully renovated) is very confusing for a hotel this size. There are several small desks for check-in and the lines get quite long and people get angry quickly. My second criticism would be the restaurant, or more specifically, the lounge on the 36th floor. I am assuming it is next on the renovations list because it is quite outdated and rather old appearing. The menu in the lounge as well is quite small and very basic food. I ate there 2 nights - not wanting to go to the restaurant - it was fine, just had a diminished expectation from the feeling from the rest of the hotel.Overall, I would quickly recommend the Grand Hyatt to anyone. I was sad to check-out and move into my new apartment in San Francisco.",28-Sep-12,4
"Stayed at the hotel for a week from the 19th September. Was in a great location, the room was big and the beds were lovely and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpfull. The fridge in the room was good for keeping water and milk in. There was a water machine and a ice machine on all the floors. The lobby is still being done up, will be finished in November, but didnt make any difference to our stay. The bar on the 36th floor was great, but its going to be changed into a conference room and the bar will be relocated. Rooms were cleaned and beds made everyday with clean towels. Would definately go back",28-Sep-12,4
"I stayed here recently with some girlfriends. The location is perfect, right on Union Square, the rooms are very comfortable and clean and the fridge is very useful. The only thing missing is an ipod dock which is standard in most good hotels. The hotel charges for wifi which is unnecessary and annoying !  The staff are all friendly and helpful.",27-Sep-12,3
My friend and i have just returned after staying a week at the Hyatt and this hotel was in a great location.We had a room on the 12th floor and found only the same levels of noise coming from outside that you would find in any city so really wasnt that bad.We had a room with 2 double beds which were sooooo comfortable after a long day out sight seeing.Yes the lobby is not completed yet but that did not bother us and all the staff were very polite and very helpfull especially the consierge team.The 36th floor bar was great with amazing views and was very busy at times it is such a shame that they are moving the bar to the 2nd floor im sure the powers at be know what they are doing never the less agreat shame.Union square is a great location for getting out and about we took the cable car one block away on powell street this is also where the station is for the bart train from the airport $8.75 one way or $16 for shuttle express arranged by the hotel which was very efficient.All in all this hotel is great value and im sure if the lobby means alot to some folk it will be great when completed in nov.Would i stay again most deffinately.,27-Sep-12,5
Excellent and safe location - 1 minute walking distance from Union Square. Very clean and new renovated room.Wireless internet should be free- no slippers in the room and no shower cap! For a 4 star hotel these are must.,27-Sep-12,5
We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Grand Hyatt. It was a girls weekend away and it was awesome. The beds and pillows were comfy and the bathroom super clean ! The staff was very helpful and we had no real problems. Would definitely stay again.,26-Sep-12,5
"Even though the Hotel was under renovation the hotel staff made up for any inconvenience. We booked a King room and when we arrived they had us for a Twin room. We showed the front desk person our copy of our on-line purchase and with out making any excuses they gave us our King bed room and free breakfast at the club room for all three days we were there. By the way the club room rocks, a great view on the 32 floor which we were staying on made it even more convenient. The Club room besides having better the your average continental breakfast serves up appetizers, wine and beer from 5:30 - 7:30PM every night. Oh by the way it's honor bar at night, which of course we did pay for. The location is great, situated next to Union Square and all the great shops.",26-Sep-12,5
"Some hotels don't quite have it right with the new minimalistic renovations they have undertaken. The Grand Hyatt San Francisco got it right. I stayed in a small suite, so this review may be slightly different from some other others but I could not have been more pleased.When you enter the room there is a light panel where you can indicate lights on, off, low or shades open or closed. A panel further into the room says ""Welcome and Goodbye"" to adjust the lights to predetermined levels. There is a lots of unique lighting throughout the space.The room has hardwood floors, and gray walls, with subtle bursts of color in the area rugs and a picture on the wall. Lots of wood detailing also. In the parlor area there is a desk with a large screen MAC computer, on which I am writing this review, and a 50-52"" Bose plasma connected to a blu-ray player. The room comes stocked with about a dozen various dvds for your entertainment. The Bose plasma is also has an iPod dock, so you can control your iPod through the remote for the plasma and watch your movies or videos on a big screen.Helpful to the business traveler, there are outlets literally everywhere. Near the bed, on top of the work desk in the bathroom and pretty much everywhere you need one. Nice sized walk in closet. Three very large floor to ceiling windows with automatic shades controlled from several places throughout the room.Bathroom is large and includes a separate tub and seated area along with the shower inside of the same walled area. Includes a rain type shower head in the ceiling, along with optional handheld shower heads on the wall and another for use in the bathtub.The bed was comfortable; I feel like Hyatt opted for something more comfortable in their renovation than they've had in the past. This is room I definitely wanted to come ""home"" to at the end of my busy days.Fitness center is not large but has modern LifeFitness equipment. About 6 treadmills, 5 or so ellipticals, a few bikes, and weight machines.The front door area is under construction, but this didn't cause any problems with my stay. The concierge and front desk staffs are top notch when it comes to customer service. I was on a top floor and did still hear street noise at time, but am not a light sleeper and it didn't cause any problem for me.",26-Sep-12,5
"This the second time I stayed here & it's been a very pleasent experience again, so I thought to write a Good review on them! Location is Fantastic, just around the corner of Union Sq!Very Comfortable Newly rennovated rooms & great services! At the moment they're rennovating the Lounge area, as they're very organize so nothing really gets in the way. I'll be back. Oh WIFI is excellent!",25-Sep-12,5
"Pros:* Elegant room and bathroom design. * Attractive offers because of renovation.* The WiFi was free to my surprise (perhaps also because of the renovation).* Location right around the corner from Union Square.Cons:* Noisy rooms - windows are old and don't close properly. What's even worse is that the aircon/heater cannot be switched off and is always blowing.* My ""City view"" room on the 21st floor had a vastly different view from the 36th floor, so insist on a high floor.* Breakfast buffet ($23) is rather limited for a hotel of this size and class (a Hilton Garden Inn has more variety).* No place to hang towels in bathroom.* Towels so fluffy one is covered in a layer of white fluff after showering...",25-Sep-12,4
"The Hotel is lovely, rooms comfortable, there is free wifi if you only want to email and catch up on social media. Starbucks across the road, Self Service laundry 3min walk on Bush St. One block to trolley (Powell St) to Fisherman's Wharf. My only disappointment and maybe it is due to current renovations, was it was not clear how to check in, people standing all over the place, nowhere to queue, I ended up using self service kiosk beause I couldn't get assistance from anyone. I had to find someone to ask where lifts were, not helful at all! I was disappointed we were given 2 Dbl beds instead of the King I requested 4 months earlier as it was our 25th wedding anniversary...how romantic! I didn't bother to complain as we were able to check in early at midday which was a bonus. The restaurant / bar on 36th floor is great with wonderful views of the city and bay, great place to pass time when waiting for airport shuttle! Overall a great stay.",25-Sep-12,4
"My daughter and I shared a mini vacay in August and stayed at this hotel. We loved the hotel and our room was very shi shi . Other than the construction in the lobby we found all the staff we spoke to to be very friendly and helpful. The location was central to everything. Just a short walk to famous, Chinatown. Very easy to get around the city at this location and the concierge was extremely helpful in recommending restaurants and patient with directions. The restaurant at the top had some breathtaking views once the fog blew over. Comfortable beds and a quiet floor made this stay most enjoyable.",25-Sep-12,5
"My wife and I stayed here in September. It is a very nice hotel right on union square. The rooms are modern and very clean. There is a nice top floor restaurant and bar overlooking the city. The staff were lovely and helpful. The cable car is a short stroll away which u can ride down to Fisherman warf. My only complaint was the wait for breakfast on Sunday morning, otherwise a great stay.",24-Sep-12,4
We knew that the lobby of the hotel was undergoing a reno and it was not a problem. Our room was as requested with 2 double beds; rooms were also recently renovated and were well laid out and appointed. My only real complaint was with the sliding door to the bathroom - feels like the door is not quite closed and lacked some privacy. The bed was wonderful and gave a great sleep. We also enjoyed the Grandviews Lounge - we shared a Caesar salad and the pizza - plenty for 2 people. The staff at the concierge desk were very helpful and knowlegeable. the location was great; close to all the great shops and Union Square. Only other complaint was that it was pricey and yet local calls were $1 each (!!) and the internet was $15/day.,24-Sep-12,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on two occasions in September and both were great experiences. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to rooms on the 31st and 32nd floors for our stays. The location worked great for us, fairly centrally located and easy to get where we wanted. We did however, hear street noise all the way up as the full outside wall is window. Gave a great view of the city though! And it was fun listening to the USC pep rally in Union Square. Rooms were completely renovated and very nice with room darkening shade a the touch of a button. Enjoyed the Grandviews Lounge and Restaurant while we were there also. Bar staff were very friendly.",24-Sep-12,5
Up-to-date hotel with great rooms. I was on the 30th floor and had a spectacular view of the Macy's and the city. The bar on the 36th level was also affordable and gave us a great view of the Bay. It even had live music on Thursday night. I stayed there for 4 nights and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something central in San Francisco. You can't really beat the location of this Union Square hotel. The light and curtain switchs next to the beds was for sure appreciated and the bathroom offers a big sink. Everything was great.,24-Sep-12,5
"Our two night stay at the Grand Hyatt was at the tail end of a two week family vacation in Nevada and California. We have stayed in Hyatt hotels in the past (in fact, this was our third Hyatt property on this vacation) and it was truly amazing. Very well located, very modern, well staffed (and friendly). Our room faced the bay, and we were about 2/3 of the way up the tower, so THAT was a pleasant surprise. The room was big enough for all four of us (two adults and two pre-teens).Only complaint (and it's a minor one) - based on the price that we paid for this hotel, would it kill them to offer complimentary wireless internet access? (One of the other two Hyatt's that we stayed at on this trip also wanted payment for wireless). That aside, we'd stay there again in a heartbeat.",24-Sep-12,5
"We visited San Francisco for 1 week in September. The hotel is just newly renovated and in the lobby there is still some wok going on but didn't effect us at all. We got a room upgrade to the 20th floor with a view over Union Square which was great. Rooms always clean, concierge was extremely helpful and stunning view from the bar on the 36th floor. The weather was nice, around 20-24 degrees but can get cold at night due to breeze. ",24-Sep-12,5
"Grand hotel, with central location, good service, renovated rooms, clean but why oh why did they not renovate the windows...noise is awful and for the price and brand, this is not acceptable.Pros: great location right near union Sq but not on the cable car roads. Stunning views from the restaurant. Good service overall (top marks for their conceirge).Rooms are nicely appointed and good sized bathroooms. Clean overall (lobby was being renovated so cannot comment on what it will end up as, but they dealt OK with that)Con's: check in does not match the ticket. Book a room get another lottery seems to be the order of the day. Checkin staff smile away but don't seem to care, no doubt heard it all before...Worst part is the noise. Now we were up on or near 25th floor, so I hate to think what it was like down below. The windows are single glazed so you could hear pretty much everything happening below. Why do you renovate a place and forget to put in some serious sound proofing ont he windows??reason is perhaps what lets this hotel down the most. They've got a great brand, a great location and want to milk this for kingdom come.Get that sorted out, and this would be a good but expensive 4 star.PS Complaining gets you extra points and smiles but they clearly messed up on the noise",24-Sep-12,3
"We were in San Francisco for the start of a 17 day trip around the southwest to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and our travel agent selected this as our first hotel. Right on Union Square near the shopping district and a short walk to the historic cable cars makes this a great location. The view from the restaurant is second to none, being on the 36th floor with panoramic views over most of San Francisco's landmarks, when not covered in mist. The Hyatt is still undergoing some refurbishment, which gave a somewhat cluttered appearance on entry to the lobby. But the staff were very friendly and welcoming.The rooms however were of excellent decor and modern, complete with a separate bathroom and dressing area and included a large screen LCD TV and an i-pod dock!The only reason this gets a four is because that in this day and age you should not have to pay extra for wi-fi when you are paying this amount of money to stay. We stayed at 9 different hotels on this trip and this was the only one which actually charged for wi-fi, poor, considering some of the others were more budget end of the hotel market.Wi-fi charges aside, if you want a hotel with good location and stunning views this is the place come.",24-Sep-12,4
"This hotel is well located in union square with all local amenities on its doorstep. Our room over looked union sq and Macy's. The room was big with a very comfy bed and decent bathroom. The staff have been fantastic, very welcoming. Breakfast is great, a good selection which gets you started for the day. The highlight of the hotel has to be the bar and restaurant on the 36th floor. Incredibly views of San Fran including coit tower, Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. Highly recommend this hotel.",23-Sep-12,4
"We stayed in a bay view room on level 28, and while the room was nice enough, the view was what made it memorable. We thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic view of the bay, Alcatraz, Coit Tower and the TransAmerica building. As the hotel is currently undergoing renovation of its lobby, we got a stay 2 nights, get the third free including breakfast so it was excellent value (with exception of the wifi at $10/ day). The union square location was very central, with a short walk to china town and north beach. ",23-Sep-12,4
"We stayed here for the last part of our honeymoon and with the exception of the construction and concierge I would give it 4 stars.Pros: Upgraded to a suite and wine and cheese sent to our room. Phenomenal touch and the front desk staff was amazing. The room was spacious, modern and absolutely gorgeous.Cons: The concierge experience. Rude Rude Rude. Not friendly, professionally or educated about the city. The concierge had us waiting for 30 minutes to ask a question and when we got to the front desk he actually complained about a prior customer staying at the hotel. I've travelled to many first class hotels and I have never heard a hotel staff speak to another hotel guest about another guest that way. It was appalling.",22-Sep-12,4
We selected this hotel as the options in San Fran are quite limited.. and we were able to book at great rate! We really enjoyed our stay even though the lobby and reception is under serious construction. Rooms have all been renovated and are very comfy - nicely decorated and if you have view - it is a killer view! Bar on the top floor had amazing views but felt like a tourist trap - hope this is one the renovation list as well! What you can see of the lobby so far - looks really promising - stylish - hip and perfect for the city. Location for shopping can not get any better - it is ALL right there - All of it! So this was great for us (bad for our wallets). We did not have any meals here - but why would you in a city like San Fran with all its amazing options. The concierge (Gentleman and lady) were both really helpful and friendly. We will be very happy to stay here again.. and no it was not our most amazing hotel experience ever - but perhaps one of the most convenient city hotel experiences. - I really do not have any critique here (except maybe the construction - but then again they are just getting it ready for our next stay).,22-Sep-12,4
"We started our recent travels in the Grand Hyatt. The hotel is under going renovations of its reception area however all of the room have been restyled. Our room was on the 17th floor and we had a good view of the city and could see the water between the buildings.The room was a good size and clean and there was everything that you required within the room. However ladies if you go to use the hairdryer you may have a problem as the lead to the hairdryer is so short I was unable to blow dry my hair, this was not a problem as I had brougth my own. We had a meal in the restaurant located on the top floor of the hotel which gave us a spectactular view over the city to the bay. The food was good and service was also good.The hotel is located by Union Square which is a good location for transport and to get to all area's of the city.",22-Sep-12,4
"Stayed for a conference;spacious rooms recently updated and are very well done. Nicely furnished; comfortable bed, widescreen TV, great bathroom - except for sink - very shallow and prone to prone to spilling water if glass is emptyed quickly. Hotel dining and lounge are on the top floor, very good quality food and service; excellent views. Fitness facility is also top notch. The hotel lobby is still under construction so services are somewhat cramped for now - due to be completed by year end; enter from the side next to Levi's store. Overlooking the square and in the heart of everything, this is a great location from which to enjoy all that San Francisco offers.",21-Sep-12,4
My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt S.F. last week. We were lucky or because we are regular guests we were given a Bay View room on the 31st floor. It was beautiful. The Hyatt lobby is in the process of being totally remodeled and should be finished in October or November. This is the last step in the hotel being remodeled from top to bottom. The staff went overboard to make everyone feel comfortable thru the check in. Only complaint is you can hear guests outside your door talking especially when they slam their door at 2am. Still a very nice hotel in a great location,19-Sep-12,5
"This hotel was good, but not what I was expecting. The location is a big plus. You can't beat it. Around the corner from Union Square. The room was nice, but the bed and pillows were terrible. Very uncomfortable. The bathroom and shower were good though. However, the biggest disappointment for me had to be the Grand Club facilities. The breakfast choices on offer were poor and the fact that alcohol during the evening ""happy hour"" service had to be paid for was amateurish. I've previously paid for the same type of benefits when I stayed at the Sofitel in Melbourne Australia and their offering was a lot better. The breakfast was better quality and all drinks and food was free to club guests between 5pm and 7pm each night. Charging people for drinks when they've already paid extra to use the club facilities is a disgrace.",19-Sep-12,3
"The location for this property is excellent for exploring the best areas of San Francisco. This is a far better area to stay compared to touristy Fisherman's Wharf. The rooms here are clean, comfortable, and modern. The couple of times that I've stayed here, we had a great view of the city. Higher floors are better obviously.",17-Sep-12,4
"We stayed here for 3nights, the room was great-had everything we needed And housekeeping did a great job. The best thing about this hotel is the location-right by union square and the top floor bar and restaurant has the most amazing views but isn't ridiculously over priced. I would recommend this hotel to anyone",16-Sep-12,5
"New refurbished rooms are simply ok. Nice and clean at the minute but poor quality and will not last, some bits falling apart already. Refurbishment also only partial. Still noisy air-con and old doors that should have been replaced. Noise from corridors can be easily heard in rooms. Sprinklers not cleaned and dusty. Refurbishments of the lobby were continuing despite booking confirmation stating they would be finished.Staff all very friendly.Location pretty good although be aware of where you are walking at night.Parking $56 a night. Suggest using the Union Square underground car park where the Hyatt actually park the valet cars. Will save $20 a night and is just next door. Do not use the multi story car park diagonally opposite, cars often get stolen.Pretty average.",14-Sep-12,3
"Hotel is in a prefect location for visiting SF and the rooms are attractive, clean and with stunning views. Customer service is terrible though, we had quite a large problem during our stay which was not resolved at all by the staff, in fact they only made it worse! Complained to Hyatt head office on my return home and received compensation and an apology. Despite this I would stay again as the hotel was nice and the location great, unjust wouldn't expect anything from a customer service point of view! Ask for a high floor room on the bay side for an amazing view. ",14-Sep-12,4
"I stayed there in late July early august and had a wonderful experience. The location was great, and we had a beautiful view of the city. Do yourself a favor, and have a drink at the bar. The prices are comparable to any city bar and you get a great view of the city. We were originally supposed to stay in a hotel in Berkeley and I am so happy we splurged on this. It was worth every penny. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",13-Sep-12,5
"My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights at the end of a little west coast road trip we were doing. The location is great, right near union square downtown. Easily within walking distance to great shops, restaurants, cable car stops, and other attractions. They were finishing some renovations in the lobby but it really wasn't anything that was an in inconvenience. The room we got had just been renovated and everything was really modern. It was big, had floor to ceiling window, updated bathroom, big comfy king sized bed, and was 'pure' so had hypoallergenic linens and an air purifier in the room-pretty cool. Only complaint was that we were in an adjoining room and when someone checked into the room next to us they were pretty noisy and we could hear them through the wall. Overall loved our stay and wound definitely go back.",11-Sep-12,5
Thought for the most part the room was good. Comfy bed and housekeeping was good too. Wish we had a room higher then level 15 so we didn't hear the door man call for taxis. The place in under construction but I would say the people were nicer as we were checking out than when we checked in...Unless I get a great deal would I go back but I'm sure I could find just as nice of a place for cheaper.,10-Sep-12,3
"Large, stylish and recently refurbished rooms including walk through wardrobe, attentive service and an unbeatable location in union square make this a great place to stay. Some minor criticisms - the walls are very thin, so you can hear everything going on in the rooms around you and every time someone opens their door, it sounds like they are coming into your room; the water pressure in the shower is pathetic; the amenities were pretty basic - no shower cap, sewing kit etc and the bath towels were too small. The lobby is undergoing renovation so it is cramped and the layout confusing. Apart from that, highly recommended. ",9-Sep-12,5
"We were a little disappointed with this hotel, given the price and reputation. It was a good stay, but we expected better.The lobby was dark, drab and outdated, and the staff weren't particularly friendly.That said, the rooms and hallways are very nice, very stylishly decorated too. The room was spacious and bright, the bed was fairly comfortable, and the bathroom was nice and clean.The hotel is in a FANTASTIC location. Right beside Union Square, a minute away from the cable car, a load of bus routes, and a few minutes from the bart/muni station.My biggest complaint was noise. This is not a quiet hotel by any means. There is a huge amount of noise from the street outside, partly from the roadworks, but mostly from people and traffic. There's also a lot of noise from within the hotel. We heard people talking in the neighbouring rooms and the hallways. We also heard the housekeeping staff hoovering right outside our door every second morning at 8:30am. Lovely wake up call...All in all, this wasn't a bad stay, but I was expecting a bit more. Would I recommend this hotel to others? Probably, but only with the caveats of ""If you can get a discount"" and ""bring earplugs""",9-Sep-12,3
Reccomended by our travel agent.A great location just off Union Square.Lobby was dark and a bit uninviting but the staff very friendly and helpful.The room was very clean and modern with very very comfortable beds!!!I would definately come back.,8-Sep-12,4
"Lots of nice things about the hotel - great location, beautiful views from top floors and just a few blocks from BART. Unfortunately, the lobby is currently under construction. It's quite a mess right now. I would stay here again for the right price, though there are so many great hotels in San Francisco that I tend to move around.",8-Sep-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt is situated a few steps from San Francisco' Union Square where you will find absolutely everything you need;shops, restaurants (pricey though), tram and bus tour stops, etc. Me and my husband stayed on a high floor room and just coudn't get enough of the view.The 36th floor, where the restaurant and bar are located also has an amazing skyline views (best at night time)! The beds are extraordinary and so are the pillows, you only realise this when you go to another hotel straight after this one and think how comfortable the Hyaat was. The bathroom is quite big with a great shower. All amenities in the room are up to a 5* standard!The service is ok, shame about some of the staff who could not understand English that well, but we managed to order some room service at the end. Overall, a very nice hotel and I highly recommend it.",7-Sep-12,4
"Very rarely will you stay at a hotel where you can have a once in a lifetime view. From the 36th floor bar looking north you can see across the bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, the city, the Pacific Ocean and into the horizon. If you can, stay on a high floor with a room facing north. Aside from the sublime views from the high floors, the rest of the hotel is perfectly fine. My room was small, modern, recently renovated, and attractive. The staff was helpful and friendly. The hotel lobby is under renovation, thus there is no place to hang there. The internet is not free, but upon check in the staff provided me with complimentary access. The health club was modern and had great east facing views from the 3th floor. Stay here if you want to be near Union Square and the central business and shopping districts.",7-Sep-12,5
"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for 3 nights over a very busy weekend- the city was sold out! My expectations are generally not high when it comes to chain hotels but the Grand Hyatt was overall a very pleasant expereince. In fairnesss, the hotel is completeing rennovations so the lobby area is small right now, and a little chaotic. The rooms however have been renovated and are wonderful- great contemporary design, light & bright (higher rooms have good views) and very pleasant bathrooms. The service in the hotel won't win any awards but equally was pleasant and the staff were always helpful even when it was clear they were very busy! The location of the hotel on Union Square doesn't come any better. What does come a lot better is the food- just not at the Grand Hyatt. Rooftop retaurant/ bar was horrible and the service was well...... non-existant. We left after 30 minutes of no action! However there are great places to feed and water yourself within a 10 minute walk of the hotel so go explore!",5-Sep-12,4
"We stayed in June of this year, first time in San Francisco. Debated over the Fishermans Wharf area or downtown. Opted for downtown and the Grand Hyatt as I'm a Hyatt Platinum card holder. Room was ok, not particularly large, but it was just a standard room. Maybe this is the norm for San Fran, but I just though small and the whole hotel just lacked any atmosphere and life.",5-Sep-12,3
Nice new room with north bay view from 27th floor. Bed etc so comfy! Lobby under construction. Service very nice. All good! Parking available on Stockton St behind hotel. Breakfast included on a bed& breakfast package deal-good! Dinner not recommended. Bar view from 36th floor- wow!,4-Sep-12,5
"Trying to choose the right hotel adds so much stress to a trip, especially a spur-of-the-moment one. I found myself a bit overwhelmed with the variety of hotels available in the San Francisco area and after several hours of reading reviews and looking through guest photos I opted on the Hyatt Grand. The rooms at the Hyatt were recently renovated and the lobby is still under renovation. The check-in was easy, the room was very clean, the view was great and later that night we discovered the matteress was perfect. To be honest it was almost like we were the only ones in the hotel, no noise, no maids running up and down the hallways and no elevators doors opening and closing. I soon found my room a welcome spot to shower and rejuventate after our miles of walking.",4-Sep-12,5
The room i stayed in had a great view of union square. There are lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance to the hotel. Room was clean and staff was helpful. The lobby was still being renovated right now but the room was comfortable and clean.,4-Sep-12,4
"...We didn't have handicap room. When I talked to the lady over the phone, I was informed there will be a small bed for my daughter,6y.o, which wasn't the case. Not only that, we checked in at 5pm and they had no room but the handicap room for us. We couldn't find the light switch, I am not sure if all the rooms were like that. The view was nice but I am not used to these types of rooms to be honest. I just didn't like the room, I was expecting to have a better room.The tv wasn't that clear. That is odd, we are in SF people.There was construction in the reception area, don't be discouraged to stay in this hotel because of the constructions. Everything is running just smooth, a lot of staff in the main entrance to help...Really good location at the square, lots of shopping and great restaurants around.We tried the hotel restaurant on the 36th floor. Really nice breakfast and decent service, not too busy which is good for me.I have mixed feelings to be honest. I am not sure if I want to stay here again. I didn't make a complaint because the gentleman did apologize when checked in and told me that was th last room... So I wasn't willing to lose my money because of their refund and cancellation policy... Also I didn't want to call other hotels around because I wasn't sure what to expect anymoreI am just confused.",3-Sep-12,3
"Right beside union square with all of the shops including high end stores and a nearby shopping mall. This was my first trip to San Francisco and this was a perfect location because all of the restaurants, sightseeing and shopping were right near the hotel. Literally walking distance which was so great. We stayed on one of the club floors which are clean, looked recently renovated (nice bathrooms). The rooms are smaller than I expected for the club floor but we didn't spend too much time there anyways and that's the only sort of negative comment I have about the room. The room was always clean and tidy by the time we came back to our room which was great. We had access to the club lounge which had spectacular views and really good finger foods and free drinks. The service there was impeccable as well. We enjoyed some lunches on the 36th floor in the Grandview restaurant and again can't say enough about the views. Definitely sit in the bar area for better views of the bay. The front lobby was a bit cramped and dark due to the renovations but I'll let that slide because we enjoyed our stay and would come again.",3-Sep-12,4
"This hotel is very well located, very close to the Union Square, Macy's, Nike, and some fancy stores like Prada, Burberry, Louis Vitton etc. I chosen a Club Floor Room that provide me breakfast and snacks. The food and service is very good and I slept very well. I recommend!",3-Sep-12,4
"Despite the more recent reviews, we found our room to be clean and comfortable. With floor-to-ceiling windows, there is plenty of light in the room (we had a bay view, with full views of San Francisco Bay and Alcatraz). The rooms are small, but this isn't Kansas.We did not eat at the Hyatt restaurant (Grandviews on 36th floor), but heard it was good.Pluses:1. Starbucks directly across the street.2. All the shops around Union Square at your back door (Nordstrom, Prada, Zara, Louis Vitton, Levi's, Macy's, Bloomingdales, etc.).3. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.4. Leave the front door, turn left (Sutter), and at the next corner (Powell), you can take the purple cable car (Powell-Hyde) all the way to Ghiradelli Square for $6. Walk along the shoreline to Fort Mason (next door) and have lunch at Greens (vegetarian fare).5. San Francisco Chronicle is put out by the elevators in the mornings for you to take.Minuses:1. Room was noisy on Saturday night, but quiet on weeknights.2. Bar (also on the 36th floor) was always crowded, so we went elsewhere.",2-Sep-12,4
"and looks bad.The rooms are small, depressing and ugly. The service is unfriendly. I just couldnt wait to leave the room as soon as I arrived.I still it competes very strongly with the New York Grand Hyatt for my worst Grand Hyatt experience.",1-Sep-12,2
"Nice place located in Union Square, breakfast at the top of the tower. Downstairs there is a a starbucks just across the road (Seems very important for USA people ;) ... 10 minutes by walk from the ferrymarket, 5 from the Chinatown and from Market street and Yerba Buone (where you can find a very nice foodcourt as well)",31-Aug-12,4
"Stayed here for a couple of nights in August: fabulous location, next to Union Square and not too hard of a walk from the Powell St. BART Station. Room was spacious enough and beds comfortable. Front desk very professional. Heard some street noise but don't think that can be avoided downtown. Had a band playing one night at Union Square and we could hear it from our room but it quieted down by the time we went to bed. Still doing some renovation but was barely noticeable. Booked a room that included breakfast for an additional $20 and boy, was it worth it. The buffet was excellent and I think I had the best french toast ever from their kitchen! Only thing is that I thought the internet was included and it wasn't but since I had an I-Phone, it was OK. Will clarify that detail next time. All in all, it was a great experience for us and I would highly recommend the Grand Hyatt.",31-Aug-12,5
"The hotel lobby is under renovation, but you really wouldn't notice it as the areas affected are fully blocked off. The hotel location simply cannot be beat. It is across the street from Starbucks and just a block away from Sears Fine Dining which is a good option for breakfast. A Trolley stop is 1 block away as is the main drag that takes you to Union Square and the Trolley turnaround. Amazing Union Square shopping is steps away from your front door. We stayed in a ""pure"" room, high floor, which was beautifully remodeled in a very clean, modern style and included an air purifier. Room size is smallish but I think that's what you can expect in a downtown setting and for 2 adults and 2 children it was just fine.",31-Aug-12,4
"Loved being in Union Square! This hotel is in walking distance to Chinatown, union square, cable cars...everything. Cabs are right out front, staff is helpful and friendly. Hotel is newer, nice rooms, very clean, nice view of city. Restaurant was good. Overall excellent experience and would absolutely stay at the Grand Hyatt again!",29-Aug-12,5
"I have stayed at this location many times while traveling for business in San Francisco. Great location in Union Square. Unbelievable views - on clear days - from the restaurant on the top floor. My favorite meal is their clam chowder with sourdough bread while over looking the city. They offer tasty peppermint salt water taffy at the front desk. Often when I check out I put some in my coat pocket, and when I find them weeks later it is a nice reminder of the hotel. I will be traveling into San Francisco for an overnight with my husband in late September, and we will be staying at the Grand Hyatt. I highly recommend it for business or leisure travel.",29-Aug-12,5
"The hotel is in the middle of a huge renovation. Because of this, the lobby is small and lots of parts are walled off due to construction. But the rooms have been redone, and they are quite nice. The bathroom is incredibly well lit. The rooms are a bit small, but to be expected for a place right off Union Sq. There is no gift shop or coffee bar in the hotel. YOu have to go across the street to the Starbucks. Parking is expensive, but again, you have to expect that for the location. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Location is great for shopping, site seeing, and dining. Lots of great restaurants w/in walking distance, including Chinatown. I would definitely consider staying here again, esp once they complete the reno.",27-Aug-12,4
"The hotel is very nice, excellently located in the most centered square of San Francisco, walking distance from chinatown and little Italy where night life is. Also it is in a very nice shopping area and with very useful bus stop close by. The only non-good thing is actually the smell. I don't know if it is due to the works in the entrance, but once entering there was always the smell of dogs.",27-Aug-12,5
"Spent three nights there recently. Very well located hotel, near all important locations in San Francisco. Service was excellent and everything at reasonable prices. Staff was especially helpful whenever a special need arose. All around outstanding experience at reasonable prices.",26-Aug-12,5
We booked through Expedia and booked a 'King bed and bay view' room. At check in we were given a double room. I produced my booking receipt and was told that I was getting a king room with a 'magnificent bay view'. The bay view turned out to be a glimpse of the bay past a few buildings with the other 95% being a view of the city. I complained and was told that it was both a bay view and city view room so I should be pleased with that. The view from the other side of the building gave a full panoroma of the bay.That was the bay view I believe that I paid for. The attitude was very disappointing. I specifically paid extra for a bay view and I was not given one. I am a member of the Hyatt 'gold passport' loyalty program and I will be cutting my card up. I also found the rooms very noisy (from other guests) and the breakfast very average.,26-Aug-12,2
"We stayed 3 nights at Club Level. Checking in easy. The Manager Christopher could not have been more helpful over a booking mix up. Room ideal with great view. Location great for the Bay, shopping, restaurants, public transport and AT&T Park! All the staff we dealt with (cleaners, concierge etc) were helpful and David in the Club was first rate. Ok so the lobby is nearly complete but It did not affect our stay!",24-Aug-12,5
"I recently spent four nights here for a conference. If I had the option, I would have given the hotel 4 1/2 stars. The property is in the heart of SF (not close to the water - you will need to take a trolley or cab unless you want a tough walk). The hotel is going through a pretty big renovation. The lobby area was pretty busy throughout the stay and always had a little wait for the main counter.I am a Hyatt Diamond member and used an upgrade certificate, so I got a two-room suite. The room was recently redone and very modern. Really enjoyed the comfort level. The Grand Club was really nice for breakfast and appetizers. The view from the Club are incredible - a similar view from the top bar/restaurant at the Hyatt. The pricing was pretty much what I expected for a Grand Hyatt in SF.",22-Aug-12,4
"This is a newly renovated hotel, (the lobby is still being worked on) At first glance the new rooms are very modern and slick looking, but then it gets funky. The window shades are electrically powered, good luck finding the switch. The wireless service is very very slooow. So we opted for the wired, the Ethernet cable is not on the desk where it would make sense, but next to the night stand, so you have to work from your bed. The door to the bathroom was a pocket door, which is cool looking but doesn't move fluidly. The toilet paper holder is back behind the toilet seat, but I think there is a good yoga move to twist and grab it. All said, the bed was great, the towels nice. The breakfast is expensive, and not worth the price unless someone else is paying for it.The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful considering the lobby is so small. The location is very convenient to Union Square.",22-Aug-12,4
Double rooms very small. Not worth the money. Parking $32 a night . This room costed us $270 after tax and parking. The base price was $206.I think they should tell you about the parking up front before booking the room.,22-Aug-12,4
"Great hotel right in the heart of the city. Perfect, modern room with great view. Staff was friendly and the concierge was very informative. As opposed to other reviews remodel was not a distraction and hardly noticeable. Will definitely stay again.",21-Aug-12,5
"After reading many reviews from tripadvisor, I decided to stay near Union square in San Francisco. As Grand Hyatt was newly renovated and have received quite a number of good reviews, I decided to give it a try.The taxi from airport to hotel took around 15 mins and cost USD 50 ( including tips). Hotel lobby / reception area was rather small and was crowded maybe due to the fact that one side was still under renovation. There were people and luggages everywhere. Check in was smooth but kind of cold. It was kind of mechanical without any smiles nor word of welcome.I have requested high floors as suggested by some tripadvisor members and was given a room on the 19th floor so noise disturbance from the streets was minimal.My room was newly renovated and had 2 twin beds and a flat screen tv. Although it is not extremely spacious, I did not find it too small or cramped. It can still fit 2 big suitcases if you do not keep them open at all times. Beds are soft and comfortable and the down pillow and quilt are also very comfortable.The bathroom has a large sink and hand held rain shower head . Unfortunately my shower pressure was a bit weak. There is tooth paste and hand soap but no shower cap. ( shower cap is important for me as I have long hair ) No slippers nor bathrobes.Â The room fridge is completely empty so you need to remember to get your water or drinks from nearby Walgreen Â . There is coffee maker in room but no glass coffee pot with it. I dont really bother with it as I prefer to order my coffee or have it outside. However, there is no room service menu and we had to ask for one from housekeeping. And when we made the order, we were told that quite a few things were not available as that was the old menu. Not a big deal, just minor annoyance.In room wifi works well but can only connect only up to 3 devices.Location is wonderful . There is a small convenient store 'Walgreen ' Â 3 mins walk away ( when you get out from the hotel, goÂ left then turn left again when you reach traffic lights. Small diner ' Loris' is opposite Walgreen which is good for a quick bite or breakfast. Starbucks is 2 mins away.You do not need a car in San Francisco city as everything is pretty close by. Taxis are not that expensive. But of course if you are going to napa valley or Carmel , then it will be better to have your own car.If you plan to do shopping, this hotel will be a great choice as there are many shops and a few large department stores all around. Saks, Â Macy's and Barney's are 2 minutes away and Nordstrom and Bloomingdales are 5 mins away.Â And you do not have to wait long for taxi in front of the hotel.If you want to buy a prepaid sim card, walk straight down stockton ( exit hotel turn right) then turn left on market street walk about 3-4 mins then you will see AT &T . The prepaid sim card starts at US$10 or $2 per day.Overall I am quite happy with this hotel and I would definitely stay here again if I could get a high floor room .",21-Aug-12,4
"Firstly the location was great as far as shopping was concerned for my wife and the staff were very helpful. We were on the 14th floor and would be very surprised if we were in one of the newly renovated rooms as ours really wasn't that fresh. My biggest issue with the room was the very thin walls that picked up a lot of noise even when our neighbours (and presumably us) were just doing standard things...talking, watching tv, leaving the room etc.Certainly wouldnt say that it's a bad hotel but would probably try one of the many other boutique hotels in the area as an alternative",20-Aug-12,3
"This hotel is perfectly located and was everything I could have asked for in regards to comfort, cleanliness, and service. Each and every member of the staff acknowledged us at all times, with most remembering our names. Check-in was quick and painless, and our club level room was spacious and afforded a lovely view. My review's title refers to the fact that I would HIGHLY recommend paying the upcharge for the club level, as it saves you from buying botteld water/soda from a store, and you can truly make breakfast and dinner a out of the food that is offered. It's not that we are cheap, but it's nice to have the option of just grabbing a couple small plates of food in the lounge after a long day of sightseeing. And the spread that is put out for breakfast is more than anybody would truly need- and I'm a breakfast person!The only thing that keeps this from a 5-star review is the fact that I could not get the room cold enough for my liking. I set the thermo to 65 (the lowest it could be set) and had the fan on constantly and it never really felt that cold.",20-Aug-12,4
"I stayed here in August 2012. There is currently construction / renovations of the building, expected to be completed near the end of the year. Overall the room was clean, mostly quiet and provided a good night sleep. There was some residual noise from the halls, kids staying on the floor were loud, but not enough to disturb me. Decent location in union square, lots of shopping, food and easy to get a taxi / tourist bus from the location. I would stay here again",20-Aug-12,3
"Great, centrally located hotel; it is very close to Union Square, cable car and Chinatown. Rooms were a bit small but nicely decorated. The concierge and other staff were very helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.",20-Aug-12,4
"Got club floor this time. Room feels much more spacious and view was excellent. Lounge has limited # of tables but selection was just good. Coffee serves throughout the day. Breakfast includes: Omulets, Oatmeal, Box of cereals, Strawberries, Bananas, Apples, Cantalope, Honeydew, Bagles, Toasts, Assorted Pastries & Muffins. Good selection of teas. Gas water, Perrier, Bottled Water, Cran Apple Juice, Apple Juice, Orange Juice, choice of milks, Sodas was available to take from the bottle. Grand Bed was super comfy, too.They are still doing lobby renovation and lobby has no place to sit. But service was good and fast, room is completely new and I like this hotel.",20-Aug-12,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt S.F. in late July for my husband's Birthday. We had a fantastic time. We flew into Oakland Airport, took the BART to the station 2 blocks away and just walked to the hotel. We had tickets for 2 days that we purchased online for the ""open top"" sightseeing bus that particularly takes you over the Golden Gate Bridge (as opposed to others that do not). Also make sure to buy tickets with the new company that has the newer buses (concierge was very helpful with this info). The station to pick up the tour buses is right in front of Union Square - a hop, skip and a jump away!We had a lovely dinner at the Embarcadero at the Epic RoastHouse (also recommended by our concierge because she knew we had our 5 year old son with us) - great suggestion! We had a limo driver bring us back to the hotel.Our room was on the 32nd floor and we had club lounge access - a must - an very convenient with a child to always have access to drinks and snacks. The breakfast was delicious every morning also - it included continental pastries, breads, cheeses, juices, yoghurts, fresh cut fruits, berries, smoked salmon as well as a hot meal (ie. vegetable omelettes etc...) each and every day. We were not around for the appetizer hour, so I cannot comment on that. The deserts at night were bite size gourmet tarts,cheesecake, cookies, etc..... The selection of Tazo teas and coffee drinks was great too! The service was great and the attendants in the lounge are extremely friendly. The computers and printer were very handy to print out boarding passes as well.The room was spectacular. I must say it was small, but what do you expect in Union Square? We had a corner room which had an amazing view of the Coit Tower, the City as well as the Coast!!! Stay on as high a floor as you can because even on the 32nd floor you can hear the traffic down below! Not an issue for me, but if you are a light sleeper - can be an issue. The room had an empty mini fridge, electric blinds, cool lighting, hardwood floors, updated bathroom with a raised sink. The bathroom does not have a bath tub, but a nice size walk in shower. The closet space and drawers are limited. There is a nice size safe for those who have many tablets, netbooks and treasures :)). They delivered a DVD machine for our son to watch his DVDs.The service was great. The lobby was still in the process of renovations, but that did not bother me at all because we never spend much time in lobbies. This hotel does not have a swimming pool.We just felt that the cleanliness, service and the location is unbeatable. We walked through China Town to the Fisherman's Wharf! Had a lovely ""loud"" child friendly and fun dinner at The Rainforest Cafe and walked back.The tour bus was also very handy to take us to many sights and museums like the California Academy of the Sciences - which was awesome as it combined the Rainforest, Aquarium as well as Planetarium all in one museum!Will return to this hotel for sure if we come back to San Francisco!",18-Aug-12,4
"I cannot find anything negative to say. Right upon checking in, a very friendly and attentive girl ""Jazelle"" had taken good care of us. She was aware of our 34th anniversary, and had champagne along with chocolate covered strawberries sent to our room. What a way to start an anniversary. So perfect! Our room on the 19th floor was cozy, comfortable, and very quiet. Best sleep. It had a great view of Union Sq. Thanks Jazelle! The location is close by to chinatown(5min. walk thru the tunnel). I continue walking north (10min. walk), and you can reach North Beach. There is a Starbucks across the St. and a 7-11 down the St. You can do some great shopping at the Westfield Mall, Largest Macy's, and much more. You can reach Japan Town within a 10-15 min. muni bus ride and ride back for free.About $2.00. Checkout is 12:00, but we requested a 1 Hour ext., and there was not a problem. The entire staff are always trying to assist your needs. Excellent hotel and service. Highly Recommend!",18-Aug-12,5
"Very friendly staff, modern and clean room, perfect location for every most important touristic location, eay to eat around hotel, the valet is a lintel expensive, but you can ask about the self parking garage with a normal price for union square and with privileage of in and out.",17-Aug-12,5
"It's hard to find fancy, upscale, romantic but not- overpriced accomodation in SF. I really wanted to book Four Seasons or Mandarin, but ended up booking Grand Hyatt and didn't regret! They had a nice package with included breakfast in their famous top view restaurant and valet parking. Everything was just perfect!",17-Aug-12,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for a trip to see family and friends. Although I've visited San Francisco many times for business and leisure, this is the first chance I had to stay at the Grand Hyatt. I picked it for several reasons - location, desire for Hyatt points, a reasonable rate for a downtown SF hotel, and the ability to use Amex points for 2 of the 5 night stay. The rooms were recently renovated and the furnishings were fabulous and much to my taste. The customer service of everyone ranging from front desk to housekeeping staff was exceptional. One minor drawback was that the lobby was much smaller than usual due to renovation so it was packed all the time. But again, the staff made up for it by their friendly demeanor. The location couldn't be beat. I had decided not to rent a car because of the cost and I didn't regret my decision for an instant. I walked everywhere, took BART to Oakland to see friends, and took the cable car from Ghirardelli Square. I had a few minor issues that were resolved at checkout and through a follow-up contact to my survey responses. Very impressive!!! I look forward to staying there again on future trips to the Bay area.",17-Aug-12,5
"I didn't expect much but we were very pleasantly surprised! They automatically put our room as a connecting room with our children. The rooms were perfect, great bathrooms. And the location is great! It's around the corner from union square. The concierge and other staff were very helpful.Breakfast is on the 36th floor, great view!! ( not included)So will definitely recommend this hotel!",17-Aug-12,5
"Excellent accomodations, location, check in/out, valet and staff! Beautiful 360 degree view from 35th floor lounge and the rooms are very clean with a modern decor and everything you might need is already in the room, right down to the toothpaste!. Simply a very quiet and comfortable two-day stay with so many good restaurants and shops within easy walking distance of the hotel.",16-Aug-12,5
"We were not very impressed with the lobby when we arrived. There is major renovation going on and the place is very dark, crowded with no where to even sit down. However, once we arrived at our room on the 30th floor, we were all very surprised. We asked for a connecting room and the front desk staff did try their best (even though it took a long time) to get us one. The view from the room is amazing. The newly renvoated rooms are very modern, trendy and spacious. Also make sure your try their gym, it is on the 35th floor, very modern equipment and excellent view with your work out.The location of this hotel is also excellent. It is right at union square with lots of shopping, restaruants and cafes nearby. I would not eat at their restaurant and pay $7 for an oatmeal when there are so many different diners and cafes nearby.Overall we are very happy with this hotel. Only one minor complaint is the $55 per day we have to pay for valet parking. The traffic is in sane in down town with all the renovations they are doing in building subways in downtown. It is actually quite difficult to do self parking.",15-Aug-12,4
"This hotel is well located, as it is very close to Union Square. It is a couple of minutes walk away from China Town as well, which was very convenient. The rooms have all been recently renovated, and have blinds that open and close at the push of a button....very exciting for the child in you!! However, the room felt quite small (considering you are in San Francisco, it doesn't really make much of a difference).The concierge was very warm and friendly, offering lots of tips of the best places to check out in the city. Overall, a very pleasant stay. We will definitely be returning in the future!",15-Aug-12,4
"I'll admit - this was my first time staying at a Grand Hyatt. I have stayed at other Hyatt porperties, though, so I had an idea of what to expect. Also, I got the rate through at bidding site, so my reference is a bit biased in that I saved quite a few $$$ from standard rates. The Grand Hyatt is located just off of Union Square. Chinatown is just steps away, and the Port of San Francisco (which I encourage people to visit) is only a 15 minute walk. The hotel is just down the street from numerous shopping venues, including large department stores. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, clubs, and lounges within walking distance. You're also around the corner from the cable car and other public transportation. The hotel itself is quite nice. The lobby is somewhat small for being called a ""Grand"" hotel. It wasn't crowded, though. Then again, I checked in at 4pm. Check-in was fast and efficient with all of my preferences being met (high floor, king-sized bed). The staff was attentive and encouraged me to contact them should anything come up. The hotel has 6 elevators and I never once waited for longer than 2 minutes for an elevator (going up or going down). The room itself is a bit small in comparison to other hotels in San Fran in this star rating. It was comfortable, though, and I found there was ample storage. There was also a sitting area next to the window and an office space. The bathroom was a decent size and feature a large sink (although, not a deep sink as they were going for aesthetics over function). The colours are burnt orange, browns, beige, whites, etc. Very stylish in my opinion and not overstated. I also found that the room was quite modern, which is part of their revitalization. I was very content with the bed and found I was able to sleep throughout the night without disturbance. During the stay, room service kept the space immaculate and were not intrusive at all. In fact, during my 3-night stay I did not see housekeping once yet my room was always made up in good time. There was one negative to the room. The room I had faced west. When I arrived, it felt like the room was overheating due to the sun beaming into the room. Even with the a/c running, it was like being outside in the sun and spraying yourself with mist...you can still feel the heat. And even though the a/c was on, I really couldn't tolerate the sun, so I had to put the shades down halfway. It was a shame as the room features floor-to-ceiling windows.Otherwise, the room was worth every penny. The location cannot be beat. The rooms are comfortable, modern, and clean. The level of attention to detail is very much what I would expect from an AAA Four Diamond hotel. Even with the issues from the sun, I would suggest this hotel to anyone looking for a great 4-star hotel in the heart of San Fran.",15-Aug-12,4
"Great experience! Being a Hyatt, I knew that this hotel would be lovely, but it was even better than I expected. First of all, let me say that in San Fran hotel rooms all tend to be small. When you come to San Fran, just expect that to be the case in any of the hotels, so that you won't be disappointed. What's wonderful about this Hyatt is that they make wonderful use of the space. It's clean, crisp and elegantly understated. The rooms have just been renovated and they are truly delightful. I had an amazing view of the city, and it was just the perfect downtown San Fran experience. The lobby is still under renovation, but that's no big deal at all, and the graciousness of the entire staff more than makes up for it. I was checked in by the lovely, Ms. Nikita Smalls, and she was so charming and full of genuine kindness. I was checked out by Steve Nietschke, and I was so impressed by his loyalty to the Hyatt brand and his knowledge about the hotel, Hyatt, and San Francisco. Just a wonderful experience! Housekeeping did an incredible job on our room everyday! I always leave a tip because housekeeping works so hard and they tend to be so under appreciated. My best personal tip for traveling, is if you want your room to get a bit of extra attention, leave a tip each day, don't wait until the end. It doesn't have to be a big tip, just something each day, and you would be amazed at the service housekeeping will provide. Oh, one last thing, the newly renovated gym is outstanding! One of the best hotel gyms I have ever seen. Great equipment, gorgeous views of the city, cool, and comfortable! Security in the gym area was also excellent, in that a bunch of irritating kids (too young, and irresponsible to be in the gym alone) were there banging the equipment, and security called their parents right away and took care of the situation. Great group of people working for Hyatt!",13-Aug-12,5
"We spent a night at this hotel last weekend and what a memorable stay it was.Things I loved about this hotel:- Very friendly concierge. As soon as we parked our car, there was someone waiting to park the car for us and offered help with our luggage.- The rooms are spacious and very well decorated. Loved the bed, big windows, clean bathroom, and best of all - an automatic switch to open/close the window shades.- Friendly staff- The rooftop bar with its great view of the city. The guy playing the piano was great too.Honestly, I wish my bedroom looked like the room at this hotel. I absolutely loved my stay. The hotel is right in the heart of Union Square, so just walk around the area, explore and have fun.Cannot wait to come back!!!!!",9-Aug-12,5
"My Wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights after marrying in Las Vegas. They upgraded us to the Grand Club which was excellent and David went out of his way to make sure we were looked after! We paid for a Bay View Room and were amazed at how good the view was from our room on the 31st floor, breath taking! The Buffet breakfast was good and George looked after us well! My only recommendation would be more variety at breakfast, such as cured meats. As others have stated the location is great. I would highly recommend this hotel.",8-Aug-12,5
"The rooms at The Hyatt are super, you don't need one of the highest floors to get a great view through the floor to ceiling windows but make sure you visit the sky bar for a drink because it really is a 'wow'. Beds are comfy, rooms have adequate space (could have been a bit more generous) and are spotlessly clean. I thought the design of the rooms was very attractive and hope that the lobby makeover is equally good.We arrived as a workers pay protest was about to start and whilst the bellboys were good I felt under huge pressure to get the cases out of the car, flung on a trolley, dump them in the lobby & get the car shifted pronto - that didn't create the best first impression. An email or text in advance warning me would have been helpful as I could have delayed our arrival a little to avoid the chaos.Reception team were welcoming & friendly. Concierge team helpful & answered our questions with great knowledge. Maids courteous and Mitch in the sky bar smashing! This was our second time in San Fran & I much preferred the Union Square location to Fishermans Wharf. The Wharf has been overrun with tacky tourist tat since our last visit but no worries, transport down to the Wharf on the Muni is easy and we found it walkable. My only doubt in terms of the Union Square location would be that work has just started digging up the road for what I understand relates to extending the underground, it's going to be going on for a while and did disturb us as work started early in the morning, light sleepers take your ear plugs just in case.I would recommend the Grand Hyatt to my friends, it was good value compared with hotels of a similar standard in the area.",8-Aug-12,4
"Cannot say enough about the staff at the Grand Hyatt SF. From checking in to checking out, the staff was amazing. The room was great, bed was great, the room was clean and everything was great, but my favorite part about the hotel was the concierge...John was AWESOME! He was funny, sincere, very helpful, but also wanted to make sure that I was safe but had a good time. All of concierge was great, from Liz to Joanne to Susan to Mark. But the best member of the concierge team was John. I just cannot say enough good things about him and the staff.",7-Aug-12,5
"We had a wonderful time at this Hotel, it is well placed central, the staff were awesome, the highlight was the breakfast buffet on the Top floor, we had a 360 view of the city.Would recommend this to anyone visiting San Fran.",7-Aug-12,5
This is a great hotel. Staff are very professional at all times: great to have a concierge who provided all the quick answers you need when you only have a short time. Because it is on Union Square we were close to China Town and the Powell Hyde Cable car line. The restaurant and piano bar on the 36th floor are must do because of the views but also the utterly professional hospitality. The food prices were no more than what we would pay at a decent pub back in Australia. Well done to the Grand Hyatt,4-Aug-12,5
"We had high expectations of this site given our marvellous experience of GH San Diego (refer separate review). The location of this site is right on Union Square; for us this was fabulous. Close to fabulous shops, restaurants, Chinatown, cable cars. Slightly longer walk to Pier 39 (we did it comfortably). The following experience substantially coloured our views of this site.We finished up a tour here and booked and prepaid three extra nights; two under the tour and one in our own names. When we handed over the vouchers, I stressed that this was not straight forward and could GH confirm they had us checking out on the right day. All confirmed.Given this, imagine my disappointment when I get the draft invoice under the door expecting us to check out early than we had prepaid. Took it up with the front desk who had no record of us staying the extra night at all. Further, the address was wrong and there were a whole lot of additional charges for parking. Given that we were on tour this was clearly wrong.We managed to contact the US agent of our travel adviser (Gullivers Travels - can thoroughly commend them on their efficiency) who confirmed we had a room and gave us a Hyatt confirmation number. I gave this to the front desk who still were not able to locate our booking and confirm the fact that the extra night had been paid for (Why??).3 hours later and three trips to the front desk, and thanks to the persistence of the front desk, the voucher for the extra night was located and we were back on track.There is something fundamentally wrong with GH San Fran's systems.As noted on other reviews, the refurb of the lobby is underway. We had one night with jack hammers going to 9.00 pm. Not what we expected.Breakfasts not as extensive as GH San Diego.My sense is that when things work, GH San Fran would be great. This was just not our experience this time round.",4-Aug-12,3
"My fiance and I just returned from our vacation and I just had to post what a fantastic stay we had at this property. Yes, the lobby is in the midst of a remodel, but it was no problem at all and a lot less problematic than I had anticipated--and I'm VERY picky. John, the concierge, was FANTASTIC. He gave us some great suggestions for a walking tour and casual dining where the locals go, which is always better in my opinion. When we passed by the desk the rest of our stay, he was always quick with a smile and a wave. And Mitch, our waiter in the bar on the 36th floor was great, too. When the bartender miss poured a black and tan (he didn't use the spoon!), Mitch was quick to correct him, show him the proper technique, and bring my fiance a new drink. Really, top-notch service. San Fran has a lot of hotels and most of them are expensive, but the Grand Hyatt is worth every penny.",4-Aug-12,5
I've stayed at the hotel several times......the new rooms are wonderful. Bed is also great! The lobby is getting remodeled and I'm sure will be nice as well. Just be warned if you park your car it can cost up to $49 per night!!,3-Aug-12,5
"My husband and I stayed 7 nights at the Grand Hyatt. We actually spent very very little time at the hotel but overall it was a nice stay.Pros: location, comfy bed, hardwood floors in room, friendly and helpful staff, the views of the bay from the top floor barCons: LOUD (we were on the 31st floor overlooking union square and it was a party every night. Also you can hear attached neighbors every move and every word), lobby is a mess (yes, I know it's under renovation but it's still a bummer especially since these rooms are 300$ + a night!).All in all a good hotel in a amazing city!",2-Aug-12,4
"After staying at each of the Hyatt's in the city, this ranks as my second favorite. The one at the Embarcadero has a better location for what I like. This hotel is still under remodeling work so the lobby was cramped, busy and small. However, our room on the 24th floor was new and clean. I like the new rooms.As always service was good, but not always prompt. The concierge was overwhelmed and there was a line. She booked tickets for me with a smile and was accommodating. Valet and the bellhop were friendly.The location was close to Union Square, shopping, and the cable cars. These things were in walking distance of the lobby.I think the hotel was overpriced for the overall condition of the hotel. Until the remodel is done, try to the Hyatt in the financial district.",2-Aug-12,4
"We had a great 3-day stay at the grand Hyatt, which demonstrated excellence even before we got there! Two weeks prior to our visit, the second week in July, I realized the tickets to Alcatraz were sold out, I searched the Internet and had no success on any type of package. I called Elaine, one of the concierge prior to our stay. She was a lifesaver, and hooked us up in a combination hop on hop off tour combined with an Alcatraz trip trip that was terrific! We were also able to get an early check-in, a beautifully appointed room with floor-to-ceiling windows, motorized window shade, and beautiful city view. Contrary to other reviews, the room DID have a coffee maker, which is very important to me. The only hicup that we encountered our whole trip, was that in-room safe was not working at check-in. It took quite some time for it to be fixed, to compensate the manager says up a bottle of wine, cheese and antipasto meats, very nice!! The view from the lounge and restaurant on the top floor is beautiful. We enjoyed dinner one evening with nice piano accompaniment. We also enjoyed Buffet breakfast one morning. The 35th floor fitness center also shares the same stunning view as the restaurant, which made it very enjoyable to work out and look out on the city. The rooms have all been renovated very recently, which made my very fussy husband very happy. In addition to the bathroom, there is a separate make up area, which is very nice when you have two people sharing one bathroom. Location is great, close to Union Square and lots of transportation. Elaine, Liz, & the other concierge were all extremely helpful in suggestions for restaurants and getting around in San Francisco. They even set up a rental car, that was delivered directly to the hotel, making our exit to the Pacific Coast very easy. we were able to buy half-price tickets also, to a great musical Beach Blanket Babylon across the street at Union Square. As noted, the lobby is under construction. However, that really had no effect on our wonderful stay at the grand Hyatt San Francisco. Fantastic customer service, we would definitely return.",31-Jul-12,5
"The Grand Hyatt has an upscale modern decor. (At the time of this writing they are however re-contructing the lobby) We had a room facing Union Square. The corner room is far more spacious than usual hotel fare.Our room included a comfy bed, automatic window shades, generous bath. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The Grand Hyatt is a great launching point for your vacation or business trip. The hotel is convenient to Union Square with its many shopping and dining destinations. Great spot to stay in San Francisco.",31-Jul-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt is the probably one of the buildings that make up the gorgeous SF skyline. Unfortunately, my request for a room with a view was rewarded with one looking over a parking lot on the 7th floor. But no matter. The room was clean, the bed super comfortable, and the bathroom even had a rain shower, which was a real treat. What I loved about this hotel was that they had ""Floor to ceiling windows with electronic blackout roller"", which was perfect for my early bedtimes. The location of the hotel was top notch, and it was easy to find and walk to the restaurants and services that I needed. As expected in a place like this, prices of room service were very much over the top. It was a pity that the reception area was under construction, and I would be curious to see the renovated product. All in all a good experience.",31-Jul-12,4
"My wife and I stayed in the Grand Hyatt for 3 nights from 21st June on our return to the UK from Hawaii. We thought San Fran would be a good place to stop on our return leg to break up the journey. We arrived just before midnight, but were checked in quickly and off to our room. We were immediately impressed by the room. It was spacious and very modern, and the bathroom was gleaming and very nicely laid out. Compared to rooms we had in the two Hyatt Regency Hotels we stayed in during our Hawaii trip, which were very good, the room in the Grand was light years ahead. The bed was wonderful and we slept really well. I canâ€™t say we had problems with noise either inside or outside, but we were up high enough to be remote from the traffic, and were never disturbed by our fellow residents. We had breakfast each morning in the Grandview restaurant and were impressed with the absolutely stunning views while we ate a very good breakfast. We had window seats every time. Breakfast was well stocked, with a very good choice. We spoke to reception and they were extremely helpful with arranging an Alcatraz Tour and booking tickets for the â€œHop On- Hop Offâ€ù bus tour of the City. The reception staff was brilliant at getting everything arranged in no time. Very professional and efficient. They also provided tips for good restaurants when we visited Fishermanâ€™s Wharf. We took their advice and were glad we did. The lobster and sea bass at the Fog Restaurant was delicious. The location of the Hotel is excellent, yards from Union Square and the big department stores. Easy walk to Chinatown, and great for local restaurants and bars. My wife and I are big fans of the excellent Cajun style meals at â€œThe Cheesecake Factoryâ€ù and that is right on Union Square. Only a 5 minute walk to dinner from the hotel, absolutely perfect. The Tour buses also stop at Union Square, so it is in a great location. One thing I personally liked was that there was an area external to the hotel which was sectioned off and set aside for smokers, which was remote and non interruptive for non-smokers, and was equipped with benches, and even outdoor heaters for chilly evenings, a very thoughtful touch. I wish more hotels gave a bit of thought for smokers. We had lunch once at the Grandview Bar which was very good, and also visited there each evening, where they have a resident piano player. The views from the bar are awesome, especially watching the fog roll in and roll out as the sun goes down. The staff in the bar is friendly and efficient and we enjoyed chilling out there in the evening after sightseeing the City all day. There is an ATM in the foyer which is handy, but what I especially liked was the automatic airline check-in service they have in reception. A touch screen computer has all the airlines listed and you can check-in online effortlessly. Another nice modern touch Iâ€™ve rarely seen in hotels worldwide. Our flight back to the UK was delayed by almost 5 hours, and the hotel stored our luggage till our revised pick up time while we set off round town for a last minute blitz. The concierge service is really top notch. I know the reception area was under renovation, but this really didnâ€™t detract from the excellent standards of the hotel, and itâ€™s highly professional staff. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, and would highly recommend it for a stay in San Francisco. I can be critical of hotels. When staying 4 and 5 star, you expect high standards, and the Grand Hyatt certainly did not disappoint.",29-Jul-12,5
"I've stayed at this Hyatt now at least a dozen times, mostly for work. And I like it ... here's why.* REALLY reasonably priced, in my opinion (often under $200/night on Hyatt.com)* awesome location (Union Square, but also adjacent to Chinatown)* close to BART (same line as SFO)* clean* directly across the street from a Starbucks, and a block away from a Walgreen's* a few steps away from great shopping and streetcars * Internet allows for three devicesAlthough there were some hiccups with my stay this month:* the lobby is being renovated, so it's a bit of a mess* there are labor negotiations going on, and there was a VERY loud two-hour protest just under my window* our room faced Stockton street, and the incessant whistle that beckons the cabs gets old fast* the afghan at the foot of our bed had holes burned in itBut overall, the Hyatt -- along with the W and Taj Campton Place -- will always be my first choice when coming to San Fran.",28-Jul-12,4
"By far the best view in San Francisco....Stunning! The hotel is still under construction in the lobby area so nothing to speak about here..the room was very comfortable, clean and recently renovated. Too bad that at $300 a night the shower had no water pressure and I had to squeeze against the wall to get the water to spray on me for a shower....that was really very surprising. I understand SF is water conscious, but this was ridiculous. All they really need to do is put a longer extension on the shower...I guess they think that because the guest can use it as a hand-held that it is sufficient, but it isn't. Sorry Hyatt-you really missed the mark here.",27-Jul-12,4
"Beautiful, clean, rooms,new bathrooms, great views from all angles. Excellent resturant for dinner and breakfast with views of the city. Centrally located, few blocks from the first stop of the cable cars. Excellent conceierge services. Busy lobby, overcrowded, however, they are in the process of renovations.",26-Jul-12,5
"One of our bucket list trips. We had a fantastic trip to San Francisco, I booked our flight and hotel through Price Line, they did a great job! We stayed in the Hyatt Regency on Stockton Street for an extra $50.00 we got all the treatment including a room on the 30th floor with a brilliant view of the Bay and Alcatraz. I also had a small car and drove to Sausolito one of our most favorite places in fact we drove there on two separate occasions. We went to Alcatraz, a boat trip under the Golden Gate Bridge, along the Pacific HWY, looked at the RedWoods, we did almost everything possible. Only had two things to gripe about, first the Bus Tour we wanted to take around the city payed $30 each for a 20 minute ride down to Fisherman's Wharf then wait there for another 20 minuets then drive back. After we got back and complained it was only then it was explained to us, the tickets were for two days and you can ride all or any Buses anywhere in the city, if we known this at the beginning of our visit it would have been cheeper for us to use the Bus system and saw more sites rather paying out high parking fees. The other issue was American Airlines they would not allow us to book our seats on line because we used Price Line. My money is as good as anyone else's it's not my fault they sell cheep tickets and I purchased them for that I'm discriminate.",26-Jul-12,5
"The renovation is great and the hotel staff was excellent. Many of the employees have been working at the hotel for over 20 years .... and its shows. They are attentive, friendly and well informed. I stayed here during a big conference and the hotel was sold out and very busy. Believe me you wouldn't know it by the type of service that was shown by this team. Thanks to Micheal the valet and greeter out front, Ben the Bellman, Rafeal at the cafe. A few suggestions...1) The phone lines often rang without anyone picking up 2) keep the Club open a bit longer to accommodate the guests during big conferences",26-Jul-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt is in the final stretches of a big renovation. The room design is very fresh and modern. I love the remote controlled blackout shade. Right from the bed! There is also an innovative scrim in front of the windows to allow for light and a modicum of privacy.King bed was comfortable and lighting was good in the bathroom. Very nice fixtures and furnishings throughout.A few concerns:Water pressure was AWFUL!Door was undercut to such a degree that hallway lights filled the room while I was trying to sleep.A/C unit was a rattle trap, though temperature was good.Overall a nice stay, but it didn't win my repeat business. I'll try something else next time just to see how it compares.",25-Jul-12,3
"Pros:(1) room was fairly spacious and recently renovated(2) the wifi was free (Gold Passport member) and fast -- an important touch that distinguishes the Hyatt brand from Starwood and others, for me(3) the gym is nice and it has some fantastic views while using the cardio equipment(4) the food delivered by room service was very good(5) laundry service was very prompt (clothes returned the same day)Cons:(1) very noisy - you could hear everything from outside the hotel (32 floors down from my room), everything in the adjoining room, and everything in the hallway outside the room. It was made worse by the fact that the hotel rooms' doors do not close gently, so you are awoken in the morning by a series of slamming doors in your hall.(2) towards the end of my stay I started noticing small bumps that appeared to be bites on my skin (arms, ankles, chest), which I suspect may have been caused by an allergic reaction to laundry detergent used on my clothes or the bed sheets. (3) the TVs are nice, but they offer very few high definition channels, and limited programming in general when compared to many hotels(4) not a big fan of the soap/bathing products offered by the Hyatt chain",25-Jul-12,3
"My husband and I stayed here last month. The hotel is in a great location in Union Square, within walking distance to shopping, Chinatown, and public transport. Was a bit surprised upon arrival at how small and basic the lobby was because of the renovations. But once we got to our room we were very happy with it. The room is really nicely renovated, pretty spacious for a SF hotel, the bathroom was very nice also. Everything seems really new so it was especially nice. Great desk area for business travelers, very efficient use of space in the design of the room. The bed was really comfy but maybe a little too soft? May not be good if you have a bad back. The products in the bathroom such as the shampoo and lotion smelled great. :) Also had a lovely view of the city with the Coit Tower and the Transamerica pyramid building, and the bay in the distance. We didn't utilize any of the hotel amenities like the restaurants or gym..didn't even look at them since we were only there for three days and wanted to get out and explore San Fran. When we got to the airport on the way home I realized I had forgotten my ipad in the hotel safe! Can't believe I did that. The safe is a bit hidden in a cabinet so it's easy to forget, it's not in the closet like at a lot of other hotels. However I called the hotel and was immediately patched to the Hotel Security. A very nice man in Security sent someone to check the room and arranged to have the ipad FedEx'ed back to me. The hotel didn't pay for the shipping but it was my fault so I didn't expect them to. The ipad arrived and was packed up very well with bubble wrap. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt.",25-Jul-12,4
We stayed for 4 nights and felt as though our location to things was great. Aside from fisherman's wharf - we were able to walk everywhere we went. Plenty of restaurants and shops within a mile of the hotel. We were very pleased with the rooms and the friendliness and helpfullness of the staff. ,25-Jul-12,4
"Not bad. Perfectly accommodating and generous concierge service. A very early checkout (3am) meant the Concierge was forced out on the street to hail three cabs for our party without a complaint. One word of advice, if you do book the bay view you may like to check exactly how high up you are. Our view had glimpses of said bay (not withstanding the famous fog!) but nice enough non the less. WE got in early, the gentleman at the check in desk said our room was not ready but he could offer us a room a few floors down for showering after a long flight, I declined and said I'd rather wait for the allocated room but I suspect we were given the room on floor 20 non the less, but don't really know to be fair.By far this hotel's best feature is the bar on the top floor. Absolutely stunning, you will want to stay all day and night to watch the changing vista.Worth a stay!",25-Jul-12,4
"I spent 7 nights a the Grand Hyatt and my room was exceptional. The rooms had recently been redone and were very modern and very friendly for business and CPAPs. They have very nice lighting where you need it and plug-ins in all the right places. The view from the 25th floor was great. They were remodeling the lobby, so that wasn't nice, but the pictures of what it was going to look like looked very nice. I would recommend this hotel. All staff were very helpful and attentive.",24-Jul-12,4
"We stayed here while the reception was still being renovated. Our rooms was newly renovated and both the room and bathroom was nice. Not very big, but big enough. We had booked a special deal with parking included, which was nice since that's difficult and expensive in central SF. The hotel was next door to China Town and very nice shopping areas, so the location couldn't be better. 4th of July we spent in the bar at the top of the hotel. Very nice atmosphere, and nice views. For eating as well, I'd recommend the bar for value and views, compared to the next door restaurant.",23-Jul-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt is very conveniently located in Union Square and i was thrilled to have my hotel room not only face the square, but look directly at the Cheesecake Factory sign! The room is well appointed and the bathroom appears to have been recently renovated. There is a fridge in the room which comes in handy, as well as a coffee maker. The room was quiet and enjoyable to be in. Was this the nicest hotel room ever?? No, but it was a nice Grand Hyatt. The lobby is undergoing renovations. Hotels are expensive in San Francisco and I think that we did well with the Hyatt.",23-Jul-12,4
"This past weekend i stayed with my wife and two kids (7yrs and 1yr old) at this hotel and have nothing but good things to say about it. it was about a 20min drive from the airport and the key of this place among other things is the location. Its only 2 blocks from Macy's, the Disney Store, Union Square, 3 blocks from ChinaTown, 10 min walk to the Embarcadero and financial district and 1 block away from the train that you could take to fisherman's wharf (Pier 39 etc). It also had a starbucks across the street and a wallgreens a block away for what ever was need it. My daughter made us have breakfast everyday (i didnt use the hotel restaurant) at a dinner called Lori's a block away (great food, kids friendly and well priced) which as per her was oficially her favorite place in SF.Our room on the 15th floor had a great view and a pretty good blackout system because this time of the year the room can get pretty hot during the day. The hotel was very busy but had plenty of elevators (6) so waiting for one was never a long wait. The people working at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful and when my wife requested a roll up bed for our daughter and a crib for our baby boy it didnt take them more than 5 min to come back with everything.Nothing but a good time and good service.Maybe the only ""but"" is the parking price (between $35-50) per night.. ouch... but i'm guessing that's probably the same in everyplace in down town.I would be happy to come back to this place.",23-Jul-12,4
"Even though the hotel is under construction for renovation, the service and rooms were perfect! The staff was so helpful. We had great curb~side service, and check in was a breeze. The concierge helped with a map and pointed out some great ideas to see in the city. The also helped with booking some museums on our second day. Rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. You must go up to the 36th (top floor) floor for a drink and the best sites of San Francisco. The only thing I would recommend is a higher floor room. We stayed on 5th floor and the street is very noisy and busy.",22-Jul-12,5
"My wife and I stayed 5 nights in early July. We had just gotten platinum status, so there was a complimentary upgrade to a Grand Club room.Good stuff: * Awesome views. One room was on the 29th, one on the 33rd floor. (more on that later) every direction had a spectacular view. * Renovated rooms are quite nice. See attached photos. * The grand club has lots of good stuff, and a wonderful view of coit tower. * Convenient location, less than a block from union square. Cons:* This was summer travel season, and the grand club was overrun with men, women and children. Not that Hyatt could do much about this, but it highlighted the fact that the club was too small for the occupancy of the floors it serves. * Nearly every room in the hotel has a ""connecting room."" Good for families, but bad for travelers that don't want to hear their neighbors. * Reduced elevator count due to the construction. But that should be better soon. Final anecdote (belongs in the pros section):When spent the first night on 29, we had an extremely loud neighbor. The front desk was very accommodating, and relocated us to 33. (They told us there are less than 10 non-connecting rooms in the hotel.) Unfortunately, the room they moved us to was *also* connecting. When they realized this mistake, they marked the room next to us as out of service do that we'd enjoy our stay. This shows exceptional service, as it's a very difficult thing to do during peak travel season. So, the service would get a Tripadvisor rating of ""11"", if we could give them that. :)",22-Jul-12,4
"You can't really ask for a better location. I got a great deal on the room because the lobby was being renovated, so I was thrilled with the quality of the room, etc. The lounge on the top floor is fantastic, especially at sunset.",21-Jul-12,5
"Our room was $289/night without a view. We stayed on the 6th floor, but could only really see the backs of buildings. Went back to check-in to see if any other rooms were available, but were told the hotel was sold out for the night- fair enough. The location itself is great, right on Union Square and convenient to everything. The lobby was under construction, but well-staffed. We had drinks at the bar on the top floor, where you are really paying for the view (over $50 for 3 drinks!). That bar was a little outdated, but the rooms were nice and updated with plenty of room.",21-Jul-12,3
"Stayed here while lobby under renovation. Room 2826 very modern and comfortable. Nice king bed, electric shade, and fridge. IPod charger in room.Restaurat in hotel very nive for the view and worth a splurge. Spent $120 for 2 with no alcohol.Location is excellent. Close to everything union square has to offer.Try lori's dinner down the block for a cheap meal to take back to the room.",20-Jul-12,4
"My husband and I flew in early to San Francisco, and at busier hotels in the city like this one, we are used to checking our luggage in with the hotel in order to be checked in around three. When we arrived at 10 a.m. to turn our bags over, the desk clerk told us that he had a room ready for us and that no wait was necessary. This gave us the full first day of exploring the city without having to plan around for the standard checkin hour, and it was the greatest convenience. We stayed three nights, and loved our time at the Hyatt. The room was affordable for the location and even though construction was going on, we never had to wait for an elevator or were at all inconvenienced by the renovation. Our room was lovely on the 16th floor- it really could not have been a better stay!",18-Jul-12,5
"Great Hyatt right in the of town, with everything on your door step. We were in town for a concert, so only had 2 nights and 1 day. The hotel is ideally situated for most of the sights, and as a great walking city all within easy reach.The lobby is still work in progress, so the entrance doesn't instill too much confidence that you chose the right hotelAll rooms have been recently renovated and it's one of the best non Andaz or PH Hyatt's in the US I've stayed in. The views from the Regency Club are fantastic - ask one of the folks there how you can get outside for great photo's of the city and out to Alcatraz. The food in the club is better than most other RC's I've been in.A very good value hotel.Good suggestions from Anthony Bourdain's recent visit on Travel Channel's Layover, especially Blue Bottle coffee, which is a 10 min walk from the hotel.",18-Jul-12,5
"Very convenient to downtown and Union Square. Stayed on a high floor, floor and room were both nicely redone (lobby still has a lot of work going on). Seemed like a recent, in-progress renovation - yet aspects of the room felt run down. Room design is very modern, bed was comfortable but pillows were too small and too soft. Bathroom is a nice size, though shower setup (half a glass wall, so you're afraid of splashing the rest of the bathroom) was a little odd. Fixtures are so modern that you can't figure out how they work quickly. Sink faucet was loose (which made it even harder to figure out how to turn on), desk chair was a great modern design but had a screw loose. Bed wasn't quite made - didn't tuck in sheets - which I've never seen in any hotel let alone one that thinks $259 is a ""special rate."" No matter how hard I tried, I could not read the details on the clock radio phone thing - even with my reading glasses on - so I did not actually set the alarm properly so it didn't go off. Room service breakfast was absurdly expensive with a 19%! service charge - though it did come quick. Gym was very small such a big hotel - every machine was full when I went up before work time. OK - so maybe I didn't really like this hotel :)",17-Jul-12,3
"I stayed in room 523 for a long weekend. I requested a quiet room and while there was no view, it was very quiet. The rooms are newly decorated and beautiful. The beds are to die for. So comfy. Everything is clean, service is impeccable and friendly. Rayes are extremely reasonable for SF on Union Square. Sutter Stockton Parking lot is on next block. Union Square shopping is less than a block. Cable car and Chinatown one and a half block. Do yourself a favor and stay here. You won't regret it. Also, try breakfast or lunch at the 37th floor restaurant. Great view, good food.",16-Jul-12,5
"Perfect location. You're right in the heart of the city, surrounded by all of the shops and restaurants. Cable cars are a couple of blocks away, as are the buses and f line team.The room was very clean and servicable. We were on the 26th floor so viewscwere great and there wa no noise issue. Lifts were very busy in the morning - coming own 26 floors stoppingvt every on was not unusual!We did not eat in the restaurant as the cost was ludicrous. We did think about going to th bar one night - but at $9 for a bottle of beer we thought better of it!One particular pain for us was the fact that wifi was no free but $10 a day. Given that we were paying top dollar for the room i found this a little galling. Thankfully starbucks across the road has free wifi so we were able to check reviews, itineraries etc before heading out or the day.Make sure that you go to uncle vito's pizza round the corner for takeout pizza - fantastic and cheap! We also bought stuff for breakfast from 7 11 also around the corner ad the room had a fridge.",16-Jul-12,4
"This hotel has a great location, just down the street from Union Square where there is tonnes of great shopping. Also the perfect spot to hop on a bus tour. The hotel has just been extensively reno'd, with the hotel lobby yet to be completed. We had a view of Coight Tower from our hotel, and could see the bay when the cloud coverage passed (You need to be on a fairly high floor to see this). Our room was nice and clean with your standard amenities. Great value for the location.",15-Jul-12,4
"Stayed here with my wife for 6 nights at the start of July.Had read many TA reviews beforehand so interested to find out for myself.First thing to say is that the location is superb. Just off Union Square and literally only 5-10 minutes walk to most of what you need to find in the area. To visit Chinatown is only 5 minutes away and we went to North Beach for dinner and that only took about 15 minutes.Rooms themselves are well appointed with VERY comfy beds. Shower OK though can understand some peoples comments about the pressure, not huge but allright. If you can, get on a higher floor as there's a lot of work going on at the moment (moreso the first couple of floors), but San Francisco can be noisy at night and you're insulted from this the higher up you go. And the views are stunning. Lobby area is currently under renovation so a right bloody mess but in a couple of months should be much improved. Service was efficient, if at times a little stiff. Had an issue with a charge at the top floor restaurant and the front desk guy was a little dismissive about it, but the manager at Grandviews (Gordon) really went out of his way to sort it out. Well done to him and this is an awesome establishment with a great view. Try the salads which are world class.In the local area there is a laundromat up Sutter Street, Starbucks across the road with free internet, and a 7-11 a minute away on Stockton Street towards the tunnel (with $1 cans of coke, bagels etc.).This hotel is a really good option for San Francisco and would not hesitate to stay there again.",13-Jul-12,5
"I loved the modern feel if the room. The sliding door in the bathroom was a nice touch. Everything was clean which is a big plus. Steve at the front desk was very nice, hope to stay here next time I an in San Francisco.",13-Jul-12,5
"First the good points. The staff were very helpful at check in. They even provided me with some free toiletries that I had forgotten to pack. The room was good, the wifi worked well. But for me, the big problem was the noise. Imagine stilletto heels on marble at the rate of a woodpecker going all night ... As I was deperately trying to recover from jetlag I called reception to complain and was told that this is normal. Its a side effect of the earthquake protection that the hotel is equipped with. When I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Taipei I dont remember the same noises. Maybe I was just unlucky with my room.",13-Jul-12,2
"Nicely located in Union Square, so great shopping in area. Cable cars 2 blocks away. Rooms are OK size, nice view. Bizarre oval sink in bathroom. Too low pressure in shower. Ice machine next to our room was noisy.Very clean rooms. Comfy beds.Extremely noisy bar on top floor. Very impersonal, mediocre drinks. Several people asked waitress where they could find a place to talk. She didn't help them. Skip the bar. Just no ambience.Good breakfast on 36th floor with great views. Typically overpriced.Lobby is being refurbished. Looks awful now. Hopefully pretty when done, but not now. Compared to the St. Francis down the street, it's kinda pathetic looking now.I've stayed in far nicer Hyatts, but it's not terrible. Just not great.",11-Jul-12,3
"This hotel isin a great location, just off Union Square. The rooms were clean, modern and a relatively good size. The service in the hotel was spot on too. However I just can't give this place 5 stars as it was just lacking that something you feel when you go to somewhere properly good. ",10-Jul-12,4
"I stayed there for 3 nights. I've always stayed in hyatt or westin when i travel, but i think this is the smallest and lowest ceilling room hotel of all hyatt hotels i have ever stayed before. The service is also not so good. I travelled with 2 children, one is 4.5yo and the other one still 1.5yo. Thus i still need to make their milk all time then i requested for electric water kettle and the room service they don't have that kind of electric water kettle in the hotel and she offered me to deliver a hot water inside a regular water kettle. I was very dissapointed and told her that all hyatt hotels that i have stayed before always has electric water kettle. The she said she will talk to the manager. 10 minutes after i hang up with the room service, a hotel staff delivered a electric water kettle and said that's their last one. I was just wondering why would she lied to me in the first place. She could just have told me that they are out of it. Basically i think the hotel is just ok for hyatt standard, but for sure the hotel location is one of the best in union square sf after the westin st francis hotel.",10-Jul-12,3
"We stayed four nights and loved every minute of it. Staff was very friendly, rooms were beautiful, Grand Club was beautiful with excellent food and service. Surprisingly quiet room, especially being at a Union Square. The room was immaculate. The beds were luxurious. Our car was brought around very quickly from the Valet. $50 for valet parking may seem high, but not for a big city. We will be back, and soon! Thank you Hyatt for a wonderful stay. This review is written by a mom with very particular preferences for hotel stays. Excellent reviews are the exception from this writer. ",9-Jul-12,5
"Very nice hotel in lower Nob Hill, usually stay at a Hilton in SFO, this far exceeded my expectations. Rooms were modern, comfortable and of good size. Had one small issue with a noisy a/c fan and they quickly moved me to another room. I will be back.",9-Jul-12,4
"I recently stayed here on a business trip and was pleased with the hotel. This is a great place if you are looking for somewhere close to Union Square with plenty of shopping and restaurants just steps from the front door. The room was quite nice, with recently updated, modern, and stylish decor. The food at the restaurant was also surprisingly good -- much better than I tend to expect at chain hotels. And the view of the Bay from the restaurant/bar area is absolutely stunning (worth a look even if you don't stay for food/drinks). The concierge was very helpful in arranging taxis and airport shuttles, and the front desk staff were courteous. My only complaint at this hotel would be the lack of free wireless internet.",9-Jul-12,4
"don't bother unless you get the government rate of $155 per room and the 32 floor lounge for an additional $45. the beds are great but the bathrooms have a horrible oval sink, the water pressure in the shower is poor and the airconditioning is noisy.",9-Jul-12,3
I stayed at this hotel while managing an event and I have never been greeted so cheerfully by members of staff from all departments! It was wonderful to be greeted by every staff member that walked by with smiles and hellos! I had everything I needed and everything ran smoothly and perfectly thanks to the glorious staff members here! The room was nice as well! Thank you!,8-Jul-12,5
"My family and I spent six days/nights at the Gran Hyatt. The Hotel was clean and we felt very safe. The location is great and we were able to walk to many of the attractions in the area. The valet was very good and we had no problems getting our car in and out. We loved the lounge on the 36th floor, we stopped there at the end of each evening. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting SF.",8-Jul-12,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for one night while traveling on business. The lobby area was going through a renovation during my stay (July 2012). Hotel is perfectly located very near Union Square. Valet parking is very expensive, but this is San Francisco. Staff was quite friendly. Club Lounge on 32nd floor is spacious and has great views. Rooms are recently upadated and very modern. The view from my room was amazing! This hotel is a definite recommendation if within your budget.",8-Jul-12,4
"We have stayed at this hotel a number of times and we were always very satisfied with the whole experience. We were just there last week and found out they plan to close the restaurant and the lounge on the 36th floor. I am not a fan of hotel food, although we found the food at the restaurant to be very respectable. What really bothers me is the closing of the lounge, we always went up for a drink before dinner, and to take in the tremendous view. Very few hotels in the city have a bar with such great views, it will be missed. We were told it will become a room for business meetings, etc. I wish they would reconsider this move, it is one of the reasons we keep coming back.",8-Jul-12,4
"We checked-in here with no trouble at all as they have these clever check-in machines (as well as people behind a desk) that give you your room keys and everything. The room was super nice. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and room service was fantastic. We had partial views over Union Square which was nice. Probably one of the quietest hotels I have stayed at. Close to everything and far enough away from the Tenderloin area which is something I would recommend, especially for travelers who don't have an overwhelming amount of homelessness where they are from..........it was actually quite shocking the amount of homeless etc in San Francisco.",8-Jul-12,5
Great location; average rooms; no lobby during construction; restaurant was average; prefer Hyatt at Embarcadero,7-Jul-12,3
what can I say arrived great reception staff great room good for local bars came in early hours after a night out night staff great no complaints on this hotel,7-Jul-12,5
Just came back from a one night stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Fran. Did not spend much time at the hotel (basically to sleep) but the staff impressed me enough to write a review. From the valet parking attendant (the cost is highway robbery at $50 a night) to the gentleman who checked me in at the front desk - everyone was very professional and welcoming. Thank you. The room was average Hyatt but would have been good for staying several days. The hotel is down by the water which is a nice place to walk. There a good places to eat in the area. I decided on a restuarant I have been going to for years - Boulevard - which was again great.,4-Jul-12,4
"I recently stayed here for 9 nights with my partner and overall was very impressed. For tourists to San Fran, the hotel could not be better located. It's right by Union Square so very close to all the shops and restaurants in the downtown area. It's also just down the road from the China Town area and well located for public transport (Powell St MUNI and BART stations are less than five minutes walkaway) so it really is a great base for exploring this fantastic city. The staff were friendly and generally helpful. I mentioned on check in that we were staying for my partner's 40th birthday and within ten minutes of arriving at our room, reception had sent up two cakes and a bottle of red wine. It was a lovely gesture! We were originally assigned a room on the 16th floor and it was a little noisy outside. When my partner mentioned this the following morning, we were switched to a room on a higher floor. This was perfectly quiet and of course, the views were much better! Our room was large and very clean. Make sure that you go to the bar on the 36th floor. The views are awesome and it's a lovely space to relax with a glass of wine after a hard day's sightseeing or shopping. The only downsides were that the hotel's lobby area was a bit cramped and chaotic but this was no doubt because that area of the hotel was in the middle of a renovation. Also there is no free WiFi, either in the rooms or reception. This is obviously a drawback in this day and age. But for this, the hotel would have received 5/5 from me. On the whole though, a great choice and I'd stay here again.",3-Jul-12,4
When we stayed at the hotel it's lobby was under renovation. So there is little on can say about that. But the rooms have been renovated and are nice and clean. The staff is really courteous and helpful. The roof top restaurant and bar is a great place. China town is just walking distance. The only thing that I thought needed improvement was the TV quality and the quality of programming. I would definitely stay here again. ,3-Jul-12,4
"I had a recent trip to San Fran and decided to bring the family so we could see the wonderful city - we primarily stayed here because I was speaking at a conference, which meant I got some pretty good room ratesWhat was good?- newly renovated rooms (a little small, but nice)- location - nice place to jump off to all the places we visited- nice views - go up and have breakfast or a drink on the top floor - beautiful!- the staff - very friendly and helpful - concierge staff were greatWhat could be better?- lobby was under renovation- parking in hotel was a fortune!- gym faces east and was really hot in the morningAll in all, we had a great time and enjoyed our stay - we did not use many of the hotel amenities (note no pool on premises) but enjoyed our stay",1-Jul-12,4
"Our room was modern, clean, and had a great view of Union Square.This hotel is great. It's right on Union Square, so is a great location for transport and getting round the city. Market St is five minutes away for great shopping, and China Town is close.",1-Jul-12,5
"one of the 10 hotels we stayed at during our 16 night group trip to west USA , 8 Harley's and 1 carstayed 2 nights here , booked through Priceline.com at a very good rateNice rooms , comfortable beds , all you would expect from a 4*We only had some discussions about the parking rates for our bikes It took us more than a 1/2 hour dicussion to finally pay less to the parking garage , which was independent from the hotel , than originally agreed by phone !the garage manager was very helpfull and friendlyLocation is great , right next to Union Square and all transportation , cablecars , etc...Had breakfast across the street in Starbuckswould come here again , but not on the regular rates which are to high",1-Jul-12,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for the weekend. We booked a package with parking and breakfast for two. The hotel is centrally located in Union Square. We walked to the Embarcadero, Fisherman's Wharf and Ghiradelli Square from the hotel. It was a bit of a walk and if you aren't in any hurry walking a great way to experience the city. We also took a cab down to Pier 39 one day and that was about $15. After leaving the car at the valet it wasn't really worth it to drive around the city since parking is at such a premium. The cable car line wasn't far but was always very busy so we never rode it. There is great shopping and dining close by the hotel. The staff at the hotel was great and very helpful with everything we asked. The restaurant on the 36th floor has great views of the city. Fey who works at the restaurant in the morning was very friendly and provided fantastic service. The room was very clean and modern. The view from the higher floors is fantastic and I'd recommend staying as high as you can. If you are a light sleeper, even on the 26th floor we heard sirens at night but that was not a big deal for us.",30-Jun-12,5
"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights because I was attending a conference at the Moscone center. I had my daughter and husband with me and we were very comfortable in our room with 2 double-beds. We had a refrigerator, safe and coffee maker in the room. Remote controlled shades and the floor to ceiling window in the room is a wonderful treat as well. If you are coming to SF for a conference at the nearby Moscone center, it is an approximate 0.7 mile walk to the center. If you are in SF for sightseeing, this is a wonderful location for tourists. The cable car stop is right on Market street, about a block from the hotel. BART is close by and lots of options for bus stops as well. Taxis are very easy to come by. If you like to run, I suggest running along Market street and head down towards the ferry building on Embarcadero. I ran on Embarcadero all the way to Fisherman's wharf and back. The sidewalks are huge and lots of runners in the morning. San Fran is a huge city and there are a lot of homeless people every where. It was a little hard to explain to my child why these people had to live on the streets but then again, it helped her realize how lucky she was. The area around the hotel though is relatively safe. We oftentimes saw police officers patrolling the area on foot at night. We were usually out up until 10 pm and never felt unsafe walking back to our hotel. I would however suggest avoiding the Civic center/Tenderloin area at night. Lots of junkies there...For the shopaholics, tons of high end shops nearby. Macy's is right next door, Neiman Marcus, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany's and Ugg stores are all a block from the hotel. For the coffee addict, do not fear. There is literally a Starbucks in every corner. In fact, there are 2 on the same block the hotel is on. There are also a ton of good restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. It is also a 5-minute walk to the entrance of Chinatown. We ate breakfast at the Grandviews restaurant on the 36th floor every morning. It boasts a magnificent 180 degree view of the city (you can see the Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz from the bar). I highly recommend getting the buffet ($25 per person) as this already includes your drinks (coffee, juice, etc). If you order ala carte, coffee is about $4.50, you might be better off getting your cup of joe from Starbucks. The Golden Gate omelet, one of their specials, was to die for. The fitness center on the 35th floor was well-equipped (about 4 treadmills and 4 ellipticals, weight machines, etc) and the view when you are on the treadmill is exceptional. All in all, I have very little negative things to say about my experience. Staff were very courteous and helpful. We had nothing but excellent customer service during our stay. One negative factor for me though is the internet connection. It is $10 for every 24 hours. In this day and age, you simply just expect that to be part of what you pay for the room. The bathroom also needs to be cleaned a little better. There was some mold on the tile grout in the shower. The only downside about this hotel was the fact that the lobby was under construction. It is a little messy around the elevators. Other than that, the hotel is wonderful and I would gladly recommend it to family and friends.",29-Jun-12,4
"Fabulous room, great view & location. The lobby is currently under construction (June 2012), looks like it'll be nice when it's done.",29-Jun-12,4
"Stayed for 5 nights due to business & booked this hotel primarily due to it's location, so that could also take in some of the sights in San Francisco.Needed a car, so knew that parking was going to be expensive regardless of which hotel I stayed at. Finding the hotel car park was not too easy, due to 2 reasons. First, directions given by hotel doorman (tall blonde guy) were not the best, found him quite ""difficult"" to be honest. Secondly, there was a truck parked in front of the turn-in ! Once you know where it is though it is fine, just around the corner from the hotel front door & the staff there were excellent.As has been said, lobby area is a little bit small at the moment, however it is not terrible and the check-in staff were friendly and efficient. Room allocated was on the 8th floor, upon entering (about 7pm-ish) I was immediately hit with the noise as I walked in, thought I'll need to shut that window, turns out it was shut ! Called down to reception but advised that not possible to change rooms unless I was willing to pay an increase in room rate. Unfortunately I couldn't so ""adjusted"". Room itself though was a good size & very nice, window view could have been better (overlooking buildings directly across the road from front of hotel) above Starbucks. Large LCD TV with enough choice. Very large & comfortable bed, decent lighting. Plenty of storage space. Bathroom was also a good size with a full bath & shower over. Shower was powerful and accurate temperature control. Only moan about the bathroom was the sink, fancy shallow thing which looks great but is difficult to shave in !Had room service on the first night, cost was on a par with what I expected but pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. Did look at the breakfast menu but was put off by the prices, plenty of option within a block.Despite the noise I slept reasonably well every night, bed was really comfortable.Internet is not free, pretty expensive to be honest but the signal strength and speed was good.Have to agree per earlier posts reviews regarding the lifts, they take ages, especially at peak times, plan ahead.Location is good, both for Union Square and heading down to the pier area.Check-out was painless.Would stay here again (on a higher floor), although would maybe try someplace else the next time.",29-Jun-12,3
"I stayed in this hotel while attending a conference. I was first impressed by the enormous lobby! I later found out that tour buses actually stop by this hotel just for tourists to take their pictures here (made me feel special staying in a tourist attaction!). We arrived pretty late but were treated really well - we were given apples and bottles of cold water right there at reception! plus access to Wifi for free for the duration of our stay. Our room overlooked the Bay Bridge, very accessible to all forms of public transportation and walking distance to many sights and restaurants. It was also very convenient to have the car rental in the same hotel when we decided to drive to Monterey, Vallejo and Concord. The cleaning lady was very helpful and nice. We were just disappointed that there was no pool.",29-Jun-12,5
"We stayed here on our honeymoon. Marvin, was the guest services person at the desk. He was very helpful and made us feel very welcome. It is nice to feel that your business is appreciated!The room was clean and had a nice view of the city. There were food options very close to us. The breakfast buffet was pricey bit good. We were told several times to make sure that our car was free of valuables. This gave is a red flag of the area. No problems at all though. We had to pay for internet and parking. This hotel is upscale and we were happy with it.",28-Jun-12,4
"As far as city hotels go , this one is okay. Location is great , easy walking distance to great shopping. Room has all the modern touches and i love the timber foors. Concierge in particular were very very friendly and helpful. We were a little disappointed as they had 2 attempts at getting our advanced paid bayview room check in correct and as we were celebrating our 15 year wedding anniversary I thought they might of acknowledged it with a congratulations but sadly no... Nothing. ",28-Jun-12,4
"The +'s: Rooms are modern, quiet and good sized compared to most metropolitan hotels. The location is close to attractions, BART, shopping, dining, Union Square is VERY nice. The layout of the hotel mostly eliminates the occasional stupidity that goes on in the hallways of large hotels. Staff was OKThe -'s: The lobby (under construction) is about the size of a postage stamp. The elevators are so overloaded during peak times that otherwise sane/rational guests turn ugly. Yesterday we had a middle aged couple literally SHOVE their way into a PACKED elevator because they'd been waiting '30 minutes' already. I was with my family and had my small kids with me, we got the hell out of there and tried the stairs.....since the couple displaced us on the 12th floor we figured it was a reasonable descent.....we were wrong. NONE of the stairwells empty into the lobby, only into restricted constructions areas....so after aruguing with a union constructoin guy we decided we had to go out thru the 'Emergency Exit' (alarm sounded) just to get out of the stairwell. No signs warn of not being able to access the lobby from the stairwells....there were 2 ladies wandering down there that we took under our wing and they walked thru the emergency doors with us. That was not something that should happen....the Management of a hotel needs to THINK LIKE A GUEST and keep folks informed of anything unexpected like this.Another minus, they informed us last night at 8pm that the water to our room would be shut off the next mornign from 10am until 2pm......14 hours notice for a 4 hour utility outage. Now I knew the lobby was under construction before I arrived but I phoned the property and asked if the construction would affect my stay, I was assured it would not.....it SIGNIFICANTLY affected my stay twice.",27-Jun-12,3
"I am a newly minted Hyatt GP Diamond member and made trips to San Francisco over 3 consecutive weeks. The location and ""price was right"" for me at this property, so I gave it a shot. A great find indeed! Very nice rooms, and the upper level Bay-view rooms are great (had one floor 27 or higher 2 of the 3 trips). The rooms are not huge, but are well appointed. RFID roomkeys so you don't have to worry about your mobile phone ""zapping"" the key. Hardwood floors and robes in Grand Club rooms.The Grand Club, its amenities, and most of all, it's friendly staff, is as good as any I've been to, and far better than a lot of them. After the first of my 3 stays, some of the staff started greeting me by name - a nice touch. The view is spectacular! The breakfast provided could actually pass as a BREAKFAST (although the main hot course was similar enough day-to-day that I didn't look forward to it as much toward the end of 13 nights!). The lobby is compressed due to construction, which can be difficult to navigate if there are a lot of people congregating there. They have done a good job (at least during May) to mask the construction, so you just think they have a small lobby that is ""always that way"". The front desk staff at check in/out were great each time as well. Already have another trip planned, this time a combination work/family trip, and will likely make this my first choice on future business trips (walking distance to my employer is 0.8 miles).",27-Jun-12,5
Currently undergoing renovations so no ground floor lobby which is a shame. However the location is pretty unbeatable as long as you don't mind the usual city noises. The 35th floor gym is great for watching the sunrise and the bar on the 36th floor has outstanding views especially for watching the sunset over the bay. Get there early for a window seat. Great concierge service especially grateful for recommendation of Joseph Phelps Winery in Napa. Exceptional wines.,26-Jun-12,4
"Our 4 night stay in May was great! The most comfortable beds we have ever slept in, including our own, staff was very friendly and very helpful. Impressive view from the restaurant/bar on the top floor. Restaurant was abit expensive.Fantastic location, within walking distance to Fishermans Warf, AT&T park and all the shopping you could dream of.",23-Jun-12,5
"I recently stayed here and you really can't beat the location right off of Union Square. Plenty of shopping, walking distance to Chinatown and other areas. Most of the rooms have recently been renovated and they are beautiful - even though i was slightly disappointed that platinum status did not equal a room upgrade. The common areas are still under renovation and that creates a not so welcoming atmosphere in the lobby. For me, in SF, I do not normally plan to spend a lot of time in the hotel, so just give me a nice room and a nice bed in a good location and I am happy. The Hyatt met those needs. I would definitely stay there again. ",22-Jun-12,4
"This was our fourth and last stop on our honeymoon trip to California. We spent five nights at this hotel. When we checked in we learnt that we were booked into a room with two double beds instead of the one King bed we thought we were getting. Could have been our mistake and unfortunately, due to the Golf Open being played in San Francisco at the same time, the hotel was full so they couldn't give us another room. However the beds were super comfortable! We had an 8th floor room at the back of the hotel, unfortunately even 8 floors up the road noise was pretty loud and as there are constant fire engines tearing around the city I suggest you take some earplugs, at first we thought the window must've been open, but nope it was shut! The room itself has been recently refurbished, it's modern and bright. I was quite surprised however that they didn't supply bath robes. Also there is no free WiFi in this hotel, if you want WiFi you have to pay $10 a day! We've stayed at much smaller hotels that have provided free internet access, I think it's a a bit tight of them!The concierge service is helpful, they made some good suggestions for dinner nearby where we ate pretty well. The location is very good as the hotel is right in Union Square and near all transport services. We didn't eat at the hotel but did go up to the top floor bar for a drink, it's worth going up there just for the views!All in all we had a comfortable stay at the this hotel, however due to it's size it does feel very impersonal and I think they could offer a few more thoughtful inclusions for their guests, but it's a very convenient location for a trip to San Francisco.",21-Jun-12,4
"I stayed three nights at this hotel to attend a professional conference. The room was very clean, comfortable and roomy (downright spacious compared to Manhattan hotels). The conference room rate seemed reasonable for a hotel of this fit and finish. The concierge service was extremely helpful in recommending local restaurants and walking tours. I like to walk and from this convenient location I was able to walk through Chinatown up to Coit Tower and back on the first afternoon before dinner.The breakfasts provided at the conference were superb. Fresh fruit, bagels, lox, great coffee.I did not try the hotel restaurant but a few blocks away had a fantastic meal at Cafe Tiramisu - but that, my friends, is for another review.",19-Jun-12,5
"As this was a business stay with most time spent away from the hotel, I can't really comment much other than the idea location to shops in downtown SF and within short walking distance to Union Sq and Chinatown.I did notice that the rooms, no doubt adequately furnished, but could have been better considering that this is a ""Grand Hyatt"". The lobby, which is relatively small for a Grand Hyatt, gets a bit busy during peak hours.",19-Jun-12,3
"Having lived in San Francisco and now travelling there frequently for work, I am very familiar with the city and have stayed in numerous hotels within Union Square as well as the entire bay area. This hotel is an average typical business hotel with all the ammenities one might expect: basic room, clean bathroom (larger than most in SF, as is the case with all Union Square business hotels - Parc 55, Westin, Hilton, etc), restaurant/bar, close to transportation. Whether travelling for business or leisure, the location is perfect. Right in the heart of Union Square and only a short walk to the BART, Chinatown, Muni, etc. I was in SF for business last week and due to the US Open, availabilities were limited so I was booked by my company's corporate travel at the Hyatt as opposed to Parc 55 (my preference for business trips). I had no complaints about the stay other than the fact that the lobby seems to always be packed with people and the hotel charges for wifi. The doorman was awesome and gets a cab for you in record time.I would have easily given this hotel an average to slightly above average score if not for the issues I had during check-out and the week following. I opted to check out at the front desk to ensure that my personal credit card was not charged for the room (the room was pre-paid on a corporate card). I am glad I did this because they were, in fact, charging my personal card rather than charging the corporate card which was on file (I even saw it in the book along with my reservation while sorting this out at the front desk). After 20 minutes of frustration (and now being late to a meeting), the girl at the front desk finally (allegedly) got the situation resolved and gave me a virtually blank piece of paper which was informing me my balance was $0. I was a bit suspicious so I checked my pending transactions on my credit card the following day and sure enough...there was a pending $800 charge from the Hyatt. I immediately called and was transferred to the accounting department. After another 30 minutes of frustration, I was told that it was now officially resolved and my credit card would be credited. 3 days later, I checked my card again. Now the charge was no longer pending but rather, an actual charge AND my statement closing date had occurred so I was getting charged interest on this charge. I called AGAIN and finally was able to get the charge removed however, the interest is still on my statement and I have to file a dispute with the cc company all because the of the Hyatt's incompetence. Overall, this hotel is nothing special (no historical significance like the Sir Francis Drake, not a see and be seen place like the Clift and certainly not the best business hotel out there) but it does the job and is in a good location. The Hyatt clearly need to get a little more organized and not cause their customers days of frustration over a simple 2 night stay. I certainly wouldn't recommend this hotel based on my experiece.",19-Jun-12,2
"Three night stay in this city centre hotel. Friendly and attentive service throughout, especially in the hotel's Grand Views restaurant. Room was spacious, luxuriously appointed and with magnificent views of the city and the Bay beyond. Well equipped and maintained fitness room. In spite of its central location quality sound insulation made for a good night's sleep.",18-Jun-12,5
Hotel was perfectly located on Union Square & very accessible for all transport links & shops/restaurants.Very quite & fabulous views of the city from the bar & restaurant on the 36th floor.Rooms were very spacious with loads of hanging space & a dressing area.Did have to wait around for elevators but not for too long.,17-Jun-12,5
The hotel is located in Union Square and has many eating and shopping options within walking distance. They are renovating the lobby/entrance but it does not cause too much of a disturbance. My room was on the 26th floor so it had wonderful views of the city and bay. The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The food from Room Service was very good. The only downside was that they charge for internet. My opinion is that it should be included in the rate.,17-Jun-12,4
"The hotel in a perfect area, and walking distance to everything. Stayed in the 6th floor and found the room to be a little small but the rooms were very quiet. Comfortable beds and great view from the 36th floor bar. Parking is a little pricey $55 for valet or around $35 for self parking. Personally I though valet was worth it since I didnt have to waste time looking for a parking garage. The lobby was still in construction but most of hotel is complete. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Also, highly recommend Lefty O'doul's breakfast, very good.",16-Jun-12,4
"Outstanding location as it's right next to Union Square. Room was outstanding as well as very modern. Floor to ceiling windows made our room seem twice the size, as did the enormous bathroom and vanity dressing area outside of the closet. Elevators are extremely slow due to the height of the hotel but it's to be expected. Had an issue with room service as well as a double charge but management more than made up for it with Hyatt points credited to my account. Make sure you walk to all your locations in San Francisco as it is extremely walkable and friendly, plus if you are up to it take a jog to the waterfront and watch the Sunrise it is breathtaking.",16-Jun-12,4

"Earlier reviews noted the dilapidated state of the hotel and more recent reviews talked about the construction under way. As several recent reviewers have indicated, the hotel re-model is mostly complete. As of early June, 2012, there was still work being done in the lobby. The rooms are tastefully done in a toned-down modern way. The rooms have small (very small) refrigerators which are nice for cold drinks and a couple of snacks. No microwave but most hotels in this class don't have microwaves. Coffee pot in the room stocked with the standard coffee, powdered cream and 1/8th teaspoon packets of sugar (2 for each cup) (if you use sugar or cream, bring some -- no hotel ever understands that the mini-packets of same don't have enough of either to be of any use.) We didn't take a car -- which was a wise choice since valet is almost more per day than I have to pay for a corporate-rate rent car. Room service and restaurant menus are limited -- and the food is somewhat mediocre. Bread pudding (with whiskey sauce) at 830pm was so dry that it must have been a day or two old. We asked for extra sauce (not really 'extra' since there was none on it when served. Waiter first brought ice cream....we said, no, no, we want whiskey sauce....came back with what appeared and tasted like melted ice cream. As others have noted, the 36th floor bar and restaurant have great views. It was out understanding that the 36th floor would be converted to meeting space (suitable for wedding receptions, etc.) soon. A plus is that the hotel is within a block of 2 diners which serve reasonably price and fairly decent food. Overall, rooms are very nice, the location is great and the service was acceptable. (no pool or spa)",11-Jun-12,4
"Went for the wine tasting and fell in love with San Francisco! The Grand Hyatt is exactly that, GRAND we were luck enough to get a room on the concierge level definitely worth it wonderful breakfast buffett each day appetizers in the early evening as well as desert in the late evening is all part of the concierge level the Grand Hyatt is in a great location you can walk to all of the great shops, Chinatown, and Union Square Park So many things to see and do in San Francisco The hop on hop off tour is great. You can go at your own pace spending more time where you want to and you are not tied to anyone's schedule. We took a wine tour to Sonoma. The tour first made a short stop in Muir Woods. We absolutely loved being able to stop here. We made four stops on the wine tour and that was plenty. Lunch was on our own which was nice. We stopped for pictures at the Golden Gate Bridge on the way back and the pictures were great. Can't wait to go back!",10-Jun-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt is a great location just up Stockton Street from Union Square, putting it within walking distance of tons of restaurants, bars, and stores, and a quick cab ride from most of the things you'd like to do in The City. I understand that all the rooms were renovated in the Fall 2011, so it goes without saying that the room was well furnished and up-to-date. The views from the bar on the 36th Floor are amazing (with Coit Tower, the TransAmerica Building and Alcatraz all visible). The bar staff was a little reserved but the staff at the rest of the hotel were warm and accommodating.The lobby is being renovated until later this year, but it didn't present much of an issue for us. The valet parking fee is $50+ per night, which is shocking for most places but for San Francisco, seems to be the norm.Overall, a great hotel and definitely worth the stay.",10-Jun-12,4

Bar on the 36th floor has the best view of SF I have seen and a lovely place for a light dinner of homemade chicken noodle soup. I would definitely stay here again, a beautiful hotel. Floor to ceiling windows made my room seem twice the size, as did the HUGE bathroom and vanity dressing area outside of the closet. Ask for a room on a high floor, I lucked out and ended up on 32nd floor with a view of bay. Staff was exceptionally nice. Lobby was still under renovation, but that didn't matter.",9-Jun-12,5

On Friday, June 1,I called for my car to drive to the meeting and was shocked to find that the car had beenramsacked. No signs of forced entry. City Parking which runs the valet service for Hyatt had the key. Lost business items and my registration.

The rooms have been recently renovated and have the sleek, modern, new ""Hyatt look"". The lobby is pretty much sealed off due to ongoing renovations, except for asmall area for check-in. I am sure it will be beautiful when its done. Staff very friendly and helpful and gave us complimentary late checkout. Large bathroom. The beds are comfortable and room was very quiet. Had great night of sleep! Walk to Union square, Westfield Mall, theaters and lots of restaurants in the area. Cable car stop also very closeby. There is a parking garage (valet) across the street on Sutter that offers a hotel parking special, and you are charged thru the hotel. Even though it is not the ""official"" parking garage for Hyatt, It can't be any closer to the hotel and it probably costs a lot less.",4-Jun-12,4
"The room was very clean due to the recent renovations, but on the small side and poorly designed. There was very little drawer space, the bathroom sink (though nice and modern) took up most of the counter, you had to stand practically against the shower wall to get under the shower head, and the scent of the bath products was horrible. We kept joking that we were on a cruise ship because of the size of the room and the creaking noise (evidently caused by the building swaying in the wind) that woke us up during the night.  The housekeeping staff were excellent as well as the people who delivered room service and the doorman. I wish I could say the same for the front desk staff. They were not rude, but in no way were they friendly or welcoming.  The cleanliness of the room and the location made it a pleasant stay and the price was great too so I would possibly stay here again.",3-Jun-12,3
"Stayed with my sister May 26 to May 31 in a Grand Club room (2 doubles) on the 31st floor. Our view was outstanding and even though we both will never see 55 again, we enjoyed playing with the electronic shades. ;)The lobby is â€“ temporarily â€“ very small as this Hyatt undergoes a final renovation to make the lobby what it should be and the restaurant is moved to a ground level location. Nevertheless, that should not deter you from staying here - the location, beautiful rooms, guest services and friendliness of the Hyatt staff are worth passing through the small lobby area.Grand Hyatt Staff were attentive - the bellstaff were prompt and helpful. We spent a fair bit of time in the Grand Club Lounge on the 32nd floor (amazing views) and the Lounge Staff â€“ all of them - (special mention to Kyle) were attentive and prompt in keeping such a lovely lounge in A1 condition.Also, a very special mention about David (Dave) in the Grand Club Lounge â€“ Dave was not only very friendly and personable, but provided consistent good service. Dave went out of his way to get me hummus dip for my cruditÃ©s (can't eat wheat - a component of many dips).  The days that we were there, the Lounge was open for Continental Breakfast from 5:30 to 9:30am M-F and from 7 to 10am on weekends (baked pastries, fruit, hot dish- example frittatas). Hors dâ€™oeuvres are from 5 to 7pm and dessert until 9pm nightly. The upgrade to Grand Club Lounge Service is worth it for the staff, the food and the views.This was our first stay in a hotel room with hardwood floors (small area rug). Overall, the room was very nice (as many have stated here) and came with single cup coffee maker (look on the shelf under the safe) small fridge, bathrobes, and very nice bathroom amenities.While there was a minor design flaw or two in the room, a major design flaw are only 2 hooks in the bathroom to hang things up! This conflicts with the wishes of the Hyatt and their guests to conserve resources by re-using towels. How do you re-use towels when you - for example -must layer your bath towel onto your damp hand towel? And unless you are a very tall or agile person, forget about hanging your towel over the shower curtain rod â€“ it's too high. Hopefully after the renovation is finished, Hyatt will turn their attention to addressing this deficiency. We had a very pleasant few days looking at the sights in San Francisco and we looked forward to returning to our room each day. Would definitely consider staying here again if in San Francisco.",3-Jun-12,5
Location is great to see the city. Easy to get a cab or catch a bus.Rooms were clean and standard. Upstairs bar offers a nice view and live music. Staff was friendly and helpful.Wish I had a coffee maker in the room and wireless Internet wasn't so expensive and spotty. I also found it odd that there was no fan in the bathroom. Most of these things I'd expect from a large hotel chain so may look at others in area before staying here again.,2-Jun-12,4
"Stayed here over the Memorial Day weekend May 2012 and had a great time. This hotel is only 1/2 block from Union Square, easy access to shopping, restaurants, cable car, MUNI & BART. Second time staying here. Certainly will return.",2-Jun-12,5
"I arrived late and was greeted by a panhandler - not the best beginning to my stay. I think a better run hotel would have either bribed the panhandler to go elsewhere, or at the very least, had the doorman/porter observant enough to greet me as I exited the taxi, as opposed to after I had checked in. The room was as others have described it - slick and modern - and had just about everything you could ask for. My only issue with the room was that the television reception was pretty fuzzy for a couple of the network stations (NBC and I think CBS). I know this can be an issue in a city, but I would have enjoyed my early morning routine with less static on the TV. Speaking of mornings, one morning there were 2 elevators out of service. After waiting for 20 minutes, and I'm not exagerating, I decided that I would have to walk down, rather than risk being late for my customer meeting. Fortunately, I was only on the 7th floor. I lugged my laptop down a couple of flights, only to be greeted by guests and a hotel employee heading back up. It seems we had all chosen the staircase to no where, and had to get to a floor with the correct access, and then were guided to the basement, and finally to an exit. Kudos for the employee, who did lug my laptop for me.Normally, I wouldn't even mention this last point, but I think it is indicative of the lack of attention paid to details. That was the erratic nature of newpaper delivery. One morning, the Wall Street Journal was outside my door. The next three mornings, no paper at my door, but copies of the San Francisco Chronicle near the elevator. The last morning, USA outside my door. As I say, this was no big deal, but highlights a lack of consistency in the hotel.",1-Jun-12,3
"Our stay was very pleasant. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. And, yes, the view from the 36th floor is amazing! The location was central and made it easy to get to the sights. We were attending a wedding and the view was a bonus. The other hotels we stayed in on this extended trip included a continental breakfast and cost less. I do feel something could have been included in the cost. Also, the coffee machine was well hidden and not discovered until our 2nd night. I would like to make a suggestion - we wanted to reuse our towels to save on the environment, but there were no towel racks in the room to hang them to dry.",31-May-12,5
"Friendly staff and easy check-in. Parking was very expensive - after taxes, the valet parking cost $54/day. Self-parking would have been slightly cheaper - by about $5 I think. Good location - easy to walk to my meetings. Wi-fi was included with the room - though the desk chair was way too low to be able to work comfortably with a laptop at the desk in the room. The room quickly got stuffy after I used the shower. Even though I had the A/C turned on, it would have been nice to be able to open a window or turn on a fan in the bathroom. I ate supper at the bar on the 36th floor. Friendly service. Not many food choices on the bar menu, especially if you wanted to try to have something healthy. Room service breakfast was pricey but quite good and delivered very quickly. Actually, one of the best room service meals I've had in a long time.",31-May-12,4
"Overall great hotel.We considered this hotel because of its location in Union Square, which area itself has a lot to offer for tourists, accessible to almost everything - malls, cable cars, chinatown, stores, etc.Walking distance to public transport, the Muni and BART so getting to other parts of SF is no big problem.Staff are nice, room is clean, almost complete things one need in a hotel.Downside are the mattresses which are not that comfortable as I found it a bit too soft.Also wi-fi isn't free and it costs $10 for a 24-hour internet service.",31-May-12,5
"The Grand Hyatt offers sensational value for money. The location is superb and most of the highlights are a hop and a skip away.We've stayed at other hotels around Union Square and this is the quietest and also the most modern.Beds are really comfortable, my only recommendation is if you are a light sleeper, request for a room on the higher floors as the city itself never sleeps.",28-May-12,4
"I would like to preface this trip report by saying The Grand Hyatt San Francisco is one of the best hotels I have stayrd at in regards to recognition for Hyatt Gold Passport Diamond members. Properties such as the GHSF make me happy that I have chosen to be loyal to Hyatt.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just completed a stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francicisco and I have nothing but compliments for the way the staff handled our special needs during this trip.This was the first time traveling for my friend since she had a stroke a year ago.She has limited mobility now and requires an ADA room. I wanted to be close to here so we asked for an ADA room with and adjoining room for me.This was handled well by the Grand Hyatt San Francisco(I contacted them directly and they were very helpful)and I was sent an email confirmation listing my requests.There was some confusion with the reservation(which was caused by a third party calling to confirm our reservation)which had us in three rooms instead of two. This was taken care of with no trouble by the FDR with the third ""phantom room ""taken off the reservation with no problem.Our first room was on the 6th floor was exactly the set up requested. However it was very noisy so I asked to be moved. The hotel was full so I was told they would move us the next day to a higher floor=which they did.The second set of rooms did not have a roll in shower but Housekeeping brought up a bath bench which worked out pretty well. Both rooms were very clean and I really enjoyed the new bed in my room. It was much quieter.There is construction(new MUNI station) in the Union Square area that starts at 6 a.m. so the noise/road detours is going to be a problem for all the hotels in that areaA couple of standout staff members made our stay wonderful. First of was a Bellman named Hal. His kindness and consideration were remarkable. All the bellman and Valet staff were great but Hal went above and beyond and his help was much appriciated.Dave in the Grand Club makes all of the guests feel like returning friends.All of the staff members in the Grand Club are pretty great. One of the best I have been to in the USA.I am forwarding this to The General Manager of the Grand Hyatt San Francisco via Facebook with the hope that the staff memebers mentioned (as well as the entire staff)are commended for their great work.And to thank the hotel for helping to make a challenging stay comfortable.",28-May-12,4
"The hotel's location is central and makes it very accessible to explore downtown San Francisco.We spent 4 nights here and were very impressed by the cleanliness of the rooms as well as the modern feel. Breakfast buffet is great - however, the service on the other hand was a little bias towards older guests and did not tend to us more than once. We pay the same price or maybe more so we expect the same service and treatment from the staff.The concierge's tips on which restaurants to go to and what to see were spot on. Overall, we can only recommend staying here!",28-May-12,4
"This is a modern high-rise high-quality hotel. Location is excellent being right off Union Square and central to a lot of what San Francisco has to offer. Reception, concierge and restaurant staff were all polite and friendly.The rooms are recently refurbished and I had a bayview room on the 29th Floor. Great to open the electronically-operated blind in the mornings and take in the San Francisco bay view! The bed was great, the bathroom tasteful, the flatscreen TV new and modern.Breakfast buffet was good. Quality food, but not outstanding. The view from the 36th floor was spectacular however.Any gripes? Well the lobby is somewhat minimalist. Nowhere much to sit and wait for friends/colleagues. Also paying for wi-fi in a high-end establishment does grate on me. Seriously folks, it's time to realise that in a high-end hotel like the Grand Hyatt, wi-fi is not an add-on luxury but should be a complimentary essential.",28-May-12,4
"Centrally located in Union Square. Very accessible by cab or bart (metro). The lobby is under refurbishment, there is just a small area for guest reception. The room was ok, clean and with a beautiful view over downtown San Francisco. The thing I did not appreciate was wi-fi connection. It was not for free (10 dollars/day) and overall slow and unstable. Nevertheless, this remains a good hotel. ",27-May-12,4
"I tend to avoid the big chain hotels as too impersonal, too cardboard-y, and too predictable. But I go to SF regularly for work and have to follow the rates my corporate site gives (the same room in SF can vary $400-500/night depending on what is going on in town that week). That led me to the Hyatt, which has a very convenient location, but has very little ""curb appeal"". The lobby and street level entrance is dark, small, and generally depressing, and gives a terrible first impression. But once you leave the lobby, the rest of the hotel is much better. The rooms are light, modern, well designed, and very pleasant, and I would happily stay in them again. The bar on the top floor is easily overlooked, but the views are fabulous (though the decor is dated and out-of-synch with the modern decor in the guest rooms), and it was a very pleasant spot. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and I might return, but will say that mgmt keeps the nice details of this hotel well hidden, and its hard to ignore those important first impressions that made me question whether this choice.",23-May-12,4
"Hi there -- Would love some tripadvisor feedback. I'm staying there over memorial day weekend and booked a package that supposedly includes a few things, including breakfast -- however every time I call I get a different answer about what is included or not in the breakfast, what type of room I'm getting, and the last two times I was hung up on -- accidentally I know, but still a bit annoying! Should I be scared to stay here? It's my anniversarry weekend, so I'm hoping it will be very nice, but I'm now nervous. When I told the front desk it was my anniversary their first response was that they could sell me a higher floor room -- I know that it is their job to sell, but it felt not too welcoming. So, should I be nervous or excited about staying here?",22-May-12,4
"On the corner of union square but no cable car noiseCheck in and out were fast and easy with friendly helpful staffThe room was large for a city hotel with plenty of room and extra furniture like a comfortable lounge chair and a dest with plugs. Nice bathroom. Good temperature control. Very clean.Nice interesting walk to the convention center, top of knob hill, china town, embark aero, theater district.",22-May-12,4
I am not handicapped but was in room 2117 which is an ADA room. The hotel appears to have gone under recent renovation. The room was clean comfortable and had ample room for anyone with a disability. The light switches were low set as was the closet rod for easy reach. Desk and bath counter would Accomodate a wheelchair. There was a regular bathtub shower combo so this would not accomorate easy wheelchair access. But it did have security railsBeautiful view but since had an adjoining room I could hear neighbors conversations if in a moderately loud voice. Convenient to downtown and Chinatown but a walk to the convention center. All staff helpful. Lobby not impressive and was very busy. Overall a good experience,22-May-12,4
"We were pleasantly surprised by the rooms at the Grand Hyatt in SF. The lobby is undergoing renovations, so much of it is blocked off, however, our room was completely renovated in a tastefully modern but warm decor. The floor to ceiling windows give you an impressive view of the cityscape. I was very glad that I requested a high floor. The remote controlled shades were a nice touch too.The Union Sq. location was ideal for most of the popular attractions. We did not rent a car so the cable cars, cabs, buses and street cars were our main forms of transportation. The cable cars and street cars were a very pleasant and nostalgic way to travel the hilly streets of San Francisco. The Grandview Bar and restaurant boasts one of the best views of the city.The sevice was exceptional, from housekeeping to room service. The one complaint is they did not have a business center during my stay. Guests only have access to one public computer that has a $6 charge for every 15 minutes of internet connection. So for the price, the Grand Hyatt SF was a pleasant experience. The central location, the chic rooms, and the freindly service all contributed to a great trip!",20-May-12,4
"I usually stay at the Grand Hyatt when I'm in San Francisco. It's location is great, just one block from Union Square, but the rooms overlook the square itself. The rooms are good size and their recent renovation has improved the hotel. One of the best parts of the hotel is their restaurant/bar, which is on the 36th floor and gives you a wonderful view of the city. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I've never been to the breakfast buffet, but have ordered room service for breakfast many times. Food is good and they are generally quick to bring it up. You won't go wrong staying at the Grand Hyatt.",19-May-12,4
"Location is great. Room is not so great or clean. I had to clean bathroom again, hair all over the place. Layout, vibe, comfort levelnot like other Hyatts I go to. And I can't believe a Hyatt makes you stand in a corner to use a computer, and they only have one! Many other hotels to choose from, skip this one.",19-May-12,3
"Great location on the nicer side of Union Square, had room on a high floor with a great view. Room was modern and nicely furnished. Lobby was being refurbished but they've done a great job at the temporary setup - you could easily not notice anything was going on.",18-May-12,5
"You will not go wrong here. It is close to Union Square, walking distance from many stores, nice restaurants and a good mall. Service is good, the concierge very friendly and helpful.",17-May-12,4
"I have stayed at Gran Hyatt a few times in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Those stays were amazing. I wish I could say the same about the Grand Hyatt San Francisco.Unfortunately what was wrong with the hotel is not a short list.1. Hotel rooms have no furniture for clothing that is folded. There is only one small closet with one shelf2. The bathroom is large but poorly designed. The towel hooks\bars are 10 feet away from the shower3. My toilet leaked every time it was flushed and was never fixed4. The breakfast buffet is very poor - $25 and all they have is scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, fruit, and bread. No omelet station, no one cooking at a griddle station, ECT. The food they did have was very poorFor a hotel that charges over $300 a night this is very poor service and hotel. I paid muss less and got much better accommodations in AsiaI would avoid this hotel.",16-May-12,1
"We spent 5 nights here 9th-13th May and had a great trip. The location is excellent, the staff were great, and the room was roomy with a nice bathroom and shower and the most comfortable king bed ever! We were sad to leave. The breakfast we ordered one day was great and even arrived a little early. I'd stay here again.",16-May-12,5
"We stayed at the Hyatt for a week at the beginning of May. The location is unbeatable, right in the centre of town. The lobby is a little old-fashioned but the bedrooms are clean and modern with a great view.The amenities in the bedrooms were not amazing, no showercap or slippers, which i normally expect, but the staff was superb. I have to thank Susan again for making sure my mum got a treat for her birthday, she will never forget that.Parking is expensive but concierge was lovely and told us about cheaper alternatives nearby.All in all a great experience, I love Hyatts and I was not disappointed, will definitely stay there again when in SF.",15-May-12,4
"Normally, I don't like to book a room through Priceline as I have had less than positive experiences in the past, but since we needed two rooms we decided to risk it. I was pleasantly surprised as I was quite worried with what we would end up with. The room had a stylish modern design. We didn't have much of a view although my daughter did, so at least some of us had a good view. There is a small refrigerator, a safe and a coffeepot with packets of coffee all inside the cabinets near the desk. However, you have to look in the closet to find a place to put your clothes. The dresser is in the closet. There is a button by the bed that automatically opens the blinds--very cool. There are reading lights by the bed that can be rather annoying as they hang right in your face. They can be bent out of the way without damage. I was afraid I might break them at first. The bathroom is also very modern. The large mirror with the light all around it was an interesting design. I have seen it in a Westin before and I like it. The sink is like a giant trough. I liked the design of the bathroom. Be careful with the pocket door as it can slam shut pretty easily. My daughter's boyfriend got his finger smashed in the door. He was alright but it hurt so be aware and close it slowly.I was worried we might have excessive noise because we were near the housekeeping supply closet, but it wasn't an issue. The hotel appears to be well insulated so there were no noise problems. We had requested a king bed but weren't able to get it but two queens worked out fine. If this was one of their lower end rooms, which I am assuming it was because we used Priceline, I can just imagine what the more expensive rooms are like.We went to the 36th floor where they have a bar with a panaramic view of the city. That was definitely worth doing. The Grand Hyatt is located right in Union Square so it's an easy walk to lots of shopping. We had gone to a concert and got back late so we were looking for food. We went to a diner nearby called Lori's Diner. I don't recommend it. Bad service and even worse food. The only positive I can say about the place is it is open really late at night. Find someplace else to go.Overall, I had a very pleasant stay and would come back to the Grand Hyatt the next time I decide to stay in San Francisco.",14-May-12,4
"I go to San Francisco really often for work or leisure reasons and this time I wanted to make an hotel change. Before I went to Mandarin Oriental and then Westin St. Francis, both wonderful hotels but, this time, I've been really surprised by Grand Hyatt San Francisco. Starting from the hotel staff, helpful, kind and so professional. Anne S. and Oscar L. tks a lot for your warm welcome. The hotel is totally renewed, the rooms are amazing and the beds really comfortable. I had a room at the 28th floor and the view of the city skyline from my full-size window was stunning. The hotel is located in the best position in SF, near all the city tourist attractions or financial district if you're there for business. I'll be back! this is my new choice because... I left my heart in San Francisco and Grand Hyatt helped me on that.",13-May-12,5
"An excellent hotel, very impressive and very accesable. Staff are friendly and facilites are brilliant. In the middle of downtown San Fran. Really made my visit brilliant!! I would reccomend this hotel to anyone visiting San Fran. Rooms are lovely and quite big. A grat place to stay!!",13-May-12,5
Very Convenient Location on Union Square.Nicely Renovated.Modern and Cozy.Surrounding Area surprisingly dark and quiet at night.Service could improve.They only give 200 Gold Passport points per stay??,13-May-12,4
"I am just finishing up my stay at the Grand Hyatt and was very impressed with the rooms, the food and the exceptional service. The rooms appear to be recently renovated and are very well appointed for the business (or any) traveler. Some of the points that were a highlight:* Wireless access was very reasonably priced.* The remote controls for the shades and nightlights by the bed were a nice touch.* The toiletries were high quality and the addition of toothpaste was a nice touch.* Bed and furniture incredibly comfortable.* Great lighting* Wonderful shower with modern fixtures.* Very nice gym on the 35th floor - great views!The staff was exceptional. Every one greeted you and struck up a conversation on the elevator. One morning I was headed back to the room and my key no longer worked. I went downstairs but I didn't have a picture ID. They would NOT just give me a key, which is exactly what should have happened. Instead, the sent someone upstairs with me and kindly asked me to show my ID. That makes me feel very safe as a woman traveling alone.Finally, I had room service a couple of nights and the phone was excellent.This will be my destination of choice in SF for business or pleasure.",10-May-12,5
"We stayed at Grand Hyatt San Francisco for three nights in April. And it was the full right decision.I did not found anything wrong, quite the contrary: ubication is perfect, touching Union Square, the place that can be considered the middle of the downtown; it is full of restaurants and there are plenty of shops nearby, such as Apple Store, Macy's, Oakley, and so on. Starbucks opposite.If you arrive driving, one option is valet parking (about 50$), or public car parks in Union Square.Taxi to Pier 33 (Alcatraz) or Pier 39 is about 10$.Reception: check-in and check-out very fast (I appreciate it so much), and staff very pleasant and always with a smile for us.Concierge service: excellent, all doubts and bookings we asked for were perfect, and their recommendations about restaurants were exactly what we were looking for.Rooms: do not hesitate and book a bay view room. Worth it absolutely. Located at the highest floors, an amazing view is offered from the room; in addition, blinds are automatic, so you can wake up in the morning opening the blinds from your bed and enjoy that dramatic scenery. Large rooms and with high quality furniture. Cleanliness is a highlight.We read some wrong reviews about the wifi signal. All we have to say is that we had a perfect wifi signal from reception to our room, and also in the Level 36 restaurant (highly recommended too, to have dinner or just to have a cocktail).I would emphasize specially on the kindness and efficiency of all the staff in the hotel. They convert our stay in San Francisco from good to excellent.Of course, when we come back again to San Francisco we will book this accommodation. Is one of the best hotels I have ever been.",10-May-12,5
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights in April (22nd-27th) we were on the 19th floor which was lovely for views of the city and kept the noise out from the busy road. The room itself was lovely with everything you would expect. It was clean and well presented. The bed was amazingly comftable which made it very hard to get up in the morning. The staff were very helpful and the system which allows you to pre book back onto your flight home was great. The hotel was also in a fantastic location right next to Union Square! Very central. I would have no problems in recommeding this hotel to friends and family. Nice hotel in a great city!,10-May-12,5
"My husband and I used a suite upgrade and, for the bargain price of just $199 a night in San Francisco, were given a very pleasant suite with a small living room and bedroom. Views from the high floor were beautiful over the city. The room was very clean and looked like it had just been redone. The bed was a typical, comfortable Hyatt bed. Housekeeping was always very efficient however, avoid the corner rooms because you will be woken up early in the morning as that is also where housekeeping has their supply closets. Public transportation is all around you and the tour bus companies all pick you up in Union Square. Go to the concierge for suggestions. One in particular was wonderful, I believe her name was Liz. She suggested a small tour company for a day long trip to the wine country. It was absolutely wonderful and with only 10 people in the small bus, everything was much more enjoyable. It also picked you up and dropped you off right at the hotel. I would have given this hotel a five had the club lounge had more of a selection in the evening. Breakfast was okay, nothing special but adequate albeit overcrowded. No real snacks offered during the day, a cash bar, and missing staff who couldn't answer any questions. Make sure to visit Alcatraz and book your tickets in advance if you are going during the busy season.",8-May-12,4
"We stayed at this hotel in April 2012 for 3 nights. The location is perfect for access to tourist spots. Hop on/hop off bus leaves from Union Square. Plenty of great shops and restaurants within walking distance. Starbucks across the road. Our room was spacious and had everything we needed. We had a great view of union square from our floor to ceiling window.  One complaint was that it was very dusty. I actually had to dust the bedside table myself so I didn't sneeze all night!. Apart from that, the room was clean, bed comfortable and we were happy.Gym was good, great view while working out.There is a couple of laundries nearby that wash, dry and fold your clothes for $1 per pound.Internet was reasonably priced for a hotel.I would definately stay here again if returning to SF.",8-May-12,5
"I stayed here four nights on a business trip. The Grand Hyatt is an old war horse of a hotel -- it's been around for decades now. This was my first stay. The lobby is not much more than the reception desks and then turn the corner to the banks of elevators. It makes it efficient because you won't run into families or folks milling around in a typical tourist lobby area. But if you want the grand, welcoming lobby experience -- you won't find it here. The banks of elevators are a godsend because the wait is short. I stayed in a standard king bedroom. The room was modernized and had more than enough space at about 300 sq ft. The bed was comfortable with clean, soft linens. There's a large flat screen TV. The window shades are electronic which is wonderful when one is too lazy to get up off the bed to close them. The bathroom had enough space to manuveur around without feeling claustophobic. There were high quality toiletries in use -- a great touch was the small tube of toothpaste that lasted all week.One thing to note: I had one of those rooms that had a door which connected to the adjacent room. There wasn't much soundproofing on the connecting door because I could hear my neighbors when I stood in front of the mirror at the side of the connecting door.",7-May-12,4
"There is nothing bad to say about this hotel! The rooms were gorgeous, staff friendly and helpful, and the location is perfect. The BART is very close, cable car stop close, and all the tour buses stop at Union Square which is right across the street. You can walk to China town and there are tons of restaurants you can walk to as well.",7-May-12,5
"Grand Hyatt was a Priceline win bid, based specially in the strategic location of Union Square, and that is the first good thing about it: it is located just steps away from the square. The hotel has partially attended my requests, since they have assined us adjoining rooms(four persons, two rooms), but not a special view, what I had asked informing them it was a special occasion. The view from our rooms in a lower to medium height floor facing the city was not bad, but not special. To have a nice view we went one morning to the restaurant on the top floor for breakfast, which was average in quality for the price. The rooms and bathroom are very clean, comfortable, with a nice size and decor. The lobby is small and bland, though. Value overall was great for us.",7-May-12,4
"We arrived at the hotel after a long flight and were given access to our room early. Our room was on the 12th floor and had a great view of Union Square. The room was on the larger side with plenty of room for two suitcases. The bathroom is also quite large and has recently been updated. The room was clean, however, I did find a hair on one pillow.The location is perfect for the shopping and dining options in Union Square.The doorman/bellman (the morning shift) was the best employee we encountered at this hotel. He was conversational without being annoying and got everyone on their way quickly and efficiently.Unfortunately, that's the end of the good points about this hotel. The front office staff were rude on our checkout. We asked for some further information about their conference facilities and we instructed to look it up ourselves online. What, you can't give the slightest bit of information verbally?The room service was not up to scratch. The first night they forgot the OJ (but still charged me) and the second night they forgot the cheese on the burger!The wifi (that you have to pay for) is very slow. I could only pick up two bars in my room and it would constantly drop out. Not very good for a business hotel.Lastly, they charged my credit card without my authorization a day before I checked out. I wanted to discuss the Internet charges considering I couldn't get a signal half the time and shouldn't have to pay but I didn't get the chance since they already charged me. Not cool.",4-May-12,3
"We stayed here last weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located very centrally. Shopping / Dining / Transit ...everything very close. We had great views from our room on the 30th floor.Only some rooms will have the view of the Golden gate bridge (we did not). However, many rooms on the higher floors will definitely have amazing views!We ate breakfast at Grandviews restaurant every day of our stay. We totally enjoyed the banana pancakes!!More than the pancakes...was the view from the restaurant....literally 360 degree view of the entire area!! We got great pictures!!On our departure day, we had a small misunderstanding about breakfast. But, the front desk staff went above and beyond and made sure we got our breakfast (since we had an early flight). The restaurant manager was already organized with what we wanted to eat. There was just a little miscommunication. We were happy it was sorted out quickly.We noticed a lot of families with kids (all ages) staying in this hotel. Also, we had one night where there was a noise problem from the next door room. This was solved by hotel security within ten minutes after calling the front desk. OVerall ..highly recommend this hotel if it is in your budget!I suggest getting the breakfast package. You will not regret it!!",4-May-12,4
"Take a peek on Hyatt's website for their Hyatt Free Time Special. Stay 2 nights and get one free with daily breakfast for two. It's a deal that can't be beat and i know! (i booked on expedia for a different property only to cancel for the Hyatt through Hotel Planner only to cancel AGAIN for a better deal direct through the Hyatt website)Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Grand Hyatt. My boyfriend and I arrived at OAK and took the BART to the Powell Street station. The walk to the Grand Hyatt was a bit confusing for a SF first-timer due to the construction on the roads & Powell St station. Once we arrived, check-in was a breeze. The construction in the lobby area was unnoticeable. We were able to check-in early at around 2pm and were given a room on the 14th floor. The view wasn't great..but a room is a room and we were only there to sleep. Room Pros:- decor is lovely- modern, bright spacious room- sun blocking blinds - hdmi capabilities on the TV- reading lights that were adjustable on both sides of the beds in addition to the normal bedside table lamps- real fridge (instead of the mini bar ones that keep things cool but not cold) for our leftovers & drinks- magnifying mirror (i packed my own but this one was great!) i was tempted to ask where i could get one for home!- massive sink (i mean 3x the size of a standard bathroom)- glass table top in the bathroom (perfect for placing your hot hair tools without wrecking the counters)-4+ elevators (the wait was never long)Room Cons:- lack of drawer space in the closet (3 tiny tiny drawers)- not enough places to put your towels, there were a couple of hooks for your bath towels but no where to put your face/hand towelsBreakfast was held daily in their restaurant on the 36th floor. The view is to die for! Picturesque view of Coit Tower and the city. Try to go for breakfast early to guarantee one of the window views! I really enjoyed the options for breakfast: Full Breakfast Buffet or order off the menu (Most hotels only offer a breakfast buffet). The buffet had a wide variety of options and you were also able to order hot pancakes or waffles if you wanted them. Service was professional and friendly.One thing i have to comment on is that there were always staff readily available to assist you. You never had to look around for help. And thank you to the Concierge that stayed open a little longer than normal to arrange our shuttle service to the airport. The hotel also offers complimentary boarding pass print outs through the computers in the front desk area. Thanks for the wonderful stay! I will definitely think of the Grand Hyatt for future visits to San Francisco!",3-May-12,5
"Great location, union square!!! Walking distance to all of the downtown sites like chinatown, market st and ect. The hotel is updated, clean and great service. My first choice for San Francisco!!! ",1-May-12,5
Three night stay. Approx $200 per night. Noisy location. Only one Resturant on 36th floor with very poor staff and very expensive breakfast. No proper lobby to sit and have a coffee or snack. Many rooms have interconnecting doors which mean you need quiet neighbours if you need sleep following long distance flight.,28-Apr-12,3
"Great location, and the rooms are generally clean. During my last three stays however the staff were on strike. This was unpleasant, and there were demonstrations, leaflets left in the room, and the service was much delayed. Generally the staff is rather rude. On one occasion the porter smashed my luggage (most likely an accident), breaking a toy a bought for my son. This was annoying, as I have just checked out and was heading to the airport. When you call on the phone them many times they just hang up :( The aircon is very loud, and you can smell cigaret smoke many times :(Otherwise, it is an OK hotel. I really like its location.",28-Apr-12,2
"We are a family of 5 and stayed for 3 nights in April in interconnecting rooms. Overall the hotel was great. The staff were friendly and attentive, the rooms were good and the beds comfortable. There were a number of things that could have been done better, which I have described below but, if you don't have time to read the rest, our overall summary is that this is a good hotel in a great location.Having booked online a month in advance, with a confirmed reservation for rooms on the 20th floor or above, we didn't get off to a very good start on arrival. We were told that the only interconnecting rooms were on the 4th floor. In the rooms we found ourselves staring at the windows of the building opposite and decided to complain. The staff then 'discovered' they had interconnecting rooms on the 19th floor, not quite what we had booked, but a great view of Union Square. There are extensive overnight roadworks going on in Union Square at present, and the thin glazing on the windows allowed this work, and the traffic noise, to become quite intrusive, although we soon adjusted.The rooms are newly refurbished, and although the furniture and decorations are not lavish, they are smart, neat and largely functional. Little things could be improved, like the fact that the room is provided with an ice bucket, ice tongs, a bottle opener, but no glasses! The kids were upset that their tastes were not catered for in the choice of TV channels delievered free to the room but again, these are minor complaints.If you have a car, use the assisted parking at the garage across the street to save yourself valet charges. The restaurant on the 36th floor has fantastic views, the food is very good, and the waiting staff are friendly and helpful. We had a small problem with an undercooked dish, but were given a complimentary desert, which was very generous.We would stay at this hotel again and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",27-Apr-12,4
"If you want to experience everything that this city has to offer, there is no better hotel to stay at.The service is impeccable, the rates are great, and the views from the top floor bar are to die for.",27-Apr-12,5
"Stayed 3 nights for work. Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. (ex - called to get # for aiport shuttle - they offered to book it for me). My room was nice and bed was comfortable. Nice touch was little reading lights hooked to side of the bed - this was great since I spent most of my trip reading documents in my room (try to contain your jealousy over my exciting trip). My only complaint is same as a couple others - the lobby is currently under construction and it is NOISY! I was only on the 7th floor - may get better as you go up. But the construction started early and went on pretty late. Also, I am guessing due to construction there weren't any real quiet places to meet and talk with co-workers which would have been nice. That said - this was one of my better stays in SF.Also - although it is pretty pricey - the view from the restaurant/bar at the top is spectacular. Treat yourself to a cocktail at a table by the window.",26-Apr-12,4
"We love this hotel and always stays there. This is the first time we have this problem. Great room on the 20th floor, facing the bay and Coit Tower. We were there for six nights. Had 4 sets of neighbors in adjoining room, two of these were incredibly loud and it was like they were in our room. All the noise came through the door between our rooms.First set of neighbors (1 night only), had loud, I mean top of lungs, arguments... first mid afternoon, with the women accusing of all kinds of things and speaking loudly, half crying, non-stop talk. Then around 1:30 in the morning it started again, woke us, this time both were arguing. The man kept saying he was leaving - I wish !-, then they started insulting each other with the F. word. It went on for 45 minutes. I finally called the Front Desk, but the arguing was intermittent, with sometimes 5 minutes of quiet, and Security missed it. They said they could not call or knock unless they hear something... Next day was calm with new neighbors. Then the two next nights, we had a young couple with a little girl. They were wild, playing for hours, running after each other, screaming and laughing. It is nice that they were happy, but again, we heard everything... It started again at night till past 11PM. Wow, impossible to sleep wondering if it was going to start again.. they were there two days.It has never happened to us before. The soundproofing between the rooms is non existent, totally inappropriate for a hotel of this quality. Now, we wonder if we will stay there again, because it really affected our enjoyment of the trip. Relaxing and sleeping well is part of a vacation. (they told us all rooms, but one per floor, had adjoining door)",26-Apr-12,4
"We stayed there for a total of 3 nights and had a really enjoyable stay. The lobby was being renovated so there's not much seating place or anything really to look at.The rooms however were really well kept and clean, which is definitely more than I could say for some hotels we've stayed at recently.The pros:1. Room is clean and newly decorated.2. Location is very centralized, easy to get around Union Square area by foot.3. Staff is very helpful and courteous. From the front desk, bell, valet, room service.4. Starbucks right across the street and walgreens a block away. Easy to get to by foot for water, snacks, etc.5. Mini fridge in the hotel room... very nice.The cons:1. There's no lock on the bathroom door! What's up with that?2. There's only 1 way to get to this hotel by car... make sure you learn the map of the area or you'll be doing run arounds like we did the first couple of times.3. Parking is not cheap... then again what do you expect in SF Union Sq area.I definitely would stay here again no qualms about it.",25-Apr-12,4
"Overall, the hotel was very good. Clean, comfy beds. What got to me was that the lobby is being remodeled and the rennovations can be quite loud. So the guy at the front desk puts me in a room on the third floor, so I can get as close to the construction noise as possible. I truly wondered what I did to offend him..It's nice that they make noise only from 9 to 5 during the rennovation. Too bad I was in the room trying to work from 9 to 12 noon. I couldn't hear myself think. They have a very nice restaurant on the top floor. Very nice view of the city. Other than the construction, it's not a bad hotel.",25-Apr-12,4
"Great service, superb rooms, great food, awesome environment. Location the best in the world. Try the 32nd floor club room with the greatest view of the Bay and that's it. Beat stress , stay in this hotel for your San Francisco vacation. Everything within reach and food and shopping is as easy as 123...Unbeatable experience. The staff is one of the best I've experienced travelling all over the world.",24-Apr-12,5
"Stayed in March 2012 for 1 night while on a business trip. The location, just off Union Square and the high-end shopping streets -- is unbeatable. The rooms are spacious and have just been renovated, which is great. The lobby was still being renovated and felt cramped, especially when many guests were checking in/out at the same time. Superb views towards the Bay and Alcatraz from the bar on the top floor, excellent cocktails. My room was on the 14 floor overlooking the street, so I could hear street noise well into the late hours. Ask for a room on an even higher floor, perhaps with a view to the square or the bay,",24-Apr-12,4
"This hotel has just undergone a major renovation and the rooms are great. They are large, well appointed and very comfortable. The renovation is still progressing in the lobby area, but they have sealed it off so you hardly notice and certainly are not inconvenienced in any way. The location is fantastic, being one block to cable cars, and right next to Union Square shopping and sight seeing. All the hotel employees that we encountered were extremely helpful.",23-Apr-12,5
"This Grand Hyatt has an excellent location with easy walking distance to cable cars, BART station, all kinds of bus stops. The top floor restaurant has a breathtaking view of SF. We didn't drive, but I imagine driving from/to this hotel would be challenging with all the traffic. Rooms are tastefully appointed, clean and comfortable, after all it is a Hyatt. Really close to shops. Suitable for people who don't mind walking a little and use public transportation. ",22-Apr-12,4
"Good hotel, great location in the commercial area of san franscicos. Nice bar at the top with great views, express check in.",22-Apr-12,4
"Very unfriendly check in, waiters in the breakfast etc..espresso machine in the restaurants was out of order during my complete stay.Rooms are clean but windows are tin, so you can hear the city vibes rigth up to you room. They claim to had renovated the place but it was done very poor. Internet is charged and mega slow. I stayed at le meridien last time and will probably go back to that one.",21-Apr-12,1
"Stayed here for 4 nights last September for a conference. Fantastic location with decent room service food. The views from some of the rooms are superb. They had a union strike going on while we were there which was really annoying and loud, but the staff went out of their way to make up for the distractions and this was most appreciated. They moved us to a higher floor to get us away from the noise. They did their best to shield guests getting in and out of the door from the protestors. i would certainly stay here again for business or pleasure.",19-Apr-12,4
"My girlfriend and I stayed here last week and paid about $275 (with parking) during the week. The hotel was very clean and nicely kept but was less than I was expecting. I guess for that type of money I was expecting a little more. The lobby was smaller than I expected and wasn't all that flattering. Apparently, there is a really nice restaurant at the top of the hotel that has a great view of the city but we never did venture up there. The hotel is right in the heart of all the shopping. When traveling to San Francisco next, I won't be staying at the Grand Hyatt unless there is a really good deal on it.",19-Apr-12,3
"This is my second visit to the Grand Hyatt.Pros:Friendly StaffNice, clean, spacious roomsNice view of the city from the bar on the top floorNice sized gymGood LocationCons:Not much, some of my colleagues compalined of street noise at night, but I had a high floor room and had no issues.Overall I would recommend this hotel.",18-Apr-12,4
"stayed here again. newley rennovated rooms. very stylish with a modern look. great bathroom too and a great view of the financial area from our room. exceptional bed, so comfy.great cocktail lounge on the 36th floor with wonderful views.excellent breakfast too.when leaving ratherthan a taxi, gave us a town car at the same price to the airport.",16-Apr-12,5
This Hotel is amazing great location very close to most of San Francisco attractions Staff was really great had a room on a high floor and had a room facing the bay and Alcatraz Island we would defiantly be staying here again,16-Apr-12,5
"This Hyatt is located in a great central location in a city where there is so much to see and do. Catching a bus or the BART is as simple as walking a couple blocks, restaurants are plentiful for a close place to eat and the hotel itself is very accommodating and clean.",16-Apr-12,5
"This hotel is at the walking distance to union square, the heart of all the activities. The location is also quiet and pretty safe wherein you will not find homeless at the side of the streets. The lobby is not so big but it is contemporary designed. The room has automatic window shield.Amenities is good enough but has no shower cap and sandals. The hotel staff are helpfull. I was desparately in need of a camera charger at a very early in the morning and Irvin, one of the staff really made an extra effort to find the charger. He brought all the chargers the hotel had and tried to match it with what I need. I appreciate it so much.The hotel has a ready ticket for hop on and hop off city tour and can also help to book a ticket to alcatraz. Very efficient and that is what we need as a tourist.",15-Apr-12,4
"First time to stay at this property, and I probably would return. However, there are a few things about the property that struck me as odd. First, there is no convenience store in the hotel, or even a little shop off the lobby that so many hotels are moving to. I had to go up to the restaurant and get them to make something for me for breakfast, to take back down to my room after a workout. The lobby itself is completely underwhelming and cramped. A Hyatt Place lobby blows it out of the water. The room, recently renovated, was very nice and comfortable, although I could not figure out how to turn the corner floor lamp on. Finally (and this is a growing pet peeve, albeit a First World problem), an HDTV looks pretty ridiculous when there are no digital signals from which to choose.",12-Apr-12,4
Staying on the 32nd floor in a newly renovated room with laminated hardwood floors. Generally clean and comfy but the water pressure for the shower is on the low side. Friendly check-in staff. Lobby is currently under renovation. Good location in SF.,11-Apr-12,5
"Perhaps we have been spoilt as having always stayed in Grand Hyatts, primarily on Far East holidays, our expectations were very high, only to be rather disappointed. The stay was perfectly adequate - we stayed 6 nights.The plus points: convenient location off Union Square, rooms had nice decor, beds very comfortable, top floor restaurant has fabulous views and food was fine. The negatives: lobby is dull and front desk check-in experience was disappointing - served by a gentleman (rather unfriendly)... I asked if we could have a higher floor with a view if possible - he replied yes, nice room and good view. We ended up on the 12th floor with no view onto the back of a couple of buildings and some industrial centre roof. Woken at 4am each morning to some form of lorries unloading which we assumed took place underneath the industrial roof we could see below us - this only lasted about 30 mins each morning.Whilst in-room cleaning was fine with friendly, pleasant maids, glasses/trays were left outside various rooms on the 12th floor and we were astonished to see a couple of particular trays left for 3 days whilst we stayed which had food on! Very poor for this type of establishment.Grand view restaurant where we had the breakfast buffet each morning had beautiful views - staff were generally very pleasant and accommodating. Food was generally of a good standard, albeit, the hot buffet items did tend to be on the ""lukewarm"" side, so by the time back to your table, items often cold. Furniture items in bar/lounge area adjacent to restaurant were generally very tired and could do with a facelift.Check-out : front desk tried to charge us for 6 nights accommodation (which had already been pre-paid through Virgin holidays) - this was quickly rectified once I complained.Hence, our average rating ... admittedly, we did not complain to anyone about any of the issues we encountered ... provided our room was clean with comfortable beds, we were often not in the hotel long enough to worry about things as we were out enjoying the fantastic city of San Francisco.",11-Apr-12,3
"Enjoyed our stay at Grand Hyatt Union Square, beds were very comfortable, staff helpful and despite hotel being busy with guests it was very quiet in the rooms. We faced the back of the hotel but had a great view over the city. Location was especially good, right in the heart of things in Union Square and shopping district, easy to get tours and close to cafe's. Would recommend Louis's Diner for breakfast, just around the corner from the hotel. Cheesecake Factory was great for meals too located at top of Macy's building 5mins walk away. Skybar in Hotel really nice and great cocktails in evening with lovely staff. Only a few minutes to cable car turnaround on Powell Street which takes you straight to Fisherman's Wharf. Alot of homeless in San Francisco but none of them were intrusive or dangerous and felt safe entire time we were there despite venturing out and walking around city alot. Would definitely stay at Grand Hyatt again they clearly conform to a high standard.",9-Apr-12,4
"Our experience at this hotel was very good. The rooms are always spotless and in good repair.I hate to be picky however .......1. the shower head was terrible. No matter how I adjusted it I had to stand within inches of the head and on the drain to get water. Change the head so it shoots water out farther. I would probably not stay here again because of this.2. the location of the toilet paper roll is quite a distance behind you causing you to ""twist around"" in an uncomfortable position....why not use a portable holder?3. the toilets are the ""highest"" I have encountered which is good for a tall person like me however my wife's feet would not reach the floor.",8-Apr-12,4
 Trip advisor does it again this hotel was a good choice because it is close to everything I thoroughly enjoyed my stay the only downside room was small. But that's how things are in San Francisco but they do maximize the use of space.,6-Apr-12,4
"We were pleasantly surprised by this place. The new decor is very nice, and the room (especially the bed) was very comfortable. The location couldn't have been more ideal. If you stay be sure to visit the restaurant and bar on the top floor for an unprecidented view of the city and harbour.",4-Apr-12,5
Wonderful and beautiful hotel we go there every year because my mom grew up there. We look forward to going there every year. It is in a very great location it is right by union square.,3-Apr-12,5
"The positives:1. Rooms are modern, clean, beautiful; beds lovely.2. Views are wonderful (we were on 31st floor).3. Concierge was extremely helpful with rental car, planning trips, etc. 4. Regency Club was AMAZING. I miss it already! (huge high-quality food selection, super clean, lots of space & areas to sit, very friendly & professional Regency Club staff). 5. As usual, the ventilation for the rooms was fantastic (typical Hyatt).6. Perfect Location!Negatives:1. Rooms a little on the small sideThank you Hyatt! You made our stay in San Francisco wonderful!",3-Apr-12,5
We stayed here before heading up hours north to go to a family wedding. Great time! Great people! Just a terrific experience. I absolutely recommend staying here for business or leisure. It's also in a convenient sport to access the rest of the city.,2-Apr-12,5
"We stayed at this hotel for a whole week. It is very well located within short distance to the Cable Car stop, Union Square and Moscone Center. Rooms were impeccable - very well decorated, excellent beds and with a nice working desk. Bathroom amenities were also very nice. My wife accidentally dropped her earing in the sink and we were able to get the engineering team in the room at midnight to open the sink's piping and recover it! Great service! Be sure to visit the restaurant for a great view of San Francisco skyline.",2-Apr-12,5
We had not stayed here for a number of years. The hotel has just gone through a renovations. Our room was clean with a great view. All new items in the guest rooms and very comfortable beds. Had dinner first night in Grand View Restaurant on 36th floor. It was fantastic and Frank our waiter was wonderful as well as the Assistant Restaurant Manager. All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and had a genuine desire to help you. Stay here you cannot go wrong.,1-Apr-12,5
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt in the last week of March for 2 nights. First of all, the location was the most convenient! There is BURT, Muni bus station right down the street. We could go anywhere in the town of San Francisco from here. There are many shops around the hotel. My sister and my mom are from Japan (I live in Ohio) and they wanted to go specific brand name store. We could walk most of the stores and department stores from the hotel. We could go to China town to have some dim-sum (Yum!) The hotel room had a modern interior. Very clean. The beds were very comfortable. We stayed at 31st floor. The city view was incredible. I am glad we stayed at Grand Hyatt!",31-Mar-12,5
"Grand Hyatt is @ the heart of San Francisco (Union Square). Very close to everything: shoppings, cable car which brings you Fisherman's Wharf, China town, etc... Service is excellent and staff very professional. Concierge services were great. There is a very nice view from the 36th floor where you can have breakfast, drinks & food. Very comfortable. I had a very good time while my stay despite a noisy night from my neighbors once next room.You have the sightseeing buses stop in front of the hotel in Union Square.",31-Mar-12,5
"We stayed at the Hyatt in early November for 3 nights. The city view room we had was very comfortable and the beds were incredibly comfortable! The location is very convenient for many tourist attractions and shopping. San Francisco was an unbelievable culinary experience everywhere we went. Miette, the Ferry Building, Swan Oyster Depot, Zuni Cafe, Delphina, Mission Street Chinese and even the restaurant in the mall Cupola was amazing!",28-Mar-12,4
My room is practically brand new - the whole hotel has been re-done - except the lobby which is not finished yet - no signs of construction however as the lobby has been re-configured during construction. Room was great - location great - nice bathroom sink etc - great all around.,27-Mar-12,5
"We stayed here for 3 nights with several other couples and all of us had a great experience. First off I have learned that travel websites aren't the cheapest route to go...we booked directly through the Hyatt and ended up changing our reservations 4 times because we kept finding better deals directly through them. That may aggravate some people but I check that kind of stuff all the time so I love it that you don't get penalized for making changes.Anyway, we went from $229 a night, down to $170 a night, then to a special where it was $209 a night but if you stayed 3 nights you got the third night free, plus breakfast for 2 each morning. So in the end we felt like we got a great deal. The hotel is right at Union Square, easy walk to trolley and BART. Nice location for shopping and dining. The rooms are accurately represented in posted photos. Not super huge but very chic and inviting. The bed was very comfy, there was a small fridge, coffee maker, bathroom well appointed and modern. No complaints at all. Maid service was very prompt in the mornings, we ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant every morning and it was wonderful. Servers and everyone we encountered were very friendly and helpful. In general San Francisco is a VERY NOISY place and I was woke up several times by trolley bells ringing but I didn't feel that was something the hotel could control. The lobby is currently being renovated but that didn't impact anything we did. Actually didn't hear any noise coming from there. I would stay here again and would definately recommend it to others.",26-Mar-12,5
"Stayed here in March 2012 to attend a conference at the Moscone Center (convention center). The location is great. One block off of Union Square, and a 10 minute walk from the Moscone center. The rooms are spacious and modern, with beautiful views. Bedding was very comfortable. Good bathrooms. Tub with shower had decent water pressure. I had a room on the 20th floor. Room was right off of the corridor from the elevators, and I never heard a peep from the hallway. Occasionally heard the people in the adjacent room, but nothing out of the ordinary. Fitness center on 35th floor was spacious, with ellipticals, treadmills, stationary bikes, freeweights, plenty of machines, and a separate space for floorwork.Technology in room was acceptable, but if you're a technophile, you might be a little disappointed. 42"" LCD TV and great channel selection, but no hi-def selections. HDMI and audio ports for easy connection of laptops or ipods to the tv. Alarm clock with ipod and 3.5 mm connectors. I paid for the premium internet service for the week. Had both wifi and ethernet connections in room, and a passcode to connect a mobile device. Speeds were good for browsing and email, but a bit slow for VPN connections. The reason I will be coming back to this hotel is because of the personal service. Reception staff was friendly and efficient. I checked in early (~1:30 pm, before the check-in time) on a Saturday afternoon, along with about 10 other people, and the staff moved us through. The bell staff has a great presence, always available to answer questions. The crown jewel of this place is the doorman, Michael. It rained the entire week that I was there, so he was the busiest man in San Francisco. Everyone who would normally be walking to the Moscone center was trying to catch a taxi, and he and his staff took care of each and every one of us, while also taking exquisite care of arriving guests, and people checking out.Overall, this is a good San Francisco hotel in a great location with an excellent staff. I'll be back in May for Bay to Breakers, and I'll be staying here again.",24-Mar-12,4
"Stayed in one of the removed rooms on a pretty high floor. Still had a strange ""refurbed rather than new"" feel to it, maybe that's because it's such an eyesore from the outside which is a trait it shares with most Downtown Hotels in San Francisco, unfortunately. I personally didn't like the design of the room at all but that's a matter of taste. They went for a strange 70ies vintage style decor with lots of orange and stuff like it which reminds me of my parents' taste when I was a very young kid. Not my thing really and makes you wonder how people will feel about this in 5 or 10 years time...Worst grief for me was the staff, the check in area hasn't been renovated yet so you are greeted in one of those dimly lit, dark wooded lobbies from the 60ies. Right went I arrived, there were about 5 huge Latin families with their badly behaved screaming kids all over which was a nightmare but unfortunately, my check in lady also was not very friendly, disengaged and rather quick to get you out and done with.Room itself, as said, was quite nice depending on whether you like 70ies vintage or not. They had those strange snake-like reading lamps sticking out of the wall besides the bed which you used to have in old business class airplane seats-I hate those things, feels like some creepy alien coming out of your bed head but maybe that's meant to be part f the vintage style, who knows. Very vintage but absolutely not acceptable were the shower curtains. Shower curtains in a freshly renovated hotel- need I say more? Cummon, Hyatt, you can do better- they are yuck!Speaking about vintage... Obviously their wifi has also not made it to 2012 yet. The website claims high-speed Wifi and when you log in to accept the 10 Dollar charge a day (!!!), they tell you some blurb about extra bandwidth and so on. But the reality is: It is s-l-o-w. So slow that it drops out all the time and you need ten minutes alone to log onto your emails. I was close to throwing my IPad against the wall in anger, so bad and frustrating it was!Now, after all that, luckily my lady at check out made up for a lot of the negatives: Very unlike the check in lady, she wad friendly, helpful and pleasant. Took the Wifi charges off my bill instantly and was very apologetic. Apparently, people complain about this all the time and the hotel is investigating their options. We had a long chat about it and she told me that the Wifi antennas are located in the elevator shafts only (which explains why you get the best reception on the elevators) which she already knew was not ideal. Without her, the experience would have been really bad (for example, during my entire two-day stay, not a sinlge time one of the people at the door or any other staff would great me or, more even, open the door or something like they do at many other properties of this class)- like this, I would say it was mediocre.",23-Mar-12,3
"Nicely renovated rooms and accommodating staff but the hotel lacks a lobby to sit down in (perhaps that will change after the public area renovations are complete) and no business center to print a document from. The internet connections are absolutely horrible and should be included in the room rate. For a fee - it should be fast, reliable service. It's almost impossible to do business from your room. Even the wired service is horrible. The Hotel restaurant is really just average even with its lovely views of San Francisco Bay. The hotel has a great location. You can walk to almost everything.",21-Mar-12,3
"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Hyatt for our 5th anniversary. Now I am not a big fan of San Francisco, but I must say that our experience with the hotel and the location was superb! The rooms, service, and location were wonderful. I enjoyed talking to the staff and they suggested several places for dinner to celebrate the special occasion. The only complaint I have is the wireless internet (wi-fi) which you have to pay for. You would think it would be included with the rate of the room, although we did get a great deal on the price. All in all, we had a terrific time!",20-Mar-12,5
"Staying in Grand Hyatt for business 2nd year in a row. Renovated rooms are just great, as well as the service and location of the hotel. The only complain is regarding hotel wi-fi. It's an absolute disaster. Even though you normally have to pay for it (except the conference packages where it's already included), it just doesn't worth any money at all - I would even say that Hyatt has to pay those guests who preferred their Internet as the stress is guaranteed. Me and my colleagues had to go to the Starbucks across the street or to some Hyatt public area where we could still catch Starbucks' wi-fi. How crazy is that considering the fact you paid for the opportunity to work/surf from your room?.. Guys, do something with it - it's a total shame.",17-Mar-12,5
"My husband and I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt in SF twice and like the recently renovated accommodations. It is right in the shopping area and there are so many restaurants to choose from. We are walkers and sometimes we take the hilly route over to Fisherman's Wharf, but we can avoid the steep climb and take a flat route along the Embarcadero. We enjoy sipping our martinis with the spectacular view in the restaurant.",17-Mar-12,5
"Had a fantastic stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. The location is excellent, the room rates are fairly reasonable and the room with a view was just absolutely breathtaking. Staff was helpful. Felt very at home.",16-Mar-12,4
"There are a few things you should know about my visit. 1. I'm extremely particular and travel extensively. 2. I don't visit San Francisco very often, but since I love this city and wanted this to be a great trip, I researched where I would stay extensively and even changed my mind a few times about where I would stay. I'm so happy to say that the Grand Hyatt was an excellent choice. Upon arrival, Alex at the front desk made sure that I knew that the room I booked (Bay View--totally worth it) was a particularly great view, but that it was next to the ice machine in case I thought this would be a problem. I took the room and the proximity of the ice machine didn't cause any problems, but I so appreciated that I was alerted to this so that I had the option of another room. It turns out the that proximity to the ice machine was actually a good thing--it meant that I only shared a wall with one other room and I was at the end of the hallway--so it was quiet. Others have commented on thin walls and I can see where this would be a problem--but my location minimized this issue. Alex at the front desk also told me that the majority of the rooms connect, but this room did not connect to another room which also minimized noise. I was in room 2505--so the 05 rooms are good--especially the high floors. This was a bay view room--I paid a bit more--and it was completely worth it--the view was outstanding--Alcatraz and the Bay! Others have also commented about street noise--and I did notice this but it wasn't a big deal--it's a city after all and this is to be expected. The room itself is a little small, but the layout is good and they did a great job on the renovation--so made up for size. It's an efficient use of space, had a mini-fridge and a great closet.The location is awesome--one and half blocks from Union Square Park and all the great Union Square shopping. It's a terrific area. Do yourself a favor and have a drink in the restaurant on the 36th floor-breathtaking views--walk all the way around the space and see panoramic views of the city--great!I'm so glad that I chose the Grand Hyatt--and I am really particular. The lobby is under renovation which didn't cause any problems, but it should be even nicer when this is complete. Great stay!",12-Mar-12,5
Attended course held at Grand Hyatt. Rooms were handsome and well-planned (with lots of guest friendly details) . Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Restaurant had wonderful view. Food was good. Location was great for shopping and site-seeing. Staff was very professional and courteous. Concierge was very helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed stay. Starbucks across the street is added bonus. Some ongoing construction in lobby.,10-Mar-12,4
"I spent 3 days at the Grand Hyatt during a recent business trip to San Francisco. The rooms at the hotel were very modern and luxurious - and the bathrooms were appointed with high-end fixtures, tiles and lighting. The view from my room was spectacular with the ability to see the bay, Transamerica pyramid building and the downtown financial district. It really gave you a sense of being in 'the city'. The lobby in the hotel is pretty small and not somewhere that you can hang out, have a coffee and chat with business partners. While the 36th floor does have a bar area, it's a little more formal than just a place where you can sit in a comfy sofa and connect with colleagues. However, the views from the 36th floor are spectacular - and the service was very good.The gym at the hotel has quite a bit of good equipment (4-5 treadmills, 4-5 eliptical machines and 4 recumbant bikes - plus a variety of exercise machines for arms/legs/etc.). If you want to use the cardio equipment, you need to get to the gym around 5:30AM or you'll wait in line or simply need to use the other equipment. It's a big hotel - and there are lots of people who want to work out. Staff at the hotel was very friendly - and the hotel is in a PERFECT spot to walk to many of the parts of SFO that you'd want to visit for shopping, sights and meals. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again on future trips.",8-Mar-12,4
"So we stayed here for one week. I don't have much time to write everything in much detail, so I would rather list in bullet points:- The rooms are newly renovated and very nice and contemporary- The lobby is small and the public space and restaurant on 36th floor are still old and dated- We used our Diamond upgrade for a suite, upon check in and arrival to our room, got an ""accessible roll in shower"" room - not what we wanted. The bellman kindly called the front desk, and the agent had the nerve to tell us that ALL suites were like the one we were in - really?- So the bellman, knowing I was upset, called Chris the manager, who was more than kind and accomodating- We got a regular suite which was nice until we went to take showers in BOTH bathrooms. The tubs were stopped up and within minutes of shower - we had 3 inches of water accumlated- It took 3 trips from maintenance to fix the problem- The next day - the ondemand movie system didn't work- The internet was intermittent and slow- We went to run at 7am up in the gym, surprised to find only 3 treadmills!!! All used - how can a hotel this big only have 3 treadmills!So, the location is great - the rooms look really great and bed was amazingly comfortable - but the systems in general were just not operable enough to provide a ""worry-free"" stay.",7-Mar-12,3
Held our Western leadership meetings at this property. Great experience. Workout facilities were nice. Make sure you get there early...no later than 5:30 am to get equipment. ,5-Mar-12,4
"Stayed at the Grand for three nights on a business trip. Excellent location, just off Union Square, close to China Town, easy 10 min walk to Moscone Center. Lots of great places to eat and shop. Std rooms offer great views, modern, luxurious, and clean. Minor issue - A blocked bath tub was quickly cleaned up and corrected by engineering. Make sure to visit the Grandviews bar and lounge on the 36th floor for spectacular views day and night. Food and drinks are a little overpriced but worth the opportunity to linger awhile. Check in and check out was quick and efficient. Use the online quick check out if you are the DIY type. Hotel offers a town car for rides to SFO airport for $50. The same ride in a taxi is around $45, so its a good deal if you want a little luxury. Paid $200 per night + $30 in taxes. Internet access was included because of a conference I was attending. Overall - good value for money and would definitely stay her again.",4-Mar-12,5
"We stayed at this hotel for four nights and it is conveniently located right at one corner of Union Square, a great place to stay when in San Francisco! Nice stores and restaurants can be found all around. Market St is just a short walk, as well as the stop to get the cable car to FishermanÂ´s Wharf. If you are traveling by car, thereÂ´s a parking lot nearby (donÂ´t worry - hotel staff do all the job for you...). Although a bit ""business-y"", the rooms are modern and relatively spacious. Breakfast (very good, by the way...) is served on top floor, with an amazing view of the Golden Gate!",3-Mar-12,5
"While I have lived in the Bay Area in the past, this was my first stay in the city. It is conveniently located to shopping and transportation and we found that it was also quiet. The views from the restaurant on the 36th floor were amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast buffet while enjoying the scenery. The staff was very friendly and helpful but never pushy. The room was beautifully decorated and our room on the 16th floor had a wonderful view overlooking Union Square and beyond. The beds were comfortable and had handy reading lights. We all enjoyed the push button controlled window shade. Valet parking also was efficient and easy and getting to the main thoroughfares from this location was a breeze.I would happily stay here again.",1-Mar-12,5
"I have spent time in many hotels in downtown San Francisco. For the last two trips I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt and it has become my favorite hotel in the area. The rooms are great--I like the design and they have several design touches that make the rooms very nice to stay in--things like reading lights, TVs with adjustable viewing angles and extensions, iphone charging through the clock radios, and interesting designs in the bathrooms.I do wish that the TV stations were in HD--they TVs are HD but the broadcasts are not updated yet...Looking forward to many more stays in the future at the Grand Hyatt.",28-Feb-12,5
I never write reviews but have always depended on them so I figured I would write one to help others. I read a lot of reviews and agree with them all. The staff was very friendly and the hotel itself was nice. They had staff to open the doors for you and check in was very simple while everyone was very willing to help. The rooms are very well kept and had a modern contemporary decor. The hotel on the 36th floor was nice and we enjoyed our stay...I would defiantly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco,26-Feb-12,5
I have stayed at many hotels near Union Square over the years but our recent stay at the Grand Hyatt was a real surprise! The rooms have been recently redone in a modern style that is very appealing. The location is superb for business or pleasure! The bar on the 35th floor has incredible views of Alcatraz and the Bay. Will definitely return.,23-Feb-12,4
"We loved it here! The room is modern, with a panoramic view of the city and the San Francisco Bay from a floor-to-ceiling window. The hotel is ideally located on Union Square, so getting anywhere is a breeze. Using public transport is more convenient here. If you drove here, you can park at the garage next door. You'll get a discount as a Hyatt guest. Alternatively, you can always valet ;)We enjoyed dinner and a night view of the city at the Grandviews Restaurant. The restaurant boasts a fantastic view overlooking San Francisco. Even if you are not staying at the hotel, do come and have a meal here. The food is pretty good and you won't be disappointed with the view.",20-Feb-12,5
"The beauty of staying at the Grand Hyatt is it's proximity to Union Square. There is something for everyone in the area. Even after having lived in San Francisco for a number of years, the appeal of downtown never grows old. Theatres, spa treatments, music, art museums, and of course, shopping are all within walking distance. The Grand Hyatt is in the process of renovation. The lobby is all boarded up and it is quite crowded as there is little space to hang around while checking in. I was told all that would go away by Summer. We were upgraded to a city-view Pure room which has a hypo-allergenic environment. There is a HEPA filtering machine in the room -- yes, you can hear it but it didn't interfere with my sleep. The room also has individual reading lamps with adjustable goosenecks. The furniture is modern and sleek --with an electronic window shade that you can operate from your bedside. Modern and clean and very comfortable bed. We went on a AAA package which included breakfast. The wait staff was harried and the food was okay...you can dine on better fare elsewhere. But really, what you're there for is the gorgeous view. And on a day like we had, it re-emphasized why San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It can get expensive so always be on the look-out for specials or packages. If you want to try something touristy but different, go to Mason and O'Farrell and try the GoCar tours. Guided by a GPS you ride in a 2-person car, powered by an engine with controls akin to a motorcycle. if you follow the tour route, especially the one that takes you beneath the Golden Gate bridge, you're treated to wonderful sites with an accompanying narrative. You can't go over 30 miles per hour and you have to crank up the volume to hear the tour over the sound of the motor -- but it is fun nonetheless. Be sure to wear warm clothes and gloves as it sometimes gets windy. The perspective is great because you're in an open-air vehicle.",20-Feb-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt is in an outstanding location. Right at Union Square and by all the tourist hot spots. The property itself is all renovated, which means the rooms are new, nice and up-to-date. Overall the employees were top notch and delightful at every encounter. Would definitely stay here again!",19-Feb-12,5
"Perfect place to view all San Francisco ,near Union Square , every stores and shops you wanna go , 1 block from chinatown , 1 block to catch cable car . Clean and large room , newly recent refurbished and staff very helpful all times",14-Feb-12,5
My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 4 days in July. We were given a room upgrade which had a great view of the city. The rooms were spacious and clean. The staff were very helpful at all times. Good location.,11-Feb-12,4
"We chose the Grand Hyatt due to its central location and the fact that it had been very recently refurbished. It was a great choice. Its proximity to Union Square, the cable car, good restaurants and shops was fantastic. Our room felt brand new, spotlessly clean and fresh, and was stylish and well appointed. We had a very comfortable king size bed.I particularly liked their breakfasts served in the Grandviews on top floor. The view was amazing and they had some 'stayfit' menu items that were a good healthy choice. Also a yoghurt parfait - yum.Concierge was very helpful with maps and advice and the doormen were very adept at whistling taxis for us.Overall it was an excellent stay - the only thing I was a little disappointed with was that we had booked a Bay View King room and so I was expecting a view of the Bay. The view however was of buildings with a small patch of water visible if you stood right at the corner of the window and looked very hard to find the bay between the buildings. We did not complain though, as we visited the bridge and took a cruise to Sausalito and had a great bay experience.",9-Feb-12,5
"If you want to be the heart of the action, this is where you stay. My family and I were there for 5 nights. Every day we had breakfast in one of the very many lovely places near by. The concierge service was brilliant. They were on top of things and made relevant and interesting suggestions. All the shops are at your door step. Many had said the hotel would be noisy but we never found this a problem. Highly recommend.",8-Feb-12,4
"This property was the book end to a week-long business trip to California, with less than 12 hours on the grounds. Here are the highlights:- Valet parking is $49. Don't say no one told you. According to other reviewers, there are other, cheaper alternatives in the Union Square area.- There is no sundries shop at this property. Go out the main entrance, left turn, left turn, then a half a block straight ahead to the CVS. Say hi to the Drake hotel as you pass by.- Apparently the Hyatt reservations system has a problem when a customer reserves two rooms, then changes the name of the second room to a second party with a second credit card. The 2nd room retains the mailng address of the first customer. It gets even more complexicated when the 2nd customer has a Hyatt Gold Passport number. When the Hyatt Passport number is assigned, then, the orignial reservation reverts to the address of the Gold Passport holder. (Kind of like a Lucy episode, isn't it?)- The room was an outstanding contemporary design, very Euro. Of all of the hotels I've stayed at that have used energy saving lighting, this one was the brightest by far, probably because they use a combination of high-output and LED lights. The Baby Boomers and Generation X thank you.- I struggled with operation of the electric shades, mostly because there were no instructions; I almost ripped them off the top of the mount thinking they were roller shades. Country comes to town, I guess- The bathroom was well-lit, appointed with nice towels and tolietries. The sink was PERFECT for bathing a baby; the other guy I was traveling with found it so funny he e-mailed a pic back to his wife! The unecessairly large baby bath made for a cluttered sink area--no room to put my own shaving kit down over the tolietries and glasses.- The shower was good until the adjustable head came apart in my hand. Engineering was quickly dispatched, but the man making the repair struggled with the spring loaded thing-a-ma-bob that held tension on the main pole. I had to go to the hotel bar to go to the bathroom. Good call. . .- The bar was superb. Generous pour. SUPER view of SF and the Bay. Got to see the fog roll in over a bourbon.- Hotel is in the middle of the Union Square scene--you can't beat it's location or the pick of restaurants within a block--get out of the hotel and find yourself a great place to eat--it isn't hard.- The bed was excellent--not a lick of noise, and the blackout shade I almost trashed worked great.-If you plan a trip to the San Francisco area and want to be in the middle of the action, this property should be on your short list--especially if you're traveling with a significant other and no little ones--looks like it would make a nice getaway hotel. Like another hotel I rated recently, do not pay rack rate--aggressively search for a lower rate and beware the packages with breakfasts included",7-Feb-12,4
"My family recently stayed here for 3 nights. It was a great location, which is why we chose it. We were happy enough with the renovated room and amenities that the hotel had to offer. The staff were also very helpful.This isn't top notch luxury, it's not a huge room, and the lobby is still undergoing renos, but overall it was a good stay. As my title says, the location is great, close to Chinatown and Union Square. For us, this was key to our weekend.",7-Feb-12,4
"I stayed at this hotel with family back in early December. We rented two rooms which were connecting. This was really nice as we were able to freely move between the two rooms. There was an initial hiccup with the automatic blind as it wouldn't lower properly. The guy that came to fix it was not very friendly but did manage to fix it. Then we had to call again to have them fix the drain in the bathroom sink as it was draining quite slow. They came and fixed the sink while we were gone for dinner. But when we returned the sink was not draining so I called again and the same guy came and he seemed rather put out that he had to come up again. Being that it was a modern fancy sink I did not realize that you had to push the stopper to open it (what a disgusting design and why didn't the guy leave it open when he came the first time?)Anyway, after all the maintenance was taken care of we really enjoyed our stay. The room is very clean. The bathroom is really nice too. The hotel is just about a block from Union Square which was really nice to not have to take your car out of the garage.I would recommend this hotel to others and infact I will be staying here again next month - hopefully without the maintenance issues.",7-Feb-12,4
"About a month ago I decided to spend a week in San Francisco with my wife at the beginning of April 2012. I selected the Grand Hyatt as our Hotel after some extensive research. I phoned the Hotel and was offered a suitable booking with a package which offered â€œtwo-breakfasts-for-the-price-of-oneâ€ù. Total cost â€_ a not unreasonable $1,700. When the email confirmation arrived there was only one breakfast shown. I then exchanged about five emails with the Hotel to try to have them honour their original offer. They responded each time in a most curmudgeonly way - offering alternatives that were all less attractive than the original offer. After a month of emails I decided they were simply not going to give this particular potential customer a taste of their â€œexpect nothing less than spectacularâ€ù slogan.I finally cancelled the booking and booked an alternative hotel in San Francisco.The purpose of this review is to give people a flavour of the Hyatt Hotel policy towards guests. I donâ€™t know if the original offer was a mistake or not. No one in Hyatt referred to it in any of the exchanges. However, once made, the Hilton Staff should have set about making a potential customer happy. For the marginal cost of a breakfast they lost at least $1700 worth of business and released a dissatisfied customer into the travel world, without even having stayed at their Hotel.What a great dayâ€™s work!",3-Feb-12,1
"This hotel is located right in the financial district, within a block of Chinatown, luxury shops, two blocks to the cable car stop and wonderful restaurants. Taxi ride is a short distance to Harris's Steakhouse restaurant, one of the best.",30-Jan-12,5
"General SUMMARY: Center of it all location, renovated rooms, efficient + friendly service and wonderful views...totally satisfied.CHECK-IN: Smooth, uncomplicated and recognized as rewards program members. Only shortfall, would have beneficial for agent to ask about whether I was parking, as I called ahead and apparently given incorrect parking information.F&B: Ah...Only had a chance to enjoy breakfast buffet, but what a setting. Gorgeous views of the bay, fair value for upscale hotels and overall a really nice assortment of offerings. Not sure if there were other dining options at the hotel besides main restaurant, but plenty to choose from outside the front doors.AMENITIES: Gym was modern and set atop one of the higher floors, so once again fantastic views. I was pretty much alone, but could see it getting pretty packed at peak period. Great equipment though. LOCATION: Excellent, heart of the city on the corner of Union Square...convenient access to the Trolley, BART, public bus, and city parking. Upscale and most popular stores/shops and Chinatown are are stone's throw. Couldn't be better.ACCOMMODATIONS: Recently Renovated and gorgeous. Warm brown/orange tones, great linens and mattress. Flawless technology and electrically controlled shades. Bath was clean and super modern; nice toiletries...and the first vessel sink I actually liked...large enough to bathe a baby in. One caveat, water pressure in the shower was a little soft, so room for improvement there. Nice clean/fresh scent.SHORTFALLS: Water Pressure in the shower. Small lobby that is under renovation and can get annoyingly congested at peak check-in/check/out times. Rates encroach into luxury territory.RECOMMENDATION: One of the best upscale hotels in down San Francisco. Weekend rates were about $400 that weekend, so not cheap and at the price, you were really paying a premium, but not there was a NFL playoff game in town that weekend. Would love to stay here again, but ask for either Union Square or Bay View (Premium Rate). Also if parking, make sure to pull up to valet first and if you want to self park, they will provide you directions and a ticket. Self park is literally across the street.",29-Jan-12,4
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt last weekend and there is only way to describe our experience 'Just Excellent'. They have a great restaurant for breakfast and their location was very convenient for our needs. Our room was great and I like the amenities and thick towels. We would recommend this Hotel to anyone who would like to stay in a quality establishment.,29-Jan-12,5
"Stayed here for 5 nights and chose this one for 2 reasons - its location and our previous great stays at Hyatt properties throughout the world. I have to say we were left disappointed in some respects.The front desk staff seemed more attentive to their business customers than us. Perhaps they are more at ease with people wearing suits just like them - I don't know. I do know that when you are waiting for service and someone turns their back on you to talk on the phone, it isn't good manners. Again, waiting for service without being acknowledged - it's just poor training. If there was only one person trying to service the front desk you might forgive them - but more often there were 4 - 6 staff.There was also the issue of Hyatt's method of rating your stay that needs some detailing. Unless you email Hyatt directly with your observations to the contrary, they rate your stay as ""exceptional."" I find this presumption rather rude. I did pass on other concerns via email and, to be fair these matters were addressed. However, one thing remains - it is a Hyatt property and I have always preferred them - I expected a great deal better and hopefully their training methods improve.",28-Jan-12,3
I had a great stay. Was there for a meeting.My room was a bit small but that is to be expected in a standard room in the city.Location was great. Within walking distance to local restaurants and shopping.,27-Jan-12,5
"The location is terrific. Within walking distance of lots of shopping and great dinning. The hotel is also only a couple of blocks from BART which makes getting there from the airport easy and cheap. The rooms are great and clean. The hotel is large with several towers so each tower feels like you are in a smaller property. The Starbucks in the lobby is very well used and convenient. Their scones were always very fresh. There are street people close by once you leave, but typical urban hotel issues. I never felt in any danger from the street people and tell them to leave you alone and they will.",27-Jan-12,5
"Location: Great location right next to Union Square. Room: I got a newly renovated suite. It was a very impressive looking room with dark hardwood floors. The room had automatic blinds and two large flat screen TVs. There was also two full bathrooms. My only grip about the bathrooms was the water pressure or the lack there of.Room View: I was on the 18th room. The view was 'ok', but nothing amazing. Club Lounge/View: We spent good amount of time in the lounge of the hotel. The view from here is VERY nice. You could see more of the Bay including Alcatraz. Diamond member get access to the lounge for free, but you can get access via certain rate plans. Well worth it if you don't have the status. The breakfast and evening h'orderves are very good. You can also get wine, beer, or anything from the bar for a very reasonable price.Parking: Is quite expensive. $32 for self parking You can park at Union Square for $27.On a side note: I could hear traffic from my room. So people on lower floors beware.",26-Jan-12,5
Reaction here is a crap hole. Needs totally gutted. Grubby carpets grubby lifts. Room a bit better but small. Accessible room had no spy hole at wheelchair height. Shower would work when I used it. Lots of better hotels nearby. Wifi that you have to pay for gave me dial up speeds. No water in room and empty fridge. ,25-Jan-12,1
"Location: Great location next to Union Square. Room View: I don't recommend paying the premium to have a view of Union Square from this hotel or the other surrounding hotels. We got a ""high"" room, but we aimed ""West"" - I think you want to aim North or East. Anyway, it was a nice room - clean, etc. everything you'd expect from Hyatt.Hotel View: We spent significant time up in the lounge of the hotel - it is BREATHTAKING. Get a glass of wine and sit overlooking an extra-wide array of windows beautifully framing what feels like the entire SF Bay, including Alcatraz front and center.Parking: Don't park with the hotel if you want to save money. When you pull up they ask you if you want something like ""assisted parking"". That means nothing more than they verbally tell you in which nearby garage to park, and then you drop your car off at that garage. The one upside is that you can get unlimited in and out. If you are mostly on foot or public transit, then there is no upside.Everything Else: Good quality Hyatt stuff. Its a big hotel, so you don't get the boutique quaintness, etc.",24-Jan-12,4
"The hotel is a very short half block from Union Square. So glad we chose this hotel! China Town's main entrance is only several blocks from the hotel and within easy walking distance. The rooms are newly renovated and very nice. Size is a bit small but we didn't spend much time in the rooms. Beds and bedding are top quality. It was like sleeping on a cloud. The staff was VERY accommodating and could not have been nicer in every way. The bar and restaurant on the top floor have the most beautiful views of the bay and Alcatraz! It's breathtaking to watch the fog roll in and over the bay and rock. What a view !!Food? Honestly, it was typical hotel food. Not terrible but not great. Mixed drinks were expensive but to be expected. Highly recommend!",22-Jan-12,4
"This hotel located in Union Square is very conveniently and centrally located in San Francisco. While we were there there were many Improvements being made, especially in the lobby area. I found the staff to be helpful when in need of a taxi or advice for a nice restaurant. The room we stayed in was on the 11th floor overlooking Union Square and the bay in the distance. While we did not eat at the hotel I suggest you check out the views from the restaurant on the 36th floor. The rooms are newly updated and I found the bed and linens to be quite comfortable. I loved the automatic shade for the window. There is a great breakfast restaraunt named Honey Honey that the concierege turned us on to, it's about 4-5 blocks away. I was a little disappointed that there was not a pool or hot tub as we walked a lot and could've used a refreshing dip. We would definitely stay at this hotel again when visiting San Francisco. I should also mention I booked though Priceline for $135 a night!!! Rooms like ours were going for $301. This made the stay even that more enjoyable.",22-Jan-12,5
"Just loved this hotel even though they were refurbishing the lobby level. All the staff we had contact with were excellent, showing courtesy and respect. They were also happy to help. The room was on the 28th floor and modernly furnished and the full length windows on such a high level allowed for a spectacular view day and night. The location was excellent just adjacent to Union Square, lots of good shopping around.",21-Jan-12,5
"The hotel is in a great location in San Francisco. You are able to get on the cable cars, buses and BART in a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Rooms are spacious and they provided robes on request. The gym is pretty good size and head phones and towels are provided. The concierge's were very busy and not always as patient as one would like. Shopping is great and is readily available from the hotel. Doormen were always helpful in securing a cab for guests.",19-Jan-12,4
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco has all the trappings of a busy tourist hotel as demonstrated by the large masses of tourists coming and going from the lobby throughout the day. Nonetheless, it was a good stay. It appears that the lobby level is under renovation, but that didn't affect our stay. We stayed in a suite which appears to have been recently renovated so it was large, clean and nicely decorated. It honestly felt like we were staying in a fun little apartment as opposed to a corporate hotel. One downside to our room was the noise--(a) as high up as we were, you could still hear the frequent doorman whistles hailing cabs; and (b) our room was right next to a housekeeping closet so everytime someone went in that closet to get supplies or the vacuum, you could hear that noise too.The Grand Club was large and very busy and the staff there was attentive and welcoming. The fitness center is large by hotel standards with enough new equipment (cardio, machine weights and dumbbells) to keep any gym rat happy. The property is on Union Square, so it's close to many attractions and shopping. The staff were good about acknowledging our Diamond Gold Passport status at check-in and the housekeeping staff we encountered was always super pleasant and on top of everything. Basically this isn't the type of property where you come to get pampered--when we called for a bucket of ice, we were pleasantly told we could get it ourselves at the ice machine down the hall. Also, it seems that some of the staff could use some better training to know their hotel's amenities and to respect guest wishes. For example, we asked a front desk person for the nearest ATM and she gave me an odd look and pointed to the ATM right behind me in the lobby. I had to point out to her the large ""Out of Order"" sign on the ATM. Another example, when we have the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, the hotel shouldn't then call and disturb us to ask when can they make up the room. These are little issues that I wouldn't expect at a Hyatt. Overall, it was a good stay without any major incidents or notable events. We'll be back.",18-Jan-12,3
"I booked this hotel as part of a surprise trip for my wife's birthday. The reviews for the hotel tempted me and I was not disappointed! I really couldn't fault this hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it. It has a great location, only a 2 minute walk from Union Square and close to lot's of restaurants and bars. The concierge service at the hotel is excellent and they can't do enough to help you. The rooms are very comfortable and I can't wait to go back here one day. Get a 3 or 5 day pass for the cablecars from Walgreen's nearby, that's the most cost effective way of using this most entertaining form of transport. Lori's Diner nearby is really good for breakfast. If you're going to SF, book this hotel. You'll love it.",18-Jan-12,5
"We were in Grand Hyatt San Francisco last December for few nights, but the hotel is nothing beyond the basics, unlike what we expect this type of hotel.",18-Jan-12,3
"We stayed here for a second time and were rather disappointed. We booked a Club Level room primarily to have a quiet place to go after spending the day out in busy SF and for having breakfast. Every time we were in there is was filled with young children and / or teenagers doing what kids do. Parents were using the lounge at night to feed their families dinner. The food offerings were not labeled so you had to continually ask the attendant and seating was limited. The staff in the lounge seemed overwhelmed. Breakfast was so limited the only cereal offered was granola and the only hot entree every day we were there was scrambled eggs with a type of mystery meat in it. This was not our experience during our previous stay. It was not worth the additional expense at all. Housekeeping did a great job in our room each day. Although we love the location of the hotel given the small rooms, high cost and disappointing club lounge I doubt we will return.",12-Jan-12,3
"Were it not for the room noise, I would have given this hotel 5 stars. The rooms are recently refurbished, and are very nice, with excellent bathrooms, great styling and superb views from the upper floors. The location is hard to beat - lots of good restaurants nearby, about a 1 minute walk to the cable cars, handy to transport in general and just a few minutes walk from the huge Westfield mall.Unfortunately the sound insulation between rooms is poor. On the first night we were disturbed several times by a barking dog in an adjacent room, not what you expect in a hotel of this quality. On the last night the guests in an adjacent room were quite loud, and all the noise carried right into our room. This is a great pity as in all other respects, we loved this hotel.",11-Jan-12,3
"I stayed here for a few nights on business and could not have been happier. The location is excellent, right in Union Square, close to Cable Cars, BART, Market St. StreetCar, and good food/shopping. Room size was average, it was very clean, my king bed was very comfortable, and the service at the hotel was top notch. I ordered Chinese take out the day I arrived which was delivered by a local eatery nearby, but they forgot silverware in my bag. I called down to room service with my odd request for a fork and a spoon, and in within what seemed like 2 mins, they sent me up a plate, glass, full set of silverware, and linens to my room. The front desk staff was nice, and I like that I was able to check out using the kiosk to expedite my departure. Computer was available in the lobby to print boarding passes. It seemed really slow, but so be it - I got the convenience I needed. I ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant, GrandViews, which lived up to its name, offering amazing morning views of San Fran, Golden Gate Bridge, and Coit Tower. The food was good, but pricey, and no complaints about the service. When I booked this hotel it was mainly because of location for business, but I'm glad I did, because the location is just one of many reasons why this place was great. I would stay again on my next trip to SFO, and recommend you try it out.",7-Jan-12,5
My wife and I spent one night in a king size - bay view -room up on the 27th floor. We could see the city and the bay from our room which was lovely. The room itslef was very nice. Comfortable and with a pillow menu. We signed up for the amour package and got a champagne and chocolate covered strwberries - breakfast - and late checkout. I thought it was a really nice deal..If driving. park in the stockton garage. Other wise its almost 40 USD a night.Only issue (minor) - noisy neghbors - thinnish walls.,5-Jan-12,4
"I stayed here for two nights and was excellent. Top of the list is the location then followed very closely by the comfortable rooms, well fitted bathrooms, mod cons and mostly great staff. The only negative is the rooms are a bit on the small side and at check-in I had a run in with a receptionist who was not satisfied with identification. I'll put that down to a clash of personalities as the rest of the recpetion and staff were very nice and see no reason to hold the hotel for blame for this as everything else was great.",4-Jan-12,5
"For my family, this hotel represented excellent value. Considering we stayed over the new year period, the pricing was even more astounding.As we are a family of five, two rooms are required. The first room was charged at $220/night. The second room, however, was charged at half-price - $110/night. $330 for two rooms was awesome for us. For the evening of NYE, the rate went up by $50 for the first room, and $25 for the second.Throw in the fact that breakfast was included in the rate, and we had very well-priced accommodation for the NY period. We stayed a total of five nights.Final tip: Use the parking structure on the diagonally-opposite corner of Suttor and Stockton, for reasonably-priced parking in SF.",3-Jan-12,4
Upon arrival very pleasant and efficient front desk promptly check in. Though the room size was smaller but had an excellent view of city and the bay. The hotel location makes it very desirable place to stay. The staff was very helpful. Overall this is an excellent hotel.,3-Jan-12,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco off Union Square just after Christmas. We stayed here about 4 years ago and at least the room we stayed in had been tansformed since the last visit. We enjoyed the hotel before but the new room was beautiful. the full length windows give you an amazing view, Ask for a room as high as possible. If you can upgrade to a club room those are on the higher floors. I used Hyatt points.The after holiday shopping was great and there were sales at all the stores around Union Square.",31-Dec-11,5
We are on our way home but stayed a couple of days here at the Hyatt. No better spot in this city for a central point. No need to make dinner reservations. We had a romantic dinner served in our room set up next to the large windows overlooking the Square. Must be the best dining experience ever! Hyatt's are always nice and clean and great value if you hit the weekends with good discounts.,29-Dec-11,5
"I stayed at the Hyatt during Columbus day weekend of this year for a few days before a business trip began. All of the rooms in the hotel were remodeled and the rooms were really nice. There is a excellent view of the city from the upper floors and the hotel is in walking distance of Union Square, the tram to fisherman's wharf as well as the subway. It is a few blocks away from Chinatown. Cabs are easy to catch from the hotel if you don't feel like utilizing public transportation. For business it is a good hotel. If you are in town for leisure and into clubs/lounges there is a club across the street as well as a club right around the corner. There are also a bunch of small bars & other nightlife places in the immediate area as well. Because of the new room designs and the relatively cheap price as compared to some of the other hotels in the area I would highly recommend this hotel.",27-Dec-11,5
"After staying in many hotels around the world, I can conclude that Hyatt is one of the best big hotel chains out there. For my latest visit to San Francisco, California, I chose the Grand Hyatt again after an amazing experience back in August: Spacious, modern and CLEAN room; amazing staff, nice food. Unfortunately, my recent visit was very dissapointing. My room on the 28th floor was not clean at all. Yu can see the the cleaning service did not do their job well because the batroom toilet had ""residues"" from the guests before me and the bathroom sink was visibly dirty. I would recommend paying more attention to the cleaning and the cleaning service.",27-Dec-11,3
"i planned an event for my company in San Francisco and we stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square. The Lobby is not very open but i understand they are making some changes there. The reno at the hotel was great - the rooms were nicely appointed. We had over 50 people on our room block - this is a great hotel for groups! The sales staff is outstanding and they are very eager to show your group a nice time. They are friendly, professional and responsive and they truly function as a team both in preparation and onsite. The food and service was impeccable. The area is currently undergoing some construction so it can be a bit noisy but that doesn't take away from the hotel at all. if you happen to get rooms overlooking Union Square, you'll seem some great sites both day and night. I recommend it.",27-Dec-11,5
"Paid for standard city view room. Stayed in room 2715 for four days (12/18-12/21/11) with wife and 7 and 4 year-old daughters. Nice view of the city, but not facing the Golden Gate Bridge. The hotel's location for shopping is excellent. One block from cable car access. Used room service daily and was impressed with the efficient service. Tried the restaurant for dinner and breakfast, but service was slow at each (very nice view though.) The room was clean except for a vent intake in the bathroom, near the ceiling, that was covered with mold and lint. The shower pressure was low to medium. There weren't many TV channels for my girls. They were pretty much limited to the Cartoon Channel, which they dont care for. Internet access is a rip-off since it charges a minimum of $9.95 per day PER DEVICE. With 2 iPads, 2 iPhones, and an iPod touch, there was no way I was going to pay that. Fortunately, 3 of the devices were on 3G.",27-Dec-11,4
"Poor Internet, poor shower , good breakfast with excellent view. We stay with a good family rate but if you pay for standard rate, it doesn't worth it. Only worth $150/ day not more than that. Good location. TV channel not enough. I will stay somewhere if I visit San Francisco again.",24-Dec-11,3
"Stayed 2 nights in December. Room: Looks newly updated. Modern, stylish, comfortable. Bathroom: Great big sink, spacious.Staff: Friendly and courteous.Lobby: Kind of small. Don't have Grand Hyatt wow feeling.Club lounge: Too many people and hard to find seats. Location: Right next to Union Sq. and convenient to train, bus, cale car.Overall great hotel and highly recommended.",24-Dec-11,5
"Was at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square from 12-16-2011 to 12-18-2011. Stayed in a non-smoking king room on the 19th floor. This property has been recently remodeled and and it shows: the: the rooms are fresh and the decor is current. The lobby can only be characterized as functional. The staff were as friendly as a major hotel in big city can afford. There are plenty of elevators, so waiting to get to your room is bearable. The rooms are large and comfortable, lots of decent lighting, no coffee maker, poor analog TV. Nice views with handy retractable window shades for privacy. You can still hear all the racket from the street and you can hear your neighbors come and go. The resturant on the 36 th floor is lovely with decent food and service. Free wifi only in selected downstairs areas, otherwise big charge for access in your room. Hotel location very handy for forays into nearby city attractions and then being able to retreat into room when it all gets to be too much. Overall, very decent and, if you shop around a little bit, you can get a decent room with breakfast included for around $160.00 US dollars per night.",22-Dec-11,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt SF for three nights in October. The Grand Hyatt SF is located right next to Union Square. It's a convenient location as it's right near major shopping destinations, Chinatown, and the business district. It is also a close walk to the Port of San Francisco (which is a must if you enjoy good oysters and like a market atmosphere). The hotel is also a block away from the Canal streetcar, which is worth the ride if you've never done it before. The stay itself was very pleasant. The rooms are well appointed and modern, the staff are friendly, and the hotel is cleaner than most in its category. The room is a bit smaller than average, but there was plenty of storage and closet space to make up for it. One recommendation: If you're facing east or west, you will want to put the sunscreen down either in the am or pm, depending on when you get sun. I found that during the afternoon (we were facing west) the sun really heated up the room. Overall, I would definitely return to the hotel. I usually expect quite a bit from a hotel of this class, and they delivered and then some.",22-Dec-11,5
"Our review should have been higher, say 4.4, but as they do in the Olympics, some point-deductions on technicals. Our final rating: 4.1We've stayed many times at this Grand Hyatt, and always enjoyed our stays. The service was good, with comfortable rooms, convenient location, and some good views from our rooms. There was a major refurbishment and updating just completed in 2011 to the entire hotel, updating the rooms, hallways, elevators, etc.. For the most part, it was done well. Color schemes are pleasing and style is more modern, contemporary. The hotel is busy as ever, as we stayed during December ... a week+ before Christmas. Enough generalities, let's go to the details of our review:The Good: The best feature of this hotel is its location. Literally, it is right across the street to the uber-popular Union Square with all its shopping, a short walk to Chinatown, and all other points by taxi/bus/walk. During this time of year, Union Square had an ice-skating rink and Christmas tree put up, making the area even more festive. Getting back to the hotel, the front-desk staff was very friendly, efficient, and accommodating. The rooms have undergone a complete update, including the bathroom, closets, credenza/desk, lights, TVs, etc.. The rooms remain fairly standard size, not large, but not small. The color tones are primarily brown, orange, silver and shades therein, giving it an earth-ier tone. The style is contemporary, Crate & Barrel-ish, with simple lines and minimalist decor. They've added some books and glass vases (glued down of course) on shelves, and vase with long branches to accent, making it warmer and homey(?). New lounge chair + leg-rest/ottomon makes for comfortable seating while reading or gazing out onto SF. The bedding was very comfortable, with a first layer of soft padding. The usual accoutrements are included, such as in-room safe, basic toiletries, good-size credenza/desk to work on, as well as some refinements to others. Specifically, our room had good-sized double-door closets, with built-in drawers, separate dressing area with large mirror, table and chair (for the ladies), and fancy boat-shaped sink in the bathroom. We of course, are grateful for the flat-screen TVs, as we vividly remember the bulky, old TVs a few months back. Also,there is a small refrigerator now, with no more mini-bar. The views were terrific. We stayed in 2 different rooms, due to our request (we noted why below), with one room facing East & South = could see Transamerica building, and downtown financial area, Market St, etc.. The other view was South, which gives tremendous view of Union Square below us and SoMA. See attached pictures.The Bad: As we noted above, some point-deductions on ""technicals"". Although just minor issues, we must include. The first room we were in was generally clean. On closer look, some small issues we noted: the desk chair had brown stains (we're not sure of what, so did not sit on), and found a discarded cough drop wrapper on the lounge chair. It made us think of prior guest being sick, so yuck. Additionally, the fancy sink is pretty to look at, but practically, eh..... had a slow drain and was not very deep for best utilization. The depth made it easier to splash water everywhere when using to wash up. Also, we noted there is no longer glassware with the ice bucket. We were provided only (2) glasses, from the bathroom. This was true for both rooms, but very odd for us, for this level of hotel .. .should be an above-average hotel. We did request to change our room, due to a noisy A/C-heat fan, when it was on auto-high...not so loud when on auto-low. Woke us up a couple of times. Please note: if you get a connecting room, you will hear your neighbors talking, and other noises .. especially if any young kids, including crying, running, talking, etc.. We dealt with it, as not a major issue or on-going. We tested the housekeeper one day by taking the pen from the room, and noticed it was not replaced. I know... you think we're nuts, but we noticed when we changed rooms, and did same, as well as some other hotels, the pen was replaced. This reflects their attention to details. The desk chair in our 2nd room was cleaner, and used it (vs the first room with dirty chair), but noticed it was not very comfortable to sit in, especially for longer than a few minutes. This is probably due to its low back, and we did not see any obvious way to adjust its height. Style over function we guess. Again, all these ""bads"" are not major, in our book ... lead to slight reduction of our rating, but worth noting.Summary: Stay here, whether for business, pleasure, family. It's a very large, corporate/convention/meeting-event driven hotel, but very convenient, comfortable and with refurbishment, modern and stylish ... in a safe kind of way. No wild colors, design eye-poppers, but respectful and soothing. The service is good at front-desk, and housekeeping needs a little refresher on details (may just be one person), but not a major concern. Although we did not utilize room service, we noticed how friendly they were for our neighbors. We recommend this hotel without hesitation ... Enjoy!Happy Hotel-ing !!",20-Dec-11,4
The Grand Hyatt San Francisco stands on Union Square and so is in a great location. It's a very pleasant hotel. My room was clean and nicely furnished. All the staff were very helpful and nice throughout my stay and the concierge was most helpful in finding me a place to purchase emergency eyeglass replacements. My only complaint is that there are really rather few amenities. There is a smallish fitness center on the 35th floor and a rather small bar and dining room on the 36th floor. The view is great but it feels rather cramped. The food was just ok both dinner and breakfast. There's no lobby to speak of and no gift shop to buy even a bottle of water (I walked across the street to Starbucks for that). I've also stayed at the Westin Saint Francis also on Union Square and find that it really has more amenities for the same price. So overall I liked the hotel an can recommend it if you don't mind the lack of amenities.,20-Dec-11,4
"Stayed here 3 nights after two nights at the hyatt regency SF. Really liked the hotel stayed in a suite on 30 something floor. Since we were a family group we booked two large suites with amazing amazing view!wow! Service at high level and excellent concierge. The refurbish was due, but now excellent interiors. The design of the Grand & Regency is rather cool if you'r into contemporary architecture. You will indeed find moore personal hotels but I would stay again for sure. The lounge was comfortable with good selections. Ok gym and excellent to travel here with children.",17-Dec-11,5
"Rooms are nicely renovated but a little small. Breakfast was at top of hotel which had beautiful views of san Francisco. We love the view. Location is good, just a block away from union square where all the shopping is. Reception and bell service was good. However as we needed some help in deciding what to do, the service at concierge wasn't as helpful or friendly. The stay would have been much better if the service we encounter at concierge could be better. Hotel rates considered high for the room size. Would recommend if location is main consideration without regard for room size. ",17-Dec-11,3
"Great hotel by Union square. It is very conveniently located to all retsuarants, attractions and near the convention center. One of the best amenities here is the use of the Regency club. this lounge is open for breakfast and then is open for coffee and soft drinks all day. in the evening there are hors doeurves and drinks (small charge). A lovely hotel",16-Dec-11,4
"Let me first state that the renovated room is very beautiful. You can find all the beautiful features stated in other reviews. These upgraded rooms and the service offered at this hotel are the reasons that I will stay at this hotel again in the future if the rate is acceptable. However, there are some issues during my stay.I booked a room with a conference. The rate was very reasonable and the internet was included for all the conference attendees who stayed at this hotel. The check-in was very quick; got a key but no paper to sign and was told that internet was included. Being a platinum Gold Passport member, I usually got free internet. Thus, I assumed that the hotel did have my GP member. I found it otherwise when I saw the bill before checkout. This also explained that I was not offered an upgrade to a higher floor room. At the night before checkout, I complained to front desk about the slow internet and too-bleached towels. I received a complimentary breakfast for the next morning without asking for. However, I found at checkout that that person did not put this offer on my room. I explained to this different person and was quickly credited for the breakfast. Even though I was assigned to a 10th floor room, the water from the shower is very slow. I did not have this problem in other days when showering before 6:00 am. One more thing is that you should get a breakfast somewhere else if it is not included in your rate. It is expensive (but good views from 36th floor) and the fruits are so so.Why do I give it a five stars? It is the unbeatable location and the service!",9-Dec-11,5
"This is a fine Hyatt hotel â€“ unless the weather is bad â€“ then forget it! The rooms were remodeled in 2010 and 2011 and are typical Hyatt so no issues with that. All have comfortable beds, flat panel TVâ€™s, convenient electrical outlets, wireless internet and so on. I stayed at this property 8 times this year and each stay was fine EXCEPT for my most recent visit. I was on the 26th floor and the wind picked up about 2 in the morning and the room creaked like one would imagine an old wooden sailing ship. It was so loud that sleep was very difficult. I complained to the front desk and they immediately offered to move me to the 7th floor saying that all rooms on high floors had creaking noises when the winds picked up. So, off to the seventh floor I went. But, the next night same issue occurred. I even found a letter from the Front Office Manager in the room. The letter said: â€œDear Grand Hyatt Guest, â€_Due to severe weather conditions and high winds, you may experience intermittent sounds in your guest room. Please be assured, this is common in high-rise buildings shifting with the pressure of the windâ€_..â€ùWhat? Are you kidding me? Wake up, Hyatt - all high rises don't creak in the wind! Bottom line: check the weather forecast before you decide to stay here.",7-Dec-11,3
"I recently attended a conference that was being held at the Grand Hyatt, so for convenience booked a 2 night stay at the hotel. I usually like to stay at boutique hotels for a more personal touch. I was a bit wary that the Grand Hyatt would be like a ""convention center"" type hotel, but had a really wonderful time.  The location is perfect. I was fortunate to get a room overlooking Union square with the Christmas tree and ice-rink in view. Macys, Saks, and Barneys are just down the street and so cute to see the SPCA dogs and cats up for adoption in the windows of Macys. It is a few blocks north of the Montgomery BART stop. The room was spacious, modern and bright. Instead of drapery, there was a button operated window screen. I felt so relaxed. The only thing that I disliked was that one could hear the wind, but I was so tired that once I fell asleep, it wasn't an issue. The restaurant on the 37th floor has panoramic views of the bay and city. Unfortunately the area reserved for happy hour is limited, so it was packed at 5pm. With so many great restaurants in San Francisco including those with Michelin stars, I ended up eating outside the restaurant. I am definitely looking forward to returning to San Francisco and a stay at the Grand Hyatt!",6-Dec-11,4
"This newly refurbished Grand Hyatt is very comfortable, well located, with a professional staff. Accommodations are very contemporary, with clean lines and relaxing colors. Our room was a good size for a city hotel. Every hotel and cruise ship seems to love those duvets on the (very comfortable) bed. They look lovely but are so hot and you can't turn down the thermostat low enough to be comfortable. That aside, I enjoyed having a great choice of pillow comfort on the bed - from soft to very firm - take your pick. Bathroom was clean, comfortable and well-laid out. A small ""dressing"" area was located between the bath and the room, opposite the large closet. There was some noisy construction going on across the street, a higher floor would have been a good choice (at a higher price) another time. This 36 story hotel has a very nice restaurant on the 36th floor with spectacular views, good menu, food, and attentive staff. We had both dinner and breakfast there. Prices were in line with any nice city restaurant. Super Shuttle service from the airport was fast and priced at $17 per person. We look forward to staying at the Grand Hyatt again in the near future.",5-Dec-11,4
"Excellent location for shopping in Union Square, located on the same street as Niketown, Disney Store, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus. However, the central location perhaps is also a weakness, as it is close to the sounds of traffic. I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights for business. The front desk upgraded my room to a higher floor with a better view, which was a nice touch and completely unexpected. My room was right next to the ice machine - I initially worried that it might be noisy, but actually I could not hear any noise in the room, which was great. In terms of outside noise, a slightly different situation. On the first night it was difficult to fall asleep as there were construction sounds going on all night. No issue on the second night. The room and bathroom are spacious and clean, and recently refurbished and so appears very new and modern. The amenities are also very nice. I did use the in-room coffee machine as I didn't have time to run to Starbucks in the morning, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the coffee. The hotel does not provide any complimentary bottles of water, which I found unusual for such a class of hotel such as this one. I would definitely recommend this hotel for tourists or business-people who are visiting SF and would like a central location. I may suggest to request the highest floor rooms possible to have a quiet night of sleep.PLEASE NOTE : The staff at the Grand Hyatt are all very warm, friendly, and prompt. I was very impressed at the speed which the valet retrieved my car from parking and had it ready for me. I also was impressed at how they remembered me and greeted me as I returned back at the hotel. I did not expect this from such a large hotel in a big city. The front desk was equally impressive. A definite positive!",3-Dec-11,4
"My sister and I stayed here in July 2010 during our annual ""Baseball Vacation"" - each year we follow the Yankees to a different away city, see a couple of games and explore a new city along the way. The Grand Hyatt was the perfect base for explorations around San Francisco. Just off Market Street, the convenient location allowed us to walk down Market Street each morning, enjoy a coffee and then head down to Fisherman's Wharf. We loved having access to restaurants, nice stores for shopping and a Walgreen's that became our go-to store each night after sightseeing!The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby is lovely and the concierges are among the best I've encountered. The rooms are reasonably large and we had a very nice view of the city from our windows. Very comfortable beds (this is a key issue for me while traveling) and bedding. The hotel was nice enough to bring a mini-bar fridge up to our room so that we could store drinks and snacks for our five-day vacation. Overall, I was very pleased with the service and accommodations and felt that (for once) the rate was very reasonable. If/when I return to S.F., the Grand Hyatt will be my first choice.",1-Dec-11,4
"The Grand Hyatt had nicely renovated, modern rooms. There are electric shades, which makes waking up easy- just flip the switch built into the headboard for natural light, while still having privacy from the perforated metallic vertical shades. There are plenty of outlets for recharging your electronics, including outlets built right into the headboard, which allows for reading, etc., on your ipad while plugged in. There is a dock/ recharger for ipods built into the clock radio. The minibar was thankfully empty, which meant you could use it without being charged for moving anything. There is a Walgreens nearby for loading up on drinks and snacks inexpensively. That Walgreens even stocks salads and fresh fruit. The bathroom was modern and there was a dressing table area, which was nice. The only thing was that there were eye pencil shavings from the previous guest left underneath it, on the floor, which remained there for my multi day stay, so one is left to wonder how thorough the cleaning is. There were also dried makeup smudges on the makeup mirror on the dressing table which was also not cleaned during my stay.The check-in was fast and courteous; however, I realized afterwards that the rate was different than what I had confirmed online. When I went down to ask why, I was told that I had received some of the paid-for upgrades they now offer online. Okay the extra few $ for a higher floor room; however, I was also charged a hefty upgrade fee for a Club Room, which I didn't receive. I also didn't receive access to the Club Lounge or notification from the check-in person that I had been upgraded. After about 15 minutes, the front desk attendant agreed to remove the upgrade fee for the Club Room. If I hadn't been alert, I would not only have been charged, but also never received either the Club Room or Lounge access. The concierge was very polite and responsive to a recommendation for a good sushi restaurant. When I went there, though, I thought that the sushi was just mediocre. I will trust Tripadvisor and Zagat reviews next time.The location is terrific for pedestrians and a nightmare for cars. It is next to Union Square and shopping and restaurants. It is close enough that you can make multiple trips to the big department stores and back to the hotel to drop off purchases. There is construction going on in the area which, combined with traffic, can lead to long delays in taxis. All in all, with a few minor glitches, the stay was enjoyable, with nice rooms and an unbeatable location for shopping and food.",30-Nov-11,4
"All personnel were extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. Great service from doormen, to check-in, to cleaning staff. Newly redecorated room with flat screen TV. Rewired with easy access to outlets to charge electronic gear, plug in iPod to telephone speaker system, USB port, etc. Unfortunately, room has very little drawer space, which is OK if u are here for 1 night. We were here for a week. Do hotel room designers ever stay in a hotel room? They charge for WiFi access & busn ctr! Seems they are stuck in the 90s. Why is it that lower priced hotels provide these necessities free while more expensive hotels want to nickel & dime u [I mean $5 and $10 u]? Location 1 block N of Union Sq, Macy's, Geary St art galleries, 2 blocks N of Westfield Mall & 1 block W of Gump's is great.",30-Nov-11,4
"Ok it may have been partly due to jetlag but the super large bed at the Grand Hyatt was luxurious! Our room had traditional decor and was spacious with ample wardrobe space, drawer and desk space and coffee machine. Our views were good and if you want a suer view without paying the price for the restaurant just go up to the top floor bar and order .... for me, a cocktail thanks! Was lovely! We did visit the restaurant on the final night of our stay and the view was....clouds mainly! The meal was lovely although priced to match! This hotel has an ideal location and Id suggest that if you are staying even just a few days go for this location over the pier/seafront - you can easily get the wooden cable car right down to the seafront from here. Even better its a quality location with a super ""square"" - Union Square which often has dancing/music on its little stage - nice little benches to sit and watch the world go by. Fantastic shops in the vicinity - Ugg, Tiffany, all the high end ""stores"" to try out makeup, clothing, etc and a super indoor shopping mall with an Abercrombie and Fitch down the road at much cheaper than New York prices! Do try out the cable cars - you really have to experience it! We went to Teattro Zinzanni and it was one of the best theatre/entertainment experiences we have ever had. Do Alcatraz, go on a wine tour - oh theres so much to do I just want to go back! Take clothing to suit any weather as the seafront really can be blowy. Being Scottish I am quite used to it but if you are not, you will feel the chill! Then up at Union Square roasting sunshine! Layers I believe are the way to go! Enjoy San Fransisco!",28-Nov-11,5
"Room is great for price and number of stars. Lobby is cold. Breakfast is very good. Gym is superb, bar at the top is somewhat stylish with great views bud bad service. Location is amazing. Valet parking is expensive but there is cheap alternative across the street.First night the room on lower floor was very noisy (they did get the insulation wrong) so we had to move at 3am to a higher floor which had no problems with noise (rubbish men lingered below our window for more than an hour). Second day the room was not cleaned and we realised at 9pm by which time it was too late for them to clean. They did give us free breakfast (and also offered to waive the rate for one night but our rate was prepaid) .Would give it 4 stars for the price etc. but they lose a star for insulation and bad housekeeping on one day (to be fair the room was spotless for the rest of the days)",28-Nov-11,3
"This hotel has everything you expect from a Grand Hyatt. Nice location. Great rooms. Fun bar. Decent food. Where this hotel stood out was the service. The staff members were very helpful and efficient. I used the concierge A LOT (I don't spend much time in SF, so I had several questions and needed assistance and advice). Every concierge I used was top notch. They were efficient. They were helpful. They were accommodating. They never tried to put me off or discourage me from seeking help (I find some concierges do this ... they try to discourage your use of them by being off-putting). The concierges were great. Even better than the hotel itself ... which says a lot!",28-Nov-11,5
Nice hotel at a great location. However service could be better. At check-in I was told the room they reserved for me was a handicap room and asked if I wanted to change to a different room. I said fine but he ended up giving me a 5th floor room! No view and the drain for the bathtub didn't even work! The electric curtains were nice though.,28-Nov-11,3
"As a diamond member, I would of expected a slightly better service. but I guess being treated as a single guest and looking quite young - there was some form of assessment they got wrong.The food from the upper restraunt was ok, service was ok, and the rooms you guessed it.There was lots of maintenance work going on in the and around the building and I wasn't made aware of that prior to the booking. Next time, I'll try another location.",27-Nov-11,3
"The rooms have been sleekly redone, lots of counterspace and our room was quite large with good lighting. We had a high floor and a view over the city to the bay which was very nice, better than I have had at other SF hotels. The closet was awkward and a little small with little drawer room unfortunately and the bathroom was on the smallish size.Excellent location, only a block from Union Square. The lobby however has few places to sit and is cold and somewhat confusing. Personnel were friendly for the most part but we did not use many of the services.San Francisco is an expensive hotel city and this space is no different. I would however stay again, at least in a view room",27-Nov-11,4
"A very nice weekend stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. The hotel is in a great location, next to all the major shopping in Union Square, most of the live theaters, easy walk to Chinatown, North Beach, Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf.The rooms have been completely remodeled since my last stay two years ago. Very nice rooms, the higher floors have great views of the city.",25-Nov-11,4
Still here writing the review from out crappy room with no view. We are on our honeymoon and the previous three hotels we stayed in made us feel welcome and gave us great room one even gave us a bottle of wine. Check in was average guy was not friendly at all. The last thing you want after a flight from Chicago. This is our last stop before returning to Australia. We were hoping it would e the Best hotel yet. I think if the guy had have cared when we were checking in things may have been better. Our room is small with no view. Staff are friendly but don't go out of their way like the previous hotels. Location is great. The restaurant is ok for breakfast but I would not recommend dinner there. Overall a disappointing last stop. ,25-Nov-11,3
"This is a good but pricey option for tourists not business travelers - i think i did not call to housekeeping as often anywhere I stayed as in this hotel. You need to ask for everything - water, shoe horn (!), vanity set ... I just cant name everything that was not in the room!The seemed refurbished the hotel but not everything - for example the doors remain very old, may be as a consequence you can hear how your next door guest is taking a shower...The breakfast - you don't really want it in the hotel - try to find it outside, even Starbucks will be better and be open earlier then a restaurant in the hotel.Try to avoid if you can...",25-Nov-11,3
"The location of the Grand Hyatt is pretty much perfect - less than 100yds from Union Square, 5 minutes walk from Chinatown, perhaps 15 minutes walk or so to North Beach, and within 2 blocks of the cable car terminus.The hotel is very large, but the service is excellent. I would say that this is obviously a business hotel, but is also great for the leisure traveller if you can secure a decent rate (as we did).Rooms are quite small, especially the bathrooms, but are recently and stylishly refurbished and very comfortable indeed. Every amenity is provided and of good quality. Huge windows (with electric blinds - cool!) offer great views, so be sure to try to get a room on a high floor, preferably with bay or Union Sq view.The restaurant and bar on the top floor afford magnificent views of the bay, and have a great atmosphere.There is valet parking or assisted self service at nearly garages, but expect to pay a minimum of $34/night for the latter (and over $50 I think for valet). If you don't need a car whilst in SF, it may be better to collect from a downtown location on your departure from the city.My only suggestions for improvement would be:WiFi - come on, even basic roadside inns now offer this free and this was the only hotel in my week long trip that charged.I enjoyed my stay at the Grand Hyatt and would highly recommend.",23-Nov-11,5
"This was a beautiful, classic hotel. The rooms have some amazing views of the city, but also feature electric shades that will completely block out all the light for when you're ready to sleep. Pretty good sized rooms for the price. Very high quality and clean!Great customer service. Will print your plane tickets home for free. In a great location -- far enough away from the Fisherman's Wharf that it doesn't feel too, too touristy, without being too far to walk to attractions. Only two complaints: - The business center that they advertise is NOT free. You must pay to use their two, extremely slow, computers. Had I known I would've brought my own laptop for when I needed to look up attractions.- They have this auto HVAC unit... I'm not sure if ours was broken but it must have been motion sensored because when we would go to sleep it would completely shut off and then every time one of us would move or get up to use the bathroom it would kick on and then shut off 5 minutes later. Extremely disruptive.",23-Nov-11,4
"My wife and I stayed here for our 10 yr anniversay. Neither of us had ever been to SF so it was nervous to book not really knowing the city. After reading other reviews that talked about location, I booked and so glad I did. We looked at other cheaper hotels but so very happy we decided to book at the Grand Hyatt. This was our 10 yr anniversay and Glietz at the Front Desk made us feel welcome from the get go. They upgraded our room to a higher floor with a awesome city view. They also offered us a bottle of wine and choice of a food item. Nice touch and very much appreciated. There are plenty of staff in the lobby area ready to assist with any needs. The Concierge was very friendly and helpful. It rained most of the weekend and they even offered us the use of an umbrella the entire weekend. This might be the norm for a 4 or 5 star hotel but i had never experienced this before and it was very much appreciated. It kept us dry while we walked around the entire city! Right next to plenty of shopping, Chinatown or a Cable car or Street Car. I did read some reviews about street noise but i guess that would be common in a ""City"" type of atmosphere with tall buildings echoing sounds. I don't have any complaints about the hotel. The rooms were very nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. I didn't realize there was a small fridge or coffee maker in the room until the day we checked out but oh well. Starbucks is directly accross the street.North Beach (Italian neighborhood is with in walking distance) We ate breakfast at Lori's a block away from the hotel and it was very good. I recommend Tony's Pizza in North Beach. Very good pizza!We stayed 2 days and could not get it all in. If you stay on pleasure, it is worth the Open Air Bus tour of the city. It hits all the major sites and you can get on and off at your leisure. And the price is reasonable.Thank you to all the great staff that made our stay such a nice and memorable one! Perfect Location too!",21-Nov-11,5
"The Grand Hyatt is on the nicer end of Hyatts. There are plenty of people working in the lobby, so employees are always available, helpful and friendly. The rooms were reasonably stylish. It's not the quietest hotel, but it is right in the middle of the city and it's not bad. The room and bathroom were not huge, but comfortable enough. It doesn't have a wow factor, so to help you expect the right thing I'd say that it's a clean city hotel, some trendy elements, and nicer than most Hyatts. I was staying for business and it was perfect. It's a short walk (maybe 4 blocks) from the Powell Street public transport station (both Bart and Muni), so getting to other parts of the city or the airport is fairly easy. Plus the hotel has bellmen (bell people?) to get cabs.",20-Nov-11,4
"Having just spent a long weekend at the Grand Hyatt Union Square there are certainly a lot of great things about this hotel - the staff, the view and the location, but a few things let down the hotel for us.I had Hyatt points to spend, so I booked three nights for my family of 2 adults and 2 kids (8 and 10) in a Club room. I had thought (mistakenly) that the rooms with two beds were king/king - so on arrival I was very surprised to find that the rooms were actually double/double and in fact - tiny. We had an adjoining King room for other family members and the King, same size as the double, really seemed a lot roomier. To the hotel's credit my husband spoke with a member of staff who showed him a number of different rooms and allocated us a Bay view room for our 2nd and 3rd nights, with a complementary bottle of wine for the inconvenience, but the room was still the same small size. Bathrooms are also small but well fitted, big sink, modern fittings - but the shower is over the bath, even on the Club rooms. The hotel has no real lobby to speak of but the decor around the hotel is updated, modern and very clean.The Club dining room has a fabulous view of San Francisco and the Bay - and the staff in the evening were incredibly polite and helpful. Wine is self-service on an 'honor' system for $3 per glass and staff ordered a very reasonable bottle of bubbly for us on the first night. The food in the Club was ok, but compared to other Hyatt Clubs (or the Ritz Clubs) was only really average. Breakfast was mostly pastries and fruits and a different dried up egg dish each day. In the evening two appetizers were served with a block of cheese (that was not renewed). Soft drinks and coffee/teas were amply supplied.The location of the hotel is great, just a short walk from the BART station, a cable car stop and within a stone's throw of major shopping, restaurants and Union Square.All-in-all great staff, great view - still tiny room!",19-Nov-11,4
"Stayed here late Oct 2011, for sister's weekend birthday celebration. Hotel was sold out while we where there but check-in was friendly & easy; desk clerk was very helpful getting us 2 nearby rooms on same floor, both with excellent city views. Status upgrades were also given from standard to high floor deluxe, with Club room access. Newly renovated rooms are very nice; king corner rooms are quite spacious with separate dressing area from room & large bath. Really liked the new decor & modern tech amenities (all is very much like their website photos & descriptions.) Excellent AC - was quite hot for SF at that time of year.Hotel valet parking is reasonable for SF but directly across the street is parking garage that is $26 for 24 hrs; so drop your bags with bellman & then park it yourself.",18-Nov-11,5
"This is a pretty fancy hotel right in downtown San Francisco. The rooms are pretty small, but beautifully done in a the ""moderne"" minimalist style. The flat screet TVs are a waste since they only have analog low res quality and only a handful of channels. Internet is not free, not even in the business center. No coffee maker or fridge. Good location right on the edge of Chinatown and close to everything.",17-Nov-11,4
"The Hyatt is simply the perfect choice for any traveller to San Francisco. I loved our suite, it had a balcony overlooking the bay, two bathrooms (one even had a flat screen tv !!) the living room had a huge TV and my kids loved our 5 day stay. The hotel lobby was beautiful, the staff very helpful and even upgraded one of our rooms. There was wi fi everywhere, the gym was well positioned and the views were great !!! It was a great great holiday !!",16-Nov-11,5
"This hotel was a great place to stay while we were in San Francisco! We were there for a food festival and everything was so convenient for all of us. A few went one way and the others scattered in the several directions to sight see. Great view, from our 16th floor window, of all of Union Square and the bay!! I would definitely stay here again!",14-Nov-11,5
"We loved our room at the Grand Hyatt. It was spacious and clean with a nice view of downtown. The bed was so comfortable. The concierges were also fantastic. They were able to arrange for a last minute rental car for us as well as give us some great guidance about our destinations of Sausalito and Muir Woods.Small issues were that the first night it was windy so the building was creaking - nothing the hotel could do about this and it didn't end up keeping us up like we had feared it would - so not too big of a deal. Also, the window shade is controlled by switches next to the bed and door. I must have put it up to far when we got in to the room because when we tried to put it down when we got back it jammed. The hotel sent someone up very quickly to resolve the issue.Due to a business trip and room availability we stayed in 3 different hotels while in San Francisco. This was the first and we just kept wishing to come back to this hotel.",14-Nov-11,5
"I just returned from a 5-night stay at this lovely hotel in San Francisco's Union Square. The hotel is very nicely situated in the heart of Union Square, just steps away from all the shopping and great restaurants this neighborhood is known for. It's also just a few blocks from Chinatown, and a metro/bus ride to almost anywhere in the city. I was in town for a conference at the Moscone Center, which was an easy 8-minute walk away. The location is one of the best features of this hotel.The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are very comfortable, with modern decor and lots of great practical elements like a big desk, lots of easy to reach outlets and internet connections (and not just at the desk, but next to the bed as well), and a very nice bathroom with one of the best lit mirrors I've seen (great for makeup application). The view from my room was great- mostly city, with peeks of the bay behind the buildings. I would highly recommend you try to get a bay-view room on as high a floor as possible for the best view. The only issue I ran into during my stay was the lack of sound insulation in my room. There was a connecting door with the adjacent room, which was closed the entire time, but which let a surprising amount of noise from the other room into mine (and vice versa I imagine). I could hear conversations from the other room clearly from mine, and I did feel a bit self conscious that everything that I was saying could be heard by my neighbor as well. It didn't bother me enough to switch rooms, but if you're a light sleeper or are bothered by this, I would request a room without a connecting door. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. The service was great (super fast room service), the rooms were very comfortable, the restaurant on the 36th floor had spectacular views, and the location is really ideal. I would definitely return to this hotel, and would recommend it highly to others.",8-Nov-11,4
"Travelled to SF in July 2011 with my sister.This hotel is spectacular. We requested a double room very early on, a high floor and a renovated room - they gave us all 3.The rest of the hotel, e.g. the bar and the lobby, needs updating to bring it in line with the rooms.The hotel is ridiculously central. 5mins from China Town, another 10 mins from China Town to North Beach. So very central to everything else - like the shops around Union Sq. It's close to all kinds of cafes and restaruants too, and a stroll away from Zara/H&M/Levis/T&Co. The service is great and the concierges were ridiculously helpful with directions to EVERYTHING! They helped us with public transport, bus routes, cable cars etc. No need to feel like a novice / research your trip with concierges like this! Although they did give us one bad restaurant recommendation in North Beach.",5-Nov-11,5
"Had a pleasant stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco. Was in town for the Nike Women's Marathon and this hotel is steps away from Union Square. Upon check-in, I was offered a room on a high floor with stunning views of the bay, but unfortunately, the room was next to an ice machine. I am sensitive to noise, so reluctantly I asked if I could be switched to another room. Fortunately, they were able to offer a similar room on a high floor with a great city/partial bay view, and the staff member made an extra effort to show me access to an unbostructed view of the city and the bay. Nice touch. Room is not large, but this being a business hotel, layout is practical and convenient. Had access to the Regency Lounge and this premium amenity is a nice luxury! Full breakfast buffet in the mornings, dessert pastries in the evenings, plenty of beverage options, honor bar for wine and liquor, all while enjoying gorgeous views of the city. A pleasant stay overall. Would consider coming back here again.",5-Nov-11,4
"Please note: this review is from my stay in an Executive Suite, and may not be 100% applicable to the hotel in general.Room: The Executive Suite was excellent. It contained a spacious bedroom and a separate business / living room area with a couch, chair, TV, and plenty of desk space. The bed was very comfortable. One of the best features was that the suite had two full bathrooms, which I found very handy for getting ready in the morning. Our room faced east, with some decent views into the Bay.Location: The hotel is located a block north of Union Square, which serves as an excellent location for tourists. It is only a block away from the famous cable car line and a few blocks away from the south end of Chinatown. Most of the public transportation options are available within a few blocks, with a BART station a few blocks south an a number of bus lines in the area, making it very easy to get to all areas of the city and the airport.Service: The service at the hotel was very good. The staff were generally friendly and helpful. The hotel also has the very convenient Hyatt system for checking into your flight and printing tickets.The only downside was that the in room internet did not initially work. However, the hotel staff was very helpful in getting the problem fixed, even offering a bottle of wine and some snacks as an apology.",5-Nov-11,5
"Located bang at union square the out appearance isnt very great but once you're in the hotel its a totally different world......when i checked in I got a room facing the other side (of union square) and spent a night there but there were some quirky noises coming for some reasons and one complaining the same I was given a room on a higher floor facing the union square which was truly a great experience. Also, they kind of surprised us when we returned back in the evening to find a nice bottle of wine and freshly cut fruits as a courtesy.....didnt try any of the restaurants in the hotel but i will never forget my stay here....3 cheers!",4-Nov-11,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt last week for a conference. Room was very clean and loved the remote blinds feature. What was the best part about the hotel? The concierge desk went above and beyond with suggestions and recommendations that absolutely made our ""off time"" great! Simply stopped by to get directions for a good place to eat dinner and ended up going to the opening night of the Broadway play ""Hair"", front row seats, for a great price thanks to the wonderful concierge desk! In my opinion, this kind of service is what sets this hotel apart from the rest.",3-Nov-11,5
"Very large hotel, with friendly staff. Right in the center of Union Square and easy to get to from SFO via the BART train ($8 train trip as opposed to a $50 cab ride). Easy to walk to many great places in San Fran, including lots of hills. The rooms were lovely, clean and amazing views of the city and/or bay. The only negative was noise that made it hard to sleep. Of course there's city street noise, nothing can be done about that. However, the first night I was in a room that was a ""connecting room"" and I could hear my inconsiderate, loud neighbors as if they were in the room with me. The second night I changed rooms and heard a loud mechanical noise all night long that I imagine was the elevator. Bring ear plugs and all will be perfect.",3-Nov-11,4
"I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights in September and had a wonderful time. I requested for a room without bath tub as I am pregnant and did not want to risk climbing in and out. They very nicely gave me a room on the club floor - 32nd. Although it did not face Union Square, it was nicely renovated, clean and comfortable. The beds were awesome - very soft and big. There was ample space in the room for laying out our luggage and a lounge chair as well.Location is fantastic. Right off Union Square and 2 blocks from Chinatown. Transport was a breeze - cable car around the corner, muni buses nearby. Loads of shopping and food options just minutes away.My rate came with in-room internet, but for those who don't want to pay, there are so many free wifi spots! Right outside the hotel is Starbucks.There is no fault I could find with the Hyatt. It made my babymoon a memorable and lovely vacation.",3-Nov-11,5
"My husband and I recently extended a business trip to San Francisco into a short vacation, and stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Stockton Ave. It was a great experience. The room was modern, large enough for our comfort. The staff was very helpful. The location was great--just across the street from Union Square. A great value, particularly since the rates we got through Trip Advisor were better than I was quoted by our local travel agent. I highly recommend it. Our next trip to SF will include a stay at the Grand Hyatt.",1-Nov-11,5
"Just stayed at the fully remodeled Grand Hyatt in SF last weekend and really liked the new look of the rooms. We had a room on the 24th floor with views of the Starlight room and the city. The room was a generous size with a great bed, good linens, Ipod docking station, marble bathroom, etc. My sisters corner room on the same floor was even larger with a separate dressing area. The bar & restaurant on the top floor has excellent views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Coit Tower and the Bay. I live in the Bay Area and have to say this is one of the best views in the city. The easy parking across the street at the Stockton Street garage was $26 for 24 hours (no in or out). The Grand Hyatt is on the corner above Union Square so shopping, great restaurants, Theaters, etc are all easy walking distance. The main entrance to Chinatown is one block away. A car is not needed unless you want to go out to the DeYoung Museum, etc.",1-Nov-11,5
"Spent 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt, SF. Rooms have been completely re-done and are VERY nice. Super comfy king beds, nice large flat screen TV's, and very modern. The lounge on the 36th floor offers great views for drinks in the evening and then again at breakfast. Close to everything. Staff was great and very helpful.",1-Nov-11,5
"I recently stayed for 5 nights on a holiday with my mother. The hotel was terrific from check in to check out. We had a georgeous room on the 25th floor, newly renovated with top notch ammenities. Being on the 25th floor we did not find noise to be an issue, and we never had to wait for an elevator. The location is superb right in the heart of Union Square, close to shopping, restaurants, streetcars and cablecars. The concierge desk was fantastic about giving us tips and pointers on what to do in SF. I would highly recommend this hotel, and would be happy to stay again at the Grand Hyatt SF.",31-Oct-11,5
"We spent a long weekend here recently and were very pleasantly surprised, Since our last visit, the rooms have been updated, new and better beds installed, and an overall facelift was conducted with excellent results. Anyone visiting SF or the first time should strongly consider staying in the Union Square area. First, it is arguably the city's center and close to everything, including the iconic cable car (literally one block from this hotel). Second, one is within walking distance of Chinatown, great restaurants and shopping. Buy an all-day pass if you take the cable car as it can be used on the city's excellent bus system.",31-Oct-11,4
"great room, I was on the 10th floor (not the best view I would say) for the nike womens marathon. Union square is pretty much right out the door. great shopping near by. Public transporation was easy to get to and get around with. The conceirge desk was extremely helpful in directing to activties, places to eat and transporation. the bed alone will make you never want to leave very comfortable.",31-Oct-11,5
"Newly renovated room was great - modern and clean with a huge bathroom. This is a very convenient location with Starbucks right across the street, Union Square and shopping all around and easy access to Chinatown. The gym is also a standout. It has all of the expected cardio machines, which by the way, offer an amazing view from the 35th floor. In addition, it has a lot of free weights, exercise balls, mats, etc. The only reason I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lobby is nothing special. There's really no place to sit and visit. Also, the choice of bars and restaurants within the hotel is very limited. There is a bar/restaurant on the top floor with spectacular views. However, the menu is limited and pricy. There are many fine restaurants and bars within walking distance, though.",31-Oct-11,4
"i recently stayed here for 6-day business trip. I was given a corner room on 17th floor - #1708. While i loved my stay, comfy, cozy.. having starbucks across the street, union square 1-block away, macy's cheesecake factory and rice-a-roni trolley cars, the one negative is that dam whistle. Oh well, someone has to keep earplugs in business.Definitely check out the AMAZING gym on the 35th floor (turn left and go thru doors to get into gym). Also, must have drink on the 36th floor - little pricey but awesome views.Enjoy!",30-Oct-11,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt the second week of October, 2011 with my husband and 4 year old son. I had stayed here years ago and must say that the renovations are amazing. The hotel interior is stunning. If you are into the ultra modern style - this is the place for you. Our room was on the 32nd floor club level and was gorgeous. It was not huge, but we had laminate floors and a view of the bay. The bathroom lacked a tub which I always wish for, but I think space is limited in these tower like hotel structures in the city. The bathroom was ultra modern with the raised sink and plentiful Portico toiletries. The bed was very comfortable. The flat panel TV and all amenities were perfect, including the electric sun shade on the ceiling to floor windows, and modern bed lamps attached to the bed posts. They delivered a DVD player for our son at no charge.The problems: Oh Boy! We picked a terrible time to go there since they had an employee strike every day that we were there. The employees were shouting (no screaming) on the street level - and we could hear it from our room on the 32nd floor up until 10pm!!!! It was terrible! They actually even ran into my husband on two separate occasions when we exited the hotel! They shouted at us not to check in on the 1st day too. They kept crossing the line that was drawn out for them on the pavement. It was very rude and unruly!The DVD Player took 2 hours to arrive at our room. The front desk lied to us - (as admitted by their own engineer who said he told them he could not find a DVD player and was looking for one). They told us he would be there in 10 minutes. Well try explaining the lies to a 4 year old 2 hours later as we are stuck waiting in the room! The room service was not the greatest either. This was obviously an exception since we have never had this kind of problem in the past - and they were seriously low on staff with everyone picketing outside. They should have just been honest about things. We also got our room 2 hours after we arrived with the manager's apologies. The club lounge was wonderful. It had private areas to get work done, have a private meeting or just relax. It is beautifully designed. The breakfasts were delicious, as well as the evening snacks and drinks. We also had dinner at the GrandViews Restaurant. They have a breathtaking view, and the service was wonderful. They were extremely accomodating in finding us a perfect table. We had invited another family to have dinner with us. The food was extremely disappointing though. I am not a picky eater, but the pasta was like simple boiled pasta with canned tomato stew on top, and the fish dishes were embarrassing! If you read my other reviews you will see that I can eat at the Four Seasons or McDonalds - again I am not picky, BUT the food we were served was truly pathetic. We were in a great location with good friends and good service, so I never complained. The location of the hotel is PERFECT! We were close to everything. The friendly concierge helped us with all reservations including the open top blue bus tour for 2 days which enabled us to see and tour everywhere.. Whether you are into shopping, dining or touring - this is the location to be. Absent the strike of the employees - we were very happy and would return in a heart beat!",29-Oct-11,4
"I was ther with twenty clients. They all loved the place/decor/breakfasts,location and atmosphere. It was a first class stay. A tram stops nearby and for 75 cents senior citizens can travel a very long way, It was safe enough at night to walk around.",27-Oct-11,5
"We had a king size bed on the 6th floor. The room was very modern. The washroom pieces were very modern. The shower head could not be adjusted to spray water out to the middle of the tub. I had to bend my head right next to the wall to get wet.The room was small but acceptable. The view was poor. We looked out at the side of a white building. The was a french balcony, but the sliding door could not open.The room was clean and quiet. We found the mattress was too soft. It caused some back aches.The internet was under $20 per 48 hours which is pretty standard.The gym was on the top floor and had a great view. It was a 1st class gym with very good equipment. There is no extra cost for the gym.The housekeeping was good and the front desk staff was fine. The kids loved the candies that were at the front desk. There was a housekeeping strike while we were there, but it did not affect us.Parking is scary expensive. Its in a building across the street.The location of the hotel is ideal. There are lots of shops and restaurants right at the door.Market street,Macy's,Saks,Union square are less than a 5 minute walk away.",23-Oct-11,4
"Stayed at the hotel for a work event in October. Large room, great design, very comfortable. I liked the design so much I took some pics for decorating ideas at home. Staff were helpful and prompt. Great location as well. We have stayed at the Westin St Francis in the past and the Hyatt is considerably nicer in my book.",22-Oct-11,5
"I found the service impeccable, from valet service, to entering the lobby, to checking in, to being shown the way to the elevators, to everyone in the restaurant and lounge. I was surprisingly pleased with how modern the room was -- very nice. It included electrically-controlled blinds, headboard with reading lamps, and very stylish hardware in the bathroom.",22-Oct-11,5
We loved the modern yet natural decor. Super cozy and comfy beds. Beautiful modern bathroom Friendly staff,21-Oct-11,4
"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Loved it!Recently renovated rooms provided comfortable beds and decor, lovely modern bathroom; albeit the shower pressure was poor and merely trickled water- not an issue in the slightest really. The size of the rooms were also good.The staff here were incredibly friendly and always went out there way to help us.Would recommend the rooftop bar, great food and drinks and reasonably priced.The location of the hotel is simply fantastic and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it.",21-Oct-11,4
I liked the hotel and the rooms and lobby were modern and new. Do not miss the floor from the top floor.. absolutely great. There are only few smallish reasons this hotel did not get 4 or 5 stars. First and foremost there were sewer vapors coming from one of the bathroom fixtures resulting a quite foul odor. As long as I kept the bathroom door closed the rest of the room was okay. Price was another issue. We had a group corporate rate for a function being held in the hotel. Despite this we still paid what I would have consider to be top dollar. Other than that the stay was great. The bed was one of the best I have come across in a hotel.,21-Oct-11,3
"Stayed at this hotel for a conference at the convention center... having stayed at several downtown San Francisco hotels over the last year for various conferences I can say that this hotel was excellent. 4 people working the check in on a very busy weekend. The Nike womens marathon was happening down the street and the Hyatt was one of the main hotels. Check in was smooth and seamless. My room was ready at noon and early check in was no problem. The room was clean and spacious, plenty of room for our bags in the closet. King bed with 6 pillows, desk area, sitting chair with ottoman, nice bathroom, very clean and well maintained, large closet for bags. Room was a standard king room, the bed extremely comfortable and came with a mini fridge, and coffee maker. The floor to ceiling windows gave us a wonderful view of the park where the marathon stuff was going on and the view of the city at night was breathtaking. Our room was cleaned every day promptly and nothing was stolen or ""misplaced"". The hotel restaurant has good food and a killer view of the bay. The service is excellent but as you suspect a little pricey, but most things are in San Francisco! Worth going up for cocktails at night their bar area is hopping with the best views of the city, and they make killer drinks!Doormen are very exceptional, hailing cabs, giving directions, and in general being interested in making your stay excellent!!Room service- on time and food was hot.Only detraction from this hotel is that wi-fi is NOT free.Overall I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",21-Oct-11,5
"My family and I stayed here for 6 nights. I used a suite upgrade and was given an awesome hospitality suite on the 32nd floor with views to the east. The room was nicely appointed and clean. The one bad thing the suite had no bath tub. I asked the front desk about this as I was traveling with an 11 month old and later that afternoon a Hyatt employee knocked on our door with a baby bath tub filled with toys and accessories. AWESOME! The location is great too, walking distance to everything and great public transportation.",20-Oct-11,5
"Remodeled room was excellent and comfy. They put me in handicap accessible room without asking me first. I hate when they do that. Those high toilets are uncomfortable. The elevators are really slow, couldn't figure out why. The dining room on the 36th floor was decent for breakfast and reasonable for what goes these days. The front desk was mostly helpful, but sometimes copped an attitude. For such a nice place, they need to finish getting their act together.",20-Oct-11,4
"Stayed here five nights on business.The good:Very very clean room, just renovated; clean, modern decor with starched white high count linens. Neutral wood, tan/orange colors with just enough touches to make it not sterile, but not so much that it's overpowering. I had a corner room, which was quite spacious for SF for the price. On the 21st floor, I didn't have any noise problems, except the rare noise when my neighbors came in and out of their rooms -- I could definitely hear that. Otherwise, it was very quiet. I slept well every night. There are two power outlets built into the bedside tables in a convenient location on each side of the bed; extra airline-style positionable reading lights. Lots of new white good size towels. The refrigerator is a nice touch; no mini-bar, but you can bring home leftovers from dinner. There are bedside controls to raise and lower the black-out shades -- it was pitch-dark at night (except for the clock-radio/phone), and it was nice to raise the shades and see the city-scape in the morning before getting up. Service was polite without being cloying. Nice bath amenities -- I tip housekeeping well, but I got extras every day. The bathroom was spacious; the bathroom door was opaque glass, and it slides open/closed -- the effect creates extra space. The elevators were very fast; I never waited more than a minute, going up or down.One minor critique -- the sinks are shaped like a baby's bath, with a shallow end to the left away from the faucet; very attractive, but not practical.The ONLY thing that keeps me from giving this hotel a 5 is the following: the internet service is not free, and the WiFi is painfully slow and erratic. I've been using the wired connection instead all week. I truly object to high-end hotels charging for WiFi. Kimptons have always provided free wifi, and it's one of the reasons I'm loyal to them.Otherwise, great stay in a comfortable, clean, modern, upscale hotel.",18-Oct-11,4
"This hotel is perfect in terms of it's location. The gym is up to date with new equipment and has an amazing view of downtown San Francisco from the 35th floor. The restaurant on the 36th floor has great food and an even better panoramic view. The rooms were a touch on the small side, but we only needed it for sleep so it wasn't a problem for us. The front door men were always so friendly, accommodating and knowledgable. This hotel was very central and at max. a 10 minute cab ride to anywhere we wanted to go. The housekeeping staff were very friendly. We really enjoyed our stay.",16-Oct-11,5
"We stayed here for two nights in Oct 2011. While this hotel has been updated recently, you can tell it's a bit aged underneath it all. Our room was very comfortable, except for the constant construction surrounding Union Sq, which our room overlooked. We're talking 2:30 a.m. construction noise. Yeah, we were not impressed at all! If you are staying here after construction has finished (no idea when that will be, it's a big project) then you'll probably be happy. Until then, make sure they do not put you in any of the rooms overlooking the square. After calling down at 2:30 they offered to comp our bar charges, which was nice, but the issue remains for the next guest and the next. We gave them 4/5 here because of the quick response to the complaint, and because they very kindly let us store bags with them for an afternoon/evening two days after we checked out. That was really fantastic. Also, taxis were a slight pain because consutrction made the area a mess, and depending on which direction you were going it could be slow. Sometimes it was better to walk a block or so and catch one on the next street up to avoid sitting in traffic for a long time.",16-Oct-11,4
"I recommend the Grand Hyatt to anyone going to San Fran. The accommodations are very current, the staff is exceptional, and the location couldn't be better.This hotel is perfect for personal or business",16-Oct-11,5
"I stayed at the hyatt for almost a week. The location is great and the concierge and front desk try their best. When I made the reservation it mentioned 5 stars; but: roomservice is not available 24 hoursminibars are emptyhousekeeping is very slow and not very detailedI am truly disapointed, I have stayed at other hyatt properties and the service is trully 5 stars.I feel I was charged a 5 star price for a 31/2 star service.",15-Oct-11,2
"Lovely, comfortable and perfectly situated at Union Square. You can walk most places or take the trollies and tour busses that stop at the Square. We were on the 32nd floor. Restaurant and work out rooms are on the higher floors so you won't miss the breathtaking views even if your room is lower. Prepare for sticker shock. At less expensive hotels you can expect free wi fi, breakfast and parking. Here you can expect to pay $75/day for these three things in addition to $300+/day for the room itself unless you're on a lower floor. There was a union organized walk out complete with picketers, blowing horns and megaphones at the main entrance when we arrived however we couldn't imagine any better service than what we received and the show outside had entertainment value. For me the experience was worth every penny. This was a business trip that my husband and I combined with extra days for pleasure.",15-Oct-11,5
"we arrived very early in the morning after a night flight from hawaii and did not expect to be able to check in early, but the gentlemen behind the desk said our rooms were ready and not a problem. Our room was great with fantastic views of the city with floor to sealing windows, the bed was amazing and just what we needed after a 7hr flight with no sleep.the room is a very good size and the bathroom was well appointed and they had nice touches like complimentary toothpaste. The first morning we ventured out it was raining so we asked for an umbrella which was no problem we had a choice of large or small again a very nice touch. The bar on the 36th floor has the most amazing views of the city and is well worth a visit at sundown although i think the drinks are a bit expensive it was $28 for two cocktails and $36 for a bottle of wine, but a guess this is on par with most other large city's.the hotel is in a good location and a 30min walk from the fisherman's wharf and china town is just 5mins away. i will definitely be staying at this hotel again",15-Oct-11,5
"Our room was very nice; however, we had to ask for a kingside bed as they had booked us into 2 doubles, despite our reservation. The hotel just underwent renovation and updates and it is apparent as soon as you enter the actual room. We had a corner room which was spacious, minimal, and clean. The refrigerator is a nice touch as well. The lobby needs work. There are very few places to sit and wait for people or rides & in a city of this size, many people are traveling with family or groups. There are no bathrooms available on main lobby floor & the restrooms downstairs were crowded due to conference attendees. Desk staff is, for the most part, not to friendly & seem to want to just get you to move on, even when slow. Baggage staff not much better, & though there are considerate staff, they are overshadowed by the others. The location is very good..great shopping, convenient transportation, and great restaurants.",14-Oct-11,3
"You can't ask for more. The Hyatt is centrally located, in Union Square, a block from the cable car stop, a few blocks from BART and on several main bus routes. The rooms were gorgeous. Recently renovated, we were completely impressed by the decor and spent a little too much time mesmerized by the window shades that were controlled by a button in the end table. Room also came with a minifridge (no mini bar, which I prefer because then you can't fit anything into the fridge!) We were also very excited by the view, until we were told about the restaurant on the 36th floor. Amazing!!! I didn't have too much interaction with the staff, but the little I did was wonderful. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. I'm trying hard to think of a negative to add, and am struggling to think of one. I'm not someone who gives 5 stars out easily, so please know that I was very impressed and would most definitely go back.",14-Oct-11,5
"The newly-renovated Grand Hyatt was clean, comfortable, welcoming, and perfectly located. The newly-renovated rooms are stylish and warm. The staff was helpful at all times, even with three demonstrations happening on their doorstep. The bar on the 36th floor had an incredible view and was an excellent way to end a long day out sight-seeing. An even better end to a long day was the luxurious, king-sized bed! It was like slipping into a cloud every night and made it hard to get up and start the next day. We just wanted to stay in that bed!",13-Oct-11,5
"We have spent quite a bit of time traveling this summer. We have been up and down the California coast as well as Canada. This stay was a gift from our best friends and included golf at Harding Park. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. Much too early for checking into our rooms. Our hope was to valet our car and leave our bags with the bellman. We were greeted by an enthusiastic bellman who quickly unloaded all our bags and valeted our car. To our amazement we were told our rooms were ready and we were able to go straight up!!!Our rooms were immaculate. The view stunning. But the COMFORT of our room was by far the most superior of any hotel room we have stayed in. The mattress was wonderful with pillows to match. Towels were lush and thick. The shower was well appointed and water pressure was great.There is noise from the street, but you are in Union Square in San Francisco!!! We were able to walk to Mortons Steak House for an awesome dinner. Shopping all day in Union Square was great. Breakfast one day was room service and the next day was at the Cheesecake Factory in Macy's....a 4 minute walk across Union Square.Can't remember a better time in SF and the October sunshine was perfect.",13-Oct-11,5
We stayed for 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt. We had a great view of the skyline and the bay.We were celebrating a birthday that weekend and the Hyatt sent us a complimentary bottle of wine and food platter the 1st night. That kicked off 4 great days. We were lucky and caught a fleet week air show over the bay and a Columus Day Parade in North Beach. The rooms have been updated since we were here in 2008 and the Hyatt did a great job. The room was very clean and the front desk was very helpful. It is a great location and good hotel,13-Oct-11,5
"Location is excellent and the views from the Grandview Restaurant and Lounge are breathtaking. The recent renovation is well done- love the remote control windowshade and the babybath size sink. We were on a lower floor- room 606 and unlike other reviewers weren't bothered by noise of neighbors and fully expect to hear city noises in a city.Prices in the Grandview lounge are relatively reasonable for a bar menu that equates to lunch-size portions. Wish that there were a couple more eating options like a coffee/breakfast/snack bar. Also there aren't any vending machines in the hotel, so hard to grab a bottle of water or a soft drink before setting out for a day of sightseeing.",13-Oct-11,4
"The location is great. The rooms are extremely nice and well appointed. The only complain would be the noise. The walls are paper thin. We could hear everything in the hallways every time someone was near our room. Street noise was also bothersome, but likely due to our being on a low floor. Overall, it's a good hotel if you go the Priceline route, but not worth the standard rate compared to other hotels in the area.",12-Oct-11,3
"Surprisingly good experience at this large hotel right off Union Square. Set at the top of Stockton Street and surrounded by great shopping and dining, this is the choice among the big chain hotels in the downtown/financial district area at this service category. The staff are very curteous and pleasant, from the reception desk to the concierge team. The rooms, though not large, have been nicely and comfortably renovated and feature nice amenities like a fridge, large flat panel TV, window shades that work, and great bath products. The hotel property is definitely showing its age and despite the renovation, which has not yet extended to the public areas, doesn't feel as crisp or fresh as other Hyatt properties but if you're looking for a great location with many of the city's top locations within easy walking distance and great views (be sure to check out the bar on the 36th floor), this is the place to stay.",12-Oct-11,4
"I stayed here on business last week and was not disappointed. First of all, the location is wonderful - a short walk from a lot of attractions, close to the financial district, and just a nice central spot overall.The rooms have been completely renovated, and while a little too modern for my personal taste, they are very nice and well appointed. Pretty good sized too given the location, and mine was immaculate - I don't recall the last time I stayed in a room that felt so clean! Comfy bed, nice TV - a nice place to stay. My only complaint about the room was the shower. It had the worst water pressure and the nozzle was lousy in my opinion. Other than that, great rooms!Service was friendly and everyone was really accomodating. I have stayed in several hotels in the area and plan to make this my home base from now on because the location is really THAT great! I am really anxious to see the renovations of the 1980s lobby and the rest of the place.I almost forgot - the fitness center on the 36th floor is OUTSTANDING! Easily one of the nicest hotel gyms I have seen - it was huge, well equipped with really nice, new stuff, and the view was spectacular!",12-Oct-11,4
"Had an excellent three night stay here, the room was clean and quiet and all of my interactions with the staff were excellent. The floors are divided into four sectors or clusters of rooms so you don't get that oppressive long-hallway hotel feel, which is nice. My only complaint is that the room layout is a little weird but other than that it was recently redone with modern finishes and looked great. ",11-Oct-11,5
"Stayed july 2011. Excellent location if you want down town. wonderfully, relaxing rooms. Reception desk staff were distant and standoffish. Must see veiw from top floor restaurant/bar.Messed up my credit card by charging too many things on one day so bank stopped it, then they charged me twice! Writing this on 11 oct and still no refund. Not impressed with the customer service either. Lovely hotel spoilt by people who work there. I will update this when I get a refund.",11-Oct-11,3
"I liked everything about this hotel. It has recently been renovated so the rooms are clean and bright. There is lots of storage space, a small fridge, a safe big enough to hold both of our laptops, nice big windows. The bed was comfortable, the location is fantastic...just steps away from Union Square. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. The room was made up promptly each day. The only very, very minor annoyance was the noise through the adjoining door. If you can get a room without one of those it would be as close to perfect as a hotel can get!",11-Oct-11,5
"We are a family with 2 young children, so we decided to stay in the heart of this beaufitul city of San Francisco, as this was our firt trip to USA. We picked to stay at Grand Hyatt simply becasue it was affordable and after reading many of the reviews if was an easy decission. SO here is what we though about our stay at Grand Hyatt. Staff at the hotel was outstanding, very helpfull and always willing and able to answer all of out questions. Concierge staff we especially helpfull (one in partucular, from memory i think his name was Tom), he helped us organise our day tours and tickets to the Alkatraz. Rooms: We had a pleasure at staying in one of high flood rooms (2919) and we loved it. The view was just breath taking overlooking Union Square. Decor was modern and very sleek. Beds were very comfourtable which really help to have a good nights rest after a very long day of exploaring the city. Each morning we had our breakfast at the floor restaurant and the food was fantastic. Service was just as great. And the view amazing!!!! So thank you to everyone at Grand Hyatt for the start to our holiday to be one very unfogetfull and plasurable experience. If we come again to San Francisco we will definitelly be choosing Grand Hyatt as our accomodation. We loved every day we spent there!!!! Thank you!",10-Oct-11,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 3 nights in July this year. We had a newly renovated room and it was simply amazing! The view was superb. The hotel staff were very helpful and were always on top of all our requests. In terms of location it is very central. You literally step out the door and find yourself metres away from all the large department stores, boutiques and designer clothing. My husband and I loved every moment of it. The only downside was the parking as it was quite pricey being around the $40 mark for 24hours. Other than that, could not fault the hotel.",10-Oct-11,5
"I stayed here for business for two nights at the end of September. The location is great--right next to Union Square (I could see it from my window) and great shopping, yet close to the financial district, good restaurants and a short taxi ride from the Ferry Terminal. Fisherman's Wharf was a few minutes by taxi. The cable car was just a few blocks away.Check in was great-- ultra friendly and helpful. My room was on a high floor and had a fantastic view over Union Square and could see bits of the bay. They have these new electronic window shades which were really cool. The room was obviously recently refurbished--flat screen TV, funky orange and beige bathroom (the sink looked like a baby bathtub sitting on the orange glass counter). The decor was in beiges and oranges and was crisp and modern. There was even a clock radio (it may have been an iPod docking station also but I didn't have an iPod so did not really notice). The only thing that was a little disappointing was that there was a balcony but I could not open the door. I callled downstairs and they said someone could come up and open it for me. It seemed that this was the only way to access the balcony. Since I just wanted to snap a photo I declined. I think the balconies are from the 80s or something and the railings appear to be kind of low so it seemed like a safety issue. But really, the view from the nearly floor to ceiling window was spectacular enough without going out on the balcony so I did not mind. One evening my colleagues and I went upstairs to the bar on the 36th floor for drinks-- great view from up there!I did not eat in the hotel so could not comment on that.Taxis were readily available upon checkout. The doorman tried to get us to ""upgrade"" to a black town car and it seemed like he had some sort of ""arrangement"" with these cars but we just took a yellow taxi.I would highly recommend this hotel and the city of San Francisco!",9-Oct-11,4
"We stayed at this hotel for four nights and paid extra to use the ""Club"" facilities.The room we were allocated was on the 31st floor and was newly refurbished to a high standard.The hotel is well located for both shopping and access to the MUNI transport system. ( We paid $21 for a three day pass)The club area is located on the 26th floor and has full length windows overlooking the Bay and Alcatraz.Breakfast was freshly prepared and of the continental type. Tea, coffee and soft drinks were available all day and from 5pm until 9pm canapes followed by desserts are served.Alcoholic drinks are available from an honesty bar. Wine and beer cost $3 while spirits cost $4.After a long day sightseeing it was a welcome respite to relax and have a nibble and a drink while enjoying the views of The Bay.",6-Oct-11,4
Stayed here for 1 night for business. Location is right in the middle of Union Square so it is convenient to all. The hotel itself is very nice and staff is very friendly and helpful. The decor is updated with nice amenities. I had a fantastic view of the square and the noise level was very minimal. I do plan on returning to this location so that I may enjoy all that they have to offer.,5-Oct-11,5
"Right on Union Square, in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Easy to get to anywhere in the city from the Grand Hyatt - there is a BART station at Union Square, and the cable car line is across the street.The hotel itself is very nice. Rooms are recently renovated, nice workout facilities, and a bar on the top floor with nice views of downtown.The only potential downside I could see for people staying at this hotel is that since the hotel is in a high-traffic area, there is a lot of street noise that can be heard from your hotel room (we were on the 12th floor). On our vacation we also stayed a few nights in Fisherman's Wharf and it was much quieter there.",5-Oct-11,4
"The hotel has been newly renovated and the location is excellent if you want to indulge in some retail therapy.Check-in was efficient but not at all friendly. Check out however was both friendly and efficient.We booked a king club room directly with the hotel and were pleasantly surprised to find it was a large, attractive, sunny room with a floor to ceiling windows with a great view of the city and the bay in the distance. The bathroom fittings were very modern with a large sink and walk in shower. There is no bath which didnt bother us at all. A good quality, powerful hair dryer was also welcome. The only thing I didn't like about the bathroom was it had only a single hook on which to hang wet towels and no where to hang the hand towels.  We had a pair of men's trousers cleaned at the hotel and they didn't appear to have been cleaned at all. When I mentioned this at checkout, they immediately credited the cost back to our account. while we hadn't asked for this, it was much appreciated. Having stayed in Club rooms in other Hyatt hotels previously, I don't think this one warrants the additional cost given you need to pay for alcohol in the club room and while the soft drinks were gratis, there was a poor selection (and pepsi rather than coke) and the nibbles were limited and very uninspiring. Overall though an excellent hotel and will be my first choice next time I'm in San Francisco.",2-Oct-11,5
"The experience matches the expectation. You expect a great hotel, a great room and a receptive and friendly staff. You get all of this with a central downtown location. Modern decor and amenities in the refurbished room I had on the 14th floor including iPhone and USB ports on the bedside radio and lots of charging outlets. Will definitely be back!",2-Oct-11,5
"Usual high-end corporate luxury hotel, very comfortable. That said it suits holiday makers as well who do not feel out of place. Location is great, right on Union Square, so all the major shopping outlets in SF are no more than 2 blocks walk any direction (Macy's, Barney's designer stores). We had no need of a car when staying here for 3 days, it is one block from a stop on 2 SF cable car routes and on bus routes as well. 5 mins walk to Market Street where many department stores are situated, and a further bus routes to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 etc. To get to the waterfront at Pier 39 on public Transport takes 20 minutes including waiting and walking to bus / cable car stops! The down-town car hire return area for all firms, is an easy 3 blocks walk from the hotel.Don't breakfast in hotel, a Lori's diner is 1 block away and this is great value and fun, use it! Dinner should be in any one of a huge choice of restaurants within 2 blocks of this hotel, but use the hotel bar on the 36th floor before you go out. Fantastic views ove rthe whole city right down to the bay and Alcatraz (and the GG bridge if you crane your neck!), it has a good feeling to itStaff were friendly and helpful, probably more so than usual because we arrived on day 7 of a strike of housemaids which had a noisy demonstration outside the hotel for a few hours.Overal a great location for SF city, and a $16 shuttle ride to SFO airport.",29-Sep-11,5
"Stayed here for 3 nights in June 2011. The room was small, but it was updated very well and had great views of the city. We tried to print our boarding passes but were told we had to pay :( Overall the stay was pleasent and we had no problems",28-Sep-11,4
"I can't comment on pricing (was there on business) but the location was amazing. Right beside Union Square with walking distance to all kinds of shopping and amazing restaurants. There was a strike going on but the staff on site worked hard to ensure that guests weren't disrupted. The Concierge desk was very helpful and provided great advice on local eateries, etc. The on site gym is very good with everything you could need. The service in the lounge on the top floor did leave something to be desired so would not recommend spending any time/money there - especially given the fact that there are so many great bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.",26-Sep-11,4
We got a great deal on this hotel on Priceline and I was not disappointed. The room wasn't huge but was nice and we had a great view of the city and water (when it wasn't cloudy). We had a slight issue with our room when we got there but the hotel responded quickly and well and comped us breakfast in their top floor restaurant. Overall would definitely stay here again!,26-Sep-11,4
Love this hotel and I work for their competitor!! There was a strike going on and I cannot say enough about how accommodating the staff was.,25-Sep-11,5
"Great location although a little overpriced for this hotel. It has been recently renovated which was nice however the rooms are very small.Was not happy about the staff striking outside of the hotel from 6am to 10.30pm eachday! We could hear the noise which woke me up & delayed us getting to sleep at night, the best staff could offer were ear plugs which I thought was poor customer service!",24-Sep-11,4
"This hotel offered every thing we were looking for in our vacation. The location on Union Square was ideal, the newly renovated rooms were spacious, and our view on the 27th floor was perfect. I loved the remote control shade in the room...Superb idea!",23-Sep-11,5
"I stayed in the recently renovated hotel. Most of the renovations are great. In addition to comfortable beds and directed bed reading lights, the window shade can be operated from the bed. There were a few negatives, especially in the bath. The sink takes up a lot of the counter and there are no drawers, so the vanity can get cluttered with toiletry items. The rain shower head can not be tilted, so you end up standing very close to the wall to get the full stream of water.Perhaps the biggest issue was the lack of drawer space in the room. What looks like a chest of drawers contains a small refrigerator and a safe. There are 3 very small drawers in the closet, which takes up room that could hold suitcases. So the suitcases end up in the room.",23-Sep-11,4
"Chose the Grand Hyatt for extra miles on my airlines Visa card and a Welcome credit, check their website for details, but it was so much more than just saving a buck! Newly renovated, the room impressed me. On top of that, every employee was pleasant, helpful, and not so stuck in the ""be professional"" mode that impresses some. When a tour company left me high and dry in the woods (literally), I desperately called the front desk, who immediately made calls and checked the internet, finally making arrangements with other tour groups so that I could board their bus and make it back to the hotel. I won't stay anywhere else!",22-Sep-11,5
"Unable to secure reservations at the nearby Hyatt Regency Embarcadero because of a convention, my husband and I opted to give the Grand Hyatt a try. Having booked 2 award nights, we were only entitled to a standard 2-double bedded room on a low floor. Upon arrival however, our Platinum level membership in the Hyatt Gold Passport program was acknowledged and we were upgraded to a king-bedded room-with-a-view on the 30th floor. Any lingering disappointment we may felt with settling for our second choice hotel disappeared. The recently-renovated room served as a plush eyrie for the finale of our California vacation. We enjoyed our stay, although the high tech room fittings may need some adjustments; you can control lights and the electric window shade from both bedsides; during the wee hours of our second night, we were awakened twice by the lights coming on and shade going up inexplicably. We could find no way that either one of us had tripped the buttons, but since we were departing at an ungodly hour for an early flight, we never pursued it further beyond a post-stay email to management to note the glitch.",20-Sep-11,4
"Strange hotel with no lobby so to speak - friends meeting me at the hotel had to stand up near the doorway. Fabulous location in the heart of Union Square shopping district. The room is very nice and the view is spectacular. I did not have breakfast nor use room service. The hotel is totally overpriced, very impersonal as is the staff.",20-Sep-11,4
"We took BART from the airport to Powell Street and then walked the 4 blocks to the hotel- very convenient. Rooms are very well-appointed and have been recently redone. Appreciated having a coffee maker and refrigerator in the room and having the reading lights by the side of the bed and the darkening shade for the window that was controlled from the bedside. We had a nice view of Union Square from our 24th floor room and could have also seen the water if the fog had not been so thick!!! We booked a AAA rate that included breakfast which ended up to be a $50 credit each day for breakfast. That more than covered the cost of the buffet plus part of the tip. I think the buffet was about $23 pp, but was very good and included eggs, meats, cereals, fruits, oatmeal, yogurt, granola and breads with french toast, pancakes and waffles made to order. They had a scrambled egg with chorizo that was wonderful. There was also a separate breakfast menu to order from. I tried the Orange Brioche French Toast one morning that I can still taste. Also, complimentary papers each morning by the elevators. Everything about the hotel, including the location, is perfect.",19-Sep-11,5
"Was here for a conference in late August. Nicely located just off Union Square. Given a room on the 32nd floor which offered nice views, although the views are much better on the side facing east. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Wi-fi about $10/day.",19-Sep-11,4
"We have been fans of the Hyatt for a long time - and despite checking in on the very first day of the week-long noisy and disruptive picket line by hotel staff who were members of the Local 2 union at the Grand Hyatt Union Square, our stay was very pleasant, and service continued seamlessly to the same high standards expected of a Hyatt. There may have been minor hiccups, but these were understandable as the Hotel had to deploy temp workers, with Hyatt staff coming in to support from other locations. On the flip side, we benefited from the excellent assistance extended by the many managers and executives who were on the hotel floor and at the entrance!Once the regular staff were back to work, we also certainly could not fault their service either!The renovated rooms are wonderful. We had a corner room, with the bathroom located on the inner side (rather than right by the entrance passageway), and a vanity table as well. There were many thoughtful touches - from the bedside electronic controls for the black-out screen, as well as the flexi-reading lamp that could be adjusted to just what you need and the many AC points throughout the room. A special word about the concierges who assisted us - Joanna, you are a gem and you even helped our new-found friends solve their last minute car rental! Anne and Elaine - equally knowlegeable, quick on the take and with generous doling out of practical and honest advise! A big THANK YOU!!Now that all the rooms have been renovated, we were told that the lobby and restaurant will also be renovated / remodelled in the next year or so. We certainly look forward to returning soon!",18-Sep-11,4
"We stayed here for 4 nights in August/Sept while my husband attended a conference. We went for the ""Regency Club"" rooms, so that I would have a place to go for breakfast in the mornings, and they had a cocktail setup there in the evenings. I recommend paying a little more for this - a nice lounge, great breakfast buffet, and appetizers/desserts in the evening.Our first night at the hotel, we had the misfortune of having a crying baby in the next room on the other side of a connecting door! Admittedly, not the hotel's fault, but at my request, they did move us to another room on the same floor the next day. It had a connecting door, too, but that was to a suite that was not in use, so it was blissfully quiet and looked down on Union Square and out at Mount Sutro with a sliver of a Bay view. My biggest complaint about this hotel is their elevators. Usually, buildings that are as many floors have two banks of elevators - one for the lower floors and one for the upper floors. The Hyatt has 8 or 10 elevators, and they all go to the 30-something floors.Also, don't bring a car and valet park. It was something we had to do with plans ahead of and behind our stay here, but we paid for it. The first night, we did valet, and after that, it was put at the self-park option.The staff at the hotel was unfailingly wonderful, from the front desk people, to the servers upstairs, the concierge, and the room attendants --- all top notch and all noticeably happy to be working there. Kudos to John, the concierge and the front desk person from Peru (was his name Roberto -no, but it was something like that-sorry for forgetting) for giving that little extra bit of service that made us feel special! The young man from Peru even took me back into my old room to search for a missing item, which I later found tucked into something I had packed. What an asset he is to Hyatt!",17-Sep-11,4
"I have stayed here on business several times and it is perfectly adequate. I find breakfast to be rediculously expensive...The rooms are fine. Location is excellent, and it is very close to the Ferry Building which has some nice places to eat and a great wine bar.",15-Sep-11,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt on a recent business trip. My expectations were high going into my stay and the Grand Hyatt met my expectations. I was greeted promptly at check-in and welcomed by the desk staff; very personable and friendly. My room was on the 27th floor overlooking Union Square...great view through the floor to ceiling windows! Amenities were good, room was clean, bed was comfortable. My only small complaint was the bathtub and shower head. Hotels in a similar class often have deep soaking tubs which are nice after the walking you are likely to do in San Francisco. Shower left a bit to be desired, not sure if it was the shower head or the water pressure.Top floor restaurant and bar was nice; average food, strong drinks, great views in every direction.Overall I would stay at the Grand Hyatt again and would recommend for others, particularly business travelers or couples.",14-Sep-11,4
"We had a corner room on a low floor. It only had a view of the street but the room and the bathroom had recently been renovated. It was very nicely done. The staff was also very helpful in helping us print boarding passes, hail cabs, etc. We really enjoyed our stay.",14-Sep-11,5
"Really enjoyed our stay here,judging by some of the previous comments was a bit worried about what we were about to find.It's a modern high rise and we were on the 26th floor.the room looked brand new with the furnishings and wide screen tv. Staff were helpful and the hotel is ideally situated just off Union Sq. We walked down to Fishermans Wharf and caught the cable car back which dropped us just around the corner of the hotel.would definatly stay here again and would recommend to anyone.Ps large modern gym on the 32nd floor with amazing views across the bay onto Alcatraz.",12-Sep-11,5
"My husband and I stayed here after fretting for weeks over which hotel to choose in San Francisco. I knew it was a chain and wouldn't have ""local flavor"", but also knew it would have good size rooms and we'd avoid the ""boutique but tiny"" conditions at some others. I am happy with my decision. The rooms are newly remodeled and very comfortable. Having an in-room fridge is also a nice benefit not found in many others. We got a great deal here through AAA that included the buffet breakfast daily, which normally would have been @$25/person. The buffet was nice and you could also order pancakes, belgian waffles, or eggs to order if desired. Filling up on this meal allowed us to go without lunch and saved us a bundle! Great location, as much of San Francisco is within walking distance. Concierge staff was most helpful and pleasant. You can't go wrong staying here.",12-Sep-11,4
"I stayed here for two nights during Labor Day weekend with my boyfriend. The front desk staff happily accommodated our request for a room near our friends. We stayed on the 26th floor, which had great views. The rooms facing the Bay are probably the best, but the view of Union Square is also very cool. Loved the bathroom sinks, reading lights, ipod charger plugs and the electric window shade that you can easily open and close while laying on the bed. Also really liked the modern decor and remodeled bathroom, with separate vanity area. The only con is how long it took to get an elevator Saturday morning around 10am. It took about 15 minutes, maybe longer. If you run into the same problem, just get on one that's going up and ride it back down to the lobby. That finally worked for us.",12-Sep-11,4
"Location Location Location! Nice rooms, very clean. Excellent view, loved the balcony. A balcony is a treat in San Fran. Out the door and you are in a great spot. Ferry building right there. Liked that we were left alone. You only saw staff if you needed something and then they were right there. Would stay again if my budget allowed, it is a little expensive.",12-Sep-11,4
"We stayed at this hotel for four days the first week of August. The hotel was renovated and is very nice. The rooms are clean and very nice, with all of the amenities you need, and while not huge, they are certainly not small. We found a great deal on Costco for the Hyatt Hotels, and so you received a discount rate, plus if you stayed 2 nights, the 3rd night was free, and upon check-in, we had a room on the 25th Floor overlooking Union Square. The location is really nice, being right at Union Square and a half a block from the cable car stop, plus about 2 blocks to Chinatown. All of the hotel personnel were very nice, always offering to help in any way possible, from the front desk to the doormen, and the people at the concierge desk were terrific in helping us to find restaurants and the best way to get to places on our list of places to go (and suggesting some additional ones). Wi-fi is available, but there is a charge (and should be included in a hotel of this class), but if you really want to avoid that, Starbucks is directly across from the front door of the hotel. If you have time, there is a great fitness which occupies an entire floor of the hotel.",12-Sep-11,4
"Great hotel, gentle staff and very nice view. Complimentary coffee and amenities. The view of the top-floor bar and restaurant is amazing. Downside: the wi-fi is not free.",12-Sep-11,4
The rooms have been redone since the last time we stayed here. They are very modern and well appointed. The hotel is quiet and comfortable despite being busy. The staff was very courteous.,12-Sep-11,5
"Faultless stay at the Hyatt! We had a lovely room that had recently been refurbished so was very modern and clean, with the best bed ever!Great location too, good for shopping and restaurants, although because of our long day we ate in the Hotel restaurant on the top floor and were not disappointed. The service from Frank and team was fantastic, and the piano player in the bar afterwards was brilliant.Will definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone!",11-Sep-11,5
"Enjoyed my stay here, very good hotel in good location. Would definitely recommend it to everyone. ",11-Sep-11,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for six nights in June this year, and had a fab time. Our room was on the 25th floor, giving us great views across the city. The room was spacious and had everything we needed. The Portico toiletries were replenished daily - I couldn't get enough of them! Bed was huge and there was a good selection of tv channels (if you can find time to watch tv!). My other half enjoyed playing with the electric blind on the huge floor-to-ceiling window.The hotel charges for wifi, so if we wanted to check emails, etc we just went to the Starbucks across the street and used their free wifi while enjoying a coffee. The hotel is in a great location. It's within very easy walking distance of the main shopping area and Chinatown. We also walked to City Hall and Fisherman's Wharf (though this wouldn't have been as pleasant in cold or wet weather. Public transport is easily accessible from the hotel too and I don't think it's too far from the business district.We ate in the hotel's restaurant on our last night, and had a beautiful meal which wasn't overly expensive. The views from up there are amazing.Overall, I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again on my next visit to San Fran. ",11-Sep-11,5
"We stay at the hyatt for 4 nights from the 22nd to the 25th Aug, we are a family of 4 and our standard room was a good size for a city hotel, on checking in we asked for a room with a view and 'Ryan' was so helpful. We had a room on the 27th Floor with great views over the city and the bar on the top floor is a must for a late night drink the views are outstanding. All the staff that we dealt with were very helpful, the hotel is clean, the rooms are quite and the beds just so comfortable. The location is fantastic for restaurants, shopping, tram-line, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel we can't wait to go back!",10-Sep-11,4
"We stayed at the Grand hyatt from 22nd -27th August, it was fabulous right from the start! Check in was quick and easy, we had a fabulous room on the 23rd floor, overlooking the city. Our room was recently refurbished, the room was very spacious with lovely matching bedding and curtains. We had an electronic blind which was super. Everywhere was lovely and clean. The bathroom was maybe a little small but that didnt really bother us. Plenty of hanging space for our clothes. The hotel itself was very clean, the lobby was very pleasant. All of the staff were very polite and helpful especially Elaine the conciege, who was very helpful to us. The location of the hotel was perfect, just a block away from Macys, saks, tiffanys and lots of great resturants nearby. China town was very close, we had an easy walk through Chinatown and on to Northbeach from there we found Lombard street, which we walked up and got some wonderful views of the city. I would definetly recommend the sightseeing hop on hop off bus, this was a great way of seeing the city highlights.Recommended restuarants: Lories diner, Maxs, Bubba Gumps and the Hard rock cafe. With such a fabulous city to explore it was great to know we had a lovely comfy bed to fall into at the end of a very busy and fun day. We would definetly stay at this hotel again it was brilliant!",9-Sep-11,5
We have stayed in hotels all over the world and I must say the Hyatts are always number one hands down! This one location was in the middle of everything! Don't rent a car because not needed and parking is outrageous. Service was very impressive. Concierge really knowledgeable and seemed caring. The city itself was awesome and we will definitely go back again.,7-Sep-11,5
"had 5 nts in this lovely hotel. excellent service, large very comfortable room, spotlessly clean. our room on the 8th floor had quite good views but not exceptional. The food and service on the 36th floor dining room was very good, and not much more expensive than some of the cheapish diners in the area. the hotel is only a block from Powell street, union square, and about 5 flat (ie no hills) blocks from chinatown leading into little italy.tip. buy the 7 day pass if you plan to use the cable cars-which charge $3.95 per journey. the Pass allows unlimited cable car rides and most of the trolley buses for the week.tip.if you want breakfast away from the hotel, go to Mamas, on the corner of Washington Square. It is quite a walk from the Hyatt, but the food is superb, prices are very reasonable. But-it is small and gets crowded. we had to wait for an hour to get in, and this was 10 in the morning.tip. lots of ways to get from SFO to city centre. we recommend just taking a standard taxi, which although will cost a bit more, is worth it as it will take you direct to your hotel in half the time of one of the other transfer methods.we would certainly go back to this hotel.",6-Sep-11,5
"This is a great, clean hotel in a prime location for shopping and other attractions. My friend and I received a renovated room with ample room. The bathroom was well lit, the beds were comfortable and the room was outfitted with the latest electronic gadgets. Hotel staff and concierge were all very friendly. The hotel has a lounge on the top floor with great views. It's a must see.",5-Sep-11,5
We stayed here for 4 nights in a 10th floor room:Positives:1) Location - fantastic!! close to all the shops of union square and walkable to all attractions including Pier 33 for Alcatraz (approx 40 mins)2) Clean room which had everything you needed3) Helpful concierge - provided useful maps and books (which had discount vouchers for local stores)Negatives:1) Check in took a long time as the woman serving us was rather confused about what she was doing and took a while to get the roomOverall a very positive experience and a fantastic location for walking through a wonderful city.,5-Sep-11,4
"I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and the service was up to Hyatt standards. As a Diamond member I was treated very well, however, they were very busy and not able to check us in for quite some time. The only downfall was the $42 valet parking. I will admit the valets were quick with getting you your car, but it is still not worth the money.",1-Sep-11,3
"We took the subway from the airport to the powell st station(9 bucks) and walked the 4 blocks to the hotel. We stayed in room 3105 a grand club room with access to the grand club on the 32nd floor. The view from our room on the 31st floor faced directly at the fishermans wharf, alcatraz island and bay which was awesome. The same view you get from the restaurant on the 36th floor. Check in was quick and efficient. Any of the 6 elevators are fast ! The room looked just as beautiful as the hyatt website which included a mini fridge, safe, full closet, very comfortable bed and electric shade controlled by a button by the bed and door. If you get a grand club room, you will have access to the grand club concierge room on the 32nd floor which opens at 6am to 9pm. It provides free hot breakfast with fresh fruit as well as beverages, in fact you can get coffee tea soda and juices all day. From 5-7pm there is hot hor duerves , vegetables, cheeses, bread and about 10 name brand liquors including beer and wine. Aside from the food, its a nice room to relax and enjoy the view of the bay. The staff out front will hail cabs for you. There is a starbucks across the st and another starbucks one block away on powell st across from the 24 hr walgreens that sells sandwhiches and grocery store type food. The cable car is one block away(powell/hyde line) and will take you to ghiradelli square/fishermans wharf district. We met numerous other people on the various tours we took and not too many liked thier hotel but, they all knew the grand hyatt was wonderful. Oh yeah, the water pressure was fine on the 31st floor. Personally, I think the lobby looks good no need to remodel it next year. The exercise room on the 35th floor was awesome with 4 treadmills 3-4 bikes and all new equipment for every muscle group, 30 to 40 dumbell free weights and TV screens everywhere and head sets and towels provided along with a small fridge next to the elevator of rolled chilled towelettes to wipe off the face and body after working out. We enjoyed the friendly concierge downstairs as well as the ones on the 32nd floor grand club. Thanks for a great vacation !",31-Aug-11,5
"This was our first time to San Francisco and I went with my wife and 4 kids. The hotel was very centrally located to various shopping districts and restaurants, all within walking distance. The cable cars were simply 2 blocks away so we were never far away from too much. Check in and check out were easy and efficient and room was really perfect with 2 adjoining rooms. The only item that was missing was a pool - not sure why they didnt include one. Other than that, gym and restaurant on top floor were great too. Highly recommended ......",31-Aug-11,5
"My husband and I stayed at the newly refurbished Grand Hyatt for one night on our way to the car races at Monterey. Our next door neighbors were so noisy and disruptive that the hotel management not only put us in the Club section of the hotel, but staff moved all our luggage quickly and efficiently. The location is wonderful for enjoying this special city.",30-Aug-11,5
The location was very good because Union Square is at walking distance. People were very polite and the service was good and effective. The rooms all have a plasma TV (which is important for some people). The view was my favorite part because you had a view of the buildings of San Francisco and The Transamerican Building,30-Aug-11,5
"At the last minute, I booked a room at the Grand Hyatt. They've recently renovated with a clean, european lines but with a touch of Asian inspired colors and deco. Clean, comfy and fantastic service. Plus, I got a marvelous view of Union Square from my room. Great amenities like convenient bedside plugs; wireless internet (for a fee) and a push button electric shade for the windows.",29-Aug-11,4
"This is an awesome hotel. The location is perfect. Easy access to subway, bus, taxi, any other way you like to get around! Located in Union Square, there are many shops and restaurants within walking distance. The concierge desk was very helpful with planning tours and recommending restaurants/bars. The rooms are very clean and spacious. The beds are SOOO comfortable! The room made us feel like we could just relax. They had automatic window shades that you can activate from the bed! All employees we encountered were very nice, polite and helpful. Definitely a ""Grand"" Hyatt! Some negatives - the hotel is pricey (but I guess you get what you pay for). Breakfast is not included. They charge for w-fi / internet service. Overall, I would definitely stay here again.",29-Aug-11,5
"Just returned from a weeks stay in this hotel, we booked a bay view room, the view was stunning, over the city to Alcatraz. The bed was ultra comfortable, best one we've ever had in a hotel. Location and staff were fantastic. Only thig we can grumble about is the ten dollar per day charge for wifi which when we all rely on it these days seems very expensive",28-Aug-11,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt August 17-21, 2011 as a family traveling with another family.. We couldn't be happier! The location at Union Square was perfect and was within walking distance of Chinatown and the Powell Street cable car. While each family had issues with our rooms, the managers not only gave credit to our accounts but also moved us to better rooms, and we were very happy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again!",25-Aug-11,4
"My son and i stayed here last week on the second half of our vacation to the west coast..It has been recently remodeled in a modern decor.Rooms are a tad small- but typical for a big city- Better than New York anyway! Beds were excellent and Comfortable. THere was a refrigerator and flat screen TV. The sink in the Bathroom was unique and looked like a mini porcelain tub! You got Floor to ceiling windows with Push Button Shades- we were on a higher floor so had great views! The views from those windows are A very nice feature. There is a great bar on the 36th floor and some evenings they have a piano player to entertain you. . The staff here was Great- The concierge staff particularly are knowledgeable, efficient, Friendly and helpful- Particularly Joanna and Ann- they were great! The location of this hotel is very convenient as it is only a block or 2 from the big department stores and only one block up to Powell St to the Cable car stop and Sears Restaurant . You can walk into Chinatown from here too! The Union Square area is the more traditional historic area to stay in when in SanFrancisco as opposed to the other main tourist area which is Fisherman's Wharf. I prefer this area of town over the wharf which is very touristy and crowded.Stay here and visit the wharf on one of the Two Cable Car lines.When you get back in the evening walk over a couple of blocks to Lefty Odouls bar and restaurant for a lively piano bar and Karoake!",24-Aug-11,5
"This hotel is pricey. Just like most luxury hotels they charge for everything other than your room- wi-fi, parking, in room movies, whatever. If you accept that going into your stay, chances are you will love this hotel! (if not, just look elsewhere, you will not be happy here.) I had a room on the 31st floor with a spectacular view...loved it. If you don't get a room with a water view, take yourself up to the 36th floor and splurge on a cocktail, breakfast, lunch, or even coffee and dessert. Worth whatever it costs - I particularly like breakfast, as you can watch the fog roll in/out over Alcatraz. Service throughout the hotel is courteous and professional...but be aware, this is not a small boutique hotel where everybody knows your name. It is huge hotel, and it may feel a little impersonal, but I thought I paid for excellent service and received it. For me, the location is all - easy to get everywhere, lots of fab shopping, great dining within a few blocks, EZ walk to Chinatown...I just don't think it can be beat. And when it is all said and done, that's what I am paying for - LOCATION. A helpful hint...price a room with access to the Club Lounge. It will cost, but includes breakfast, snacks, hor d'eourves, dessert and coffee, etc. There's even a cappuccino machine! When you add it all up, you may find the extra cost is more than worth it. An added benefit - the club is on the corner of the 32nd floor with 2 full walls of windows...spectacular view!",24-Aug-11,5
"We stayed here for the Bay to Breakers race. Had a blast! Upgraded to a 1 br. suite (with second bathroom!). It had a lovely long balcony from which we could gaze at the clock tower and Bay Bridge. The standout memory though, was the customer service. In a property that big, it is nice when workers remember your name and greet you as you pull in to valet parking, or are just passing through the lobby. Nice touch! Also, the lobby bar had an excellent menu, and good mixologists, so we ended up spending more time there than we originally planned.",24-Aug-11,5
"My family and I stayed here as a first stop in our California vacation. The hotel is beautiful, clean and modern. We had two connecting rooms, and with the doors opened felt like a nice family suite. There is a restaurant on the top floor with panoramic views of the city and Alcatraz Island. We had a very nice lunch on the day we arrived, and the prices were reasonable. The breakfast buffet is $22.50, but if you don't feel like splurging there is a Starbucks across the street, a bagel store down the block and Lori's Diner a few blocks away. The gym is clean but small so get there early if you want to secure a treadmill or elliptical. There are a few free weights and weight machines as well.The hotel is in a perfect location. It is within walking distance to a major shopping area, and the trolley. The staff at the front desk was so helpful. They printed walking directions for us to a Chinese restaurant, Fang, which wasn't so great. Also, Santorini, which is within walking distance wasn't good at all either.For a fun tour of the city check out Mr.Toad's Tours. A boat ride to Alcatraz can also be combined with the tour. Don't miss Ghiradelli Square or Fisherman's Wharf. While at the Square have lunch at McCormick & Kulleto's. The restaurant is in a great location and although a bit pricey, very good. At Fisherman's Wharf you can dine at In n' Out Burger, Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gump Shrimp and many other options. Also, make sure you make the drive to Muir Woods. Absolutely breathtaking. On the way back stop at Sausalito for some ice cream and a stoll at the marina.",23-Aug-11,4
"My boyfriend and I just stayed here for 6 nights in the beginning of August 2011. We had a corner room on the 33 floor the view was beautiful and the room was fabulous. We were in a recently renovated room with a king bed. We have absolutely no complaints about the hotel, and heard very little noise at night. The concierge was very helpful and pointed us in the right direction for anything we needed help with. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",22-Aug-11,5
"The hotel is situated on the corner of Union Square and a minute from Chinatown. It is in the heart of everything. Close to restaraunts, shops, and the transportation (trolley and the cable cars). The rooms are small but very clean. And the views are amazing. Note: currently the end of the lobby beyond the elevators is undergoing construction...so if you are traveling with kids there's NO lobby restroom to use so you have to go back to your room. That was the only thing that annoyed me. And of course they say ""oh there's one on the 36 floor"" while your kid is ready to pee everywhere. Anyway, service was quick and efficient. They were helpful staff. Of course valet is overpriced but its the same everywhere. $50. You are walking distance to market street where you can pick up a cable car. And Powell is right around the corner where you can pick up the trolley. Shower pressure is low so don't expect the water to be shooting out at you. They provide a blow dryer which is awesome and a refigerator at no extra cost which is totally great for bringing snacks and drinks.I would definetely stay here again when in San Francisco. I would not stay near the Wharf even though it was fun to walk around there best to stay where all the action is in Union Square.",22-Aug-11,4
"I decided to book the Grand Hyatt after an excellent stay at the Grand Hyatt in NYC. We loved our stay and were really looking forward to the same kind of experience in San Francisco. First impressions were good, the hotel is in a brilliant location and the staff were wonderful. The room was as expected for a 4* hotel; really comfy beds, flat screen TV and a great view. However, after getting unpacked a few things became clear... Firstly, the owner of this particular hotel is clearly intent on squeezing every last cent out of his guests. During our trip we had stayed in much cheaper hotels and motels, and had saved the best for last, or so we thought. We had enjoyed free Internet access and a huge variety of TV channels on our road trip, so imagine our disappointment when we learned that we would be charged $10 per day for Wifi. This was a joke, and how any right-minded person can think it's acceptable to charge for something that is nowadays a basic necessity is quite beyond me. We had to go across the road to Starbucks to use their free Wifi, and it's fair to say that their coffee was a lot cheaper than our hotel room. My girls and I like to stay in our room at night and watch TV, but once again we were hugely disappointed to discover that there were only a very small number of free TV channels available. This is penny-pinching at its very worst, and is definitely not what I would expect from such an esteemed chain of hotels. The safe in the room was not functioning, and the famed American power shower was a feeble dribble. The room had been recently renovated and I have no idea why a room on the 18th floor cannot get decent water pressure, especially when every fitting is brand new. They did send up an engineer to look at the shower, but even after he'd tinkered the shower was still feeble. I made my disappointment known to the hotel management and the lady in charge of guest services was a delight. She was most apologetic but it was clear that the owner of this particular Hyatt does not think it necessary to offer guests the same standard of amenities that other hotels in the chain enjoy.In conclusion, I would like to commend the hotel's staff as they were faultless, but would also like to voice my sadness that what should have been a memorable stay in a luxury hotel was spoiled by the miserly attitude of the owners.This stay has put me off staying at a Hyatt hotel in future, which is really sad.",22-Aug-11,3
"Beds were great..... so comfortable.Under construction? - I knew this beforehand and was a bit worried, we never even saw a glimpse of evidence! Fantastic location - able to walk everywhere: Coit Tower, Fishermans' Wharf, Ghiradelli, China Town, Union Square, and Starbucks right across the street. THAT was awesome!Our service was excellent - the bell hop, the staff, the roomservice, and consierge - all were so helpful and kind.And the main thing? It was completely CLEAN and COMFY!",21-Aug-11,5
"On Union Square, amazing location, good service, great room, wonderful view from the restaurant. I don't have anything else to say but RECOMMENDED! Much better than Westin St Francis. ;)",20-Aug-11,5
"The restaurant views from the 36th floor were aweome. The food and menu was also very good. The room was very comfortable except the shower was alittle week. The sheets were great the beds were very comfortable. The room decor was very contempory.The location was great. We were able to walk to China town within a few blocks, we walked to the Embarcadero and climbed Coit tower on the way. We did lots of San Francisco on foot and it was great.Grammy Sharon",19-Aug-11,4
Really nice place to stay. The service couldn't have been better. Very close to Union Square.,19-Aug-11,5
"It's difficult to be objective about a hotel that takes your booking, takes your money and then decides to give your room to someone else because you don't check in until later than they might expect.The stay at the Grand Hyatt was part of a pacy business trip covering a lot of the west coast of the US, and we had only a single night's stay booked there. We expected to be arriving there late in the day from LA, staying overnight and then moving on to Seattle on the following night. Given the activity during this trip a good night's sleep was essential so we didn't scrimp on hotel costs.We arrived at the Hyatt shortly before 11pm and were told that the hotel had no rooms left. We pointed out that we had booked - and had confirmations for - three rooms. The staff apologised for ""a mix up"" when it was very clear that they had decided we were going to be no-shows and thus sold our rooms on again. As you can imagine this was far from ideal given the time of night and the need for us to be away again the following day.After a fair amount of heated discussion we were found three rooms, all much less than we'd paid for, and all with sofa beds rather than actual beds. We were in no real position to turn these down and while the Hyatt promised to refund our credit cards with the difference in price, the fact is that this is a pretty shoddy business practise all round.Apologies were made, but it really is not good enough and not what one would expect from a hotel with the reputation of the Hyatt.",19-Aug-11,1
"Just returned from the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, Aug. 13. First impression...not great as the lobby is small and underwhelming. Not much room to sit if waiting to meet ppl. Loved the fact that Hyatt guarantees connecting rooms with their ""family plan"" and a discount on the 2nd room to boot!! Rooms were small, but nicely done. Beds oh-so-comfortable! Actually that was the best thing about the hotel. Had brunch upstairs 4 out of the 7 days there with my family. Ok...nothing great. Wait staff very friendly along with the concierges and doormen. Starbucks everywhere as the location was great for shopping and coffee! We did not rent a car instead choose to walk, cab it or take some form of public transportation. Overall a very good hotel.",17-Aug-11,4
"Stayed here for a family trip out to San Fran. Location is great, the service team was wonderful and took care of all our needs quickly and effectively. The room we received (upgraded due to diamond status) was great. Newly renovated, clean, well decorated, great electronic and room features and fantastic bed. The breakfast upstairs was delicious and the lounge was nice as well (was a bit small due to the usual lounge under construction currently). Would recommend and would go again. Was only about 4 blocks or so from subway station and was an easy walk even with luggage. Area was safe as well. We got the stay at our corporate rate so was very afforable.",16-Aug-11,5
"Stayed here for three nights. Very modern room that had been renovated. As the room was on the third floor there was alot of street noise and no view. The view from the restaurant was amazing. We found the staff to be more than willing to go out of the way to help you. Great hotel We will be back, just next time asking for a high floor.",14-Aug-11,4
We stayed here for 3 nights and although the room was small it was clean and comfortable and the location was superb. The staff were very welcoming and the concierges were really helpful and their recommendations were fabulous. The breakfast was buffet style hot or cold with a view of the city which was breath taking. Can highly recommend the hop on/off bus suggested by the hotel and take a cable car ride from Union Square down to Fishermans Wharf. The hotel is next door to the Levis flagship store on Union Square so you can't get closer than that and the Westfield shopping centre is a couple of mins walk.,14-Aug-11,5
"We stayed at the Hyatt while we were attending a conference in San Francisco. We liked the location in Union Square, near to where we wanted to be. The rooms were also very nice and the staff was good.",13-Aug-11,5
"The dark, cramped lobby of this hotel makes an underwhelming impression, as does the the lackluster service. It took several minutes for someone at the front desk to provide me with a replacement key, and she didn't acknowledge my obvious impatience. And the next morning at a breakfast with colleagues, my food came about five minutes after everyone else's, with no explanation or acknowledgment. The breakfast itself? Average.So if you're on a business trip, on a tight schedule and used to polished service, this isn't going to be your top choice. Not surprisingly, most of the guests looked like families on vacation, and price was probably a bigger consideration for them.The rooms are quiet and nicely redone--although my mattress had a pronounced sag on one side. There's free wi-fi. And the view from the restaurant on the 36th floor is great.",12-Aug-11,3
"We stayed here for two nights. Everyone from the front desk to the balers to the concierge were incredibly helpful. The highlight of our stay was the breakfast buffet both mornings. The selection of food items was magnificent and the taste exceptional! However, it was the service we received from our waiter Danny that made the time special. He waited on us the first morning and was especially attentive. Danny asked us how long we were staying so he knew when we arrived the next morning that we were anxious to get to Yosemite. He made sure that our food arrived quickly as well as providing to go cups for our coffee! Since we were traveling with our three boys, I booked connecting rooms for a FANTASTIC price. It was heaven having the extra space. If only there was free wi fi as well.",11-Aug-11,5
"Cannot beat the location, just off Union Square! The front desk upon check-in was efficient but not too friendly or welcoming (late evening staff). The front desk upon departure was very friendly (daytime). So, I guess it depends upon the individual. The rooms are modern and comfortable. The beds are very comfortable and we slept very well while staying here for 4 nights. The rooms are clean and well maintained which you would expect for a Hyatt. The only thing we did not like was the fairly sizable gap under the room door. We could hear everything in the hallway due to this. So, we put a blanket across the bottom of the door and it was ok then.We had a reasonable corporate rate so it made this very good value for us. Overall this hotel was great. I would definitely stay here again.",11-Aug-11,4
"the location of the best ,right in the center of Union Square which is perfect to who likes to shopping. lots of shops around. view of the restaurants also excellent.staffs was friendly ,tried to help",10-Aug-11,3
"After pouring over Tripadvisor reviews, I was torn between several hotels. I eventually chose the Grand Hyatt (due to conversing with concierge Susan) and I feel we definitely made an excellent choice. Our room was on the 29th floor overlooking the bay and Alcatraz. The views were incredible and the three days we stayed were clearer than normal, so we really had beautiful scenery. The beds were comfortable, and we liked the renovations made to the room/bathroom with the oversided sink. Location to everywhere we wanted to go: trolley cars, shopping, Starbucks, Chinatown, etc. was very convenient! The conceirge Joanne was exceptional and got us everywhere we needed to go easily! We would definitely recommend this hotel.",10-Aug-11,5
"Location and view was great, however the room had uncomfortable chairs to sit on. Self parking was a pain as the communication between the garage and hotel forced me to go back and forth across the street a few times. There is nothing fancy about the rooms, small, average design, But great location. We walked all over the city and this is a great central location to be at.",10-Aug-11,3
"Just completed the room renovation so room is brand new. But lobby was so old, and no security. Anybody can jump in to the elevator. Standard room only comes with one chair by the work table, no other place to sit other than the beds. If the rates are good I would stay here again but if the rates are higher I would rather be Intercontinental SF or St.Regis.",8-Aug-11,3
"I chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. I also chose it because it had a shuttle bus running from the hotel to the trade show I was going to at Moscone Center. The hotel is contemporary and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful. What I like about the hotel was its location. It was walking distance to a lot of shopping centers, restaurants and around Union Square. It was close to Chinatown. I only had three minor problems while at this hotel. The first was that they put us at a handicap room. When I questioned them about it they stated that the room had good views. But it was just odd that they did this considering I did not request for a handicap room. I know for a fact that there were other rooms available that also had good views. Needless to say I still accepted it as the room was comfortable and clean. My second issue was the air conditioner unit. When I arrived it was not working. An engineer came to fix it but when he left it did not work again. The second time he came it finally worked. However, the unit made some noises which kept my partner up one night. Third, was the elevator. There was a total of six elevators yet the wait time was horrendous. There was one time I was at the lobby waiting for a good five minutes.But overall the hotel was great. What I like most about the hotel was the location, the views, the clean/contemporary look/feel, the comfortable bed, the exercise room, the toiletries (shampoo/soap has a great scent), room service, and the breakfast buffet.The parking was $36 self-park and $55 valet - per day. Knowing that it was San Francisco, I actually expected the high price set for parking. Make sure you bring walking shoes as you will surely walk around this beautiful city.",8-Aug-11,4
"This hotel is our destination hotel in San Francisco. It is situated right on Union Square, within easy walking distance of Chinatown, shopping, the cable car and great restaurants. We believe that this is the best location in the city. In addition to the location, the Hyatt has the best bar in San Francisco---overlooking the Golden Gate and Alcatraz, I believe only available on the Club level.",8-Aug-11,5
"Even though the hotel is in the midst of renovation, it is still a wonderful place. Try to get the restaurant view on the top before they, sadly, move it to the mezzanine. Ask for a high floor, the views are spectacular!",6-Aug-11,5
"Located in downtown San Francisco, ideal place. Near Powell cable car line, at the base of Nob Hill.Unimpressed with lobby, rooms are small. Bathrooms are adequate.Good breakfast upstairs with amazing views. Service is as expected for this class of hotel. Prepared to pay over $300/night.",3-Aug-11,3
"We had problems nearly every time trying to use the hotel elevator. We were on the 7th floor and by the time the elevator reached us 85% of the time it was already full (during normal hours) and it took usually around 7 minutes of waiting just to show up. Most of the time we just trekked on down the stairs, but they really should have a better system. Maybe they stop using some of the elevators during the weekdays, but it was ridiculous.I found the beds to be very comfortable! The bathrooms are odd and there is a sliding door that never really closes all the way so you can hear everything out in the bedroom if you know what I mean. The location is excellent. There is a Starbucks right across the street, Union Square, Chinatown and North Beach are all within walking distance. Be careful. The hotel charges $56 a day for parking. We just used the Sutter Stockton garage on the corner and it ended up averaging out at $21 a day.",2-Aug-11,3
"My husband and I stayed for five nights and it was wonderful. We used the AAA rate which included breakfast. Our room was on the 23rd floor and we had a fantastic view of Coit Tower and Alcatraz. Breakfast on the 36th floor every morning was excellent and you could get french toast, waffles, or eggs to order in addition to the buffet. The room had been recently refurbished and it was very modern with wonderful shades that could be raised or lowered from the bed. But the best part was the wonderful staff: front desk, bellman, housekeeping, waiters, and the concierge desk. Two in particular, Joanne and I believe Lisa, were not just helpful, but also very patient in providing daily maps outlining the transit options. We will definitely be back!",1-Aug-11,5
"I was in San Francisco for another business trip and decided to try a different Hyatt in SF (instead of Hyatt Regency San Francisco by Embarcadero Center). The Grand Hyatt was right at Union Sqaure and closed to everything - shopping, food, cable car and yes.... financial district. Folks at the front desk was very helpful and the checkin was very fast.",30-Jul-11,4
"We stayed here three nights during the last weekend in July and had adjoining rooms for our party of four. The room had a fantastic view which was a great start. The problem was the housekeeping and the staff in general. The housekeeping started knocking on doors at 8am on a Saturday and Sunday morning to see if they could clean the room. 8AM !! on a weekend!On day we put the privacy out to keep them from knocking and then they didn't clean the rooms at all. For the price and the hype, I expected better staff.",30-Jul-11,3
"The Hyatt was recently refurbished and the rooms are very comfortable. Everyone was smiley and extremely helpful. The views from the rooms are wonderful and we were fortunate enough to overlook Union Square. They also provide a fridge in the room as well as coffee facilities. They charge for wifi.The location is in the centre of everything. We had breakfast in the dining room which is on the thirty something floor where we again were fortunate enough to have a table by the window. The service,by George, was impeccable and made breakfast that much more enjoyable. No point in going out for breakfast when it is this good with this view where you are! The only disappoinment is the bathroom where the towels and toiletries are not particularly good. Of course we will stay there again!",30-Jul-11,5
"My fiance and I stayed here for 2 nights, the location is right next to Union Square (only less than 1 block from Macys. It's a block from Chinatown in a very lively area. This hotel recently underwent a $38million renovation project and the rooms has flat screen TVs, contemporary designed rooms. It's a decent size for being in the city, bathroom is spacious. Self parking structure is very convenient just right across the street, it's about $38 i think. it's expensive but parking in SF is expensive no matter where you go. The bed is comfortable as we had great night sleep. Room is nice and clean. i would come back and stay here again.",29-Jul-11,5
"Very nice place, close to lots of amenities, family friendly.Even on 16 fl can hear some street noise, if you have the City view.",29-Jul-11,5
"The Grand Hyatt has an awesome location, right by all of the shops and restaraunts. The area was very safe and I could get everywhere I needed by car. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, as far as concierges go one was awesome and one didn't really help me much so if you don't get the answers you want, go back and try again when someone else is working.Rooms were very nice, roomy, and clean. Nice small touches, like free tooth paste in the room! Doesn't seem like a big deal, but it was important to me since I forgot mine! My only complaint about the room was the shower which had extremely low water pressure. If you're on a low floor, chances are you won't have a view of anything but the building next door but if you go up to the upper floors the views are amazing. The work out center was extremely nice with lots of equipment to choose from and had by far the best view I've ever seen from a gym. I wanted to keep going back to work out just for the view! We only ate at the hotel once (for breakfast), we ate the buffet since we were in a hurry but it was over priced and not that good. French toast was tasty though, and again... the view was worth it. Even if you just get a snack or a drink, make sure you go up there! I took some amazing pictures through the windows (turn off your flash), and no one would ever know that I took them from inside the building.",29-Jul-11,5
"I had stayed there 6 days. Near all. Shops, restaurants, transport. It was a great location.Safe. I had breakfast included. excellent. Hotel`s staff great. Value very reasonable. I surely recomend this hotel.",29-Jul-11,5
"I stayed at Grand Hyatt with a group of friends for four nights in June.... really enjoyed the hotel and all SF has to offer. The rooms are clean and modern, check in was a breeze... loved the salt water taffy at the front desk- nice touch! We had a little mishap with the swipe system on our door- we were locked out of our room completely and it took several maintenance men to fix the problem. Despite the inconvenience they offered us another room to use while we could not get in ours and had the problem fixed in about a half hour. Was grumpy about that after a tiring full day of tours but they did their best to resolve the problem quickly and professionally. The top level lounge offered beautiful views and some tasty appetizers. The concierge was very helpful when asked for advice on places to eat or best means of transportation. Overall I really enjoyed this hotel, the location is fantastic and with the new upgrades its a very comfortable, enjoyable place to stay while visiting beautiful San Francisco!",28-Jul-11,5
"Centrally located, great room with mini refrigerator and wonderful views.We also dined in the Grand View restaurant and the food was good and the views were 'grand'.",28-Jul-11,5
"This hotel has the most amazing views of San Francisco. The top floor bar and restaurant is a must see. Room are very nice and big enough. Service was also more than decent. Very important to business travelers, internet connection. No issues there either. I would most certainly book this hotel again.",28-Jul-11,5
"I have stayed at 3 different properties at Union Square and the Grand Hyatt has been my favorite in the past. And, now that they are nearly complete on amazing renovations, they are over the top. They have great windows, basically floor to ceiling, so the city/bay views are fantastic. And, with the recently redone rooms, the comfort and ambience is spectacular and many push button features including curtains, lights, etc. I highly recommend this hotel as it has the typical Hyatt courtesies, plus with the new renovation, it is just the best. Am staying again at the end of September.",28-Jul-11,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt during the week of July 18, 2011. The room was great and was decorated with modern yet comfortable furnishings. The bathroom had this really funky looking vessell sink. The only thing was the sink was a bit shallow and I would splash water everywhere when using it.The hotel location was right in the midst of some really great shopping and was within about a mile to a mile and a half to the water front. We walked to the waterfront a couple of times. It was a good and easy walk but be prepared for it to be chilly in the evening.The only drawback to the stay was on our arrival, the bellman was a bit aggressive in trying to set expectations about how long it takes to get a taxi. My co-worker and I had just arrived and was trying to pay our taxi driver, get our stuff out of the car and figure out how much time we had before our first meeting. I assume that the bellman was trying to be helpful and set expectations but he didn't allow us to get out of the cab good before he began bombarding us with the drawbacks of the taxi situation in San Francisco.We were guests of the hotel when a pretty major union was picketing. Though I support the picketers, I do have to commend the hotel lobby and bellman staff for how they tried to make the hotel guests feel safe, secure and avoid the picket as much as possible. On the day of the picket, they were all organized, in large numbers and escorted guests from the curb to the elevators. They definitely took extra care noting the inconvenience to the guests but remained calm and in control.I would definitely stay there again and would recommend this hotel. Good price and service.",28-Jul-11,4
"Great hotel for business stay - close proximity to everything, expansive conference facilities. Rooms are clean, pleasantly-appointed and well-proportioned. The concierge is very efficient and courteous. The only wrinkle (apart from my pet peeve of SF hotels blocking the free city-provided Wi-Fi access, which I think is ridiculous) is the noise that the entire structure was emanating. According to the hotel management, due to high winds, many buildings creak in the same way. It might be true, but when you're on the 6th floor of a modern hotel building, and it sounds like you're on deck of a Flying Dutchman, it is bound to scare the Bejaysus out of ya. I can only gasp and guess what the noise was for the higher-floor guests.",28-Jul-11,4
"I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Union Square area. It's location has easy access to transportation to cable cars or street cars (2 - 4 blocks walking) We were able to check in early which made our arrival very nice. The hotel is decorated in a very simple classy style. The hotel desk help and all around personnel were very pleasant. Room size was okay and the view (12th floor) was okay. We could see a peek of the bay in the distance. We were never disturbed by hearing other hotel guests in other rooms. I would have thought we were the only ones on our floor if I didn't see the used food service trays outside. Being on the 12th floor we did still hear a lot of the street traffic noise (all night). Room was very clean. During our stay there, the Hyatt hotel cleaning staff had a demonstration outside the hotel one afternoon. We were worried that we could not enter the hotel. I would have expected the hotel to offer us some kind of discount in hotel bill or restaurant to help assuage the situation, but did not. As others have reported the view from the 36th floor is pretty incredible. You do have to pick a time of day though when the fog has not rolled in tho! Also there is not a lobby area where you can sit and relax. The hotel has close proximity to many many restaurants. Most are a bit pricey but we were able to find some them that were more moderately priced.",26-Jul-11,5
We rented a car traffic was very busy they like to honk a lot!. There's not much time to make right turns due to all the pedestrians. We will definitely take taxis next time or ride the trolleys. Mass transist system is convenient to the hotel.,25-Jul-11,5
"As frequent SF visitors we have passed this hotel numerous times and finally decided to give it a try. We were so pleased!! The newly renovated room was beautiful, unusual and the bed was so-o comfortable. Everyone at the holel could not have been more accommodating. Housekeeping did an outstanding job and we were never inconvenienced. We had one minor problem which was handled quickly and to our satisfaction. This hotel has the best location for what we enjoy doing when in San Francisco (and it's not shopping). We are so glad we stayed here and look forward to returning.",25-Jul-11,5
"The room was fully renovated and absolutely immaculate and gorgeous. We had a King size bed that was very comfortable. We were on the 7th floor and had no street noise. We ate breakfast and lunch in the restaurant at the top of the hotel, it was delicious with a beautiful view of the city. The concierge was very helpful and suggested several great places to eat within walking distance. We took a double decker bus tour out to the Golden Gate Bridge which was excellent and reasonably priced. We are Platinum members so there was no charge for the internet service, if you are not in Hyatt's loyalty program, then sign up, it is free. This is our third time staying at this hotel and we have never been disappointed.",24-Jul-11,4
The hotel is all renovated and the rooms are very clean and well maintained. The hotel is by Union Square so it is create for transportation and dining etc. We were travelling as a family of 4 and found that the storage space was limited. The space that would typically be used as drawers for clothing were replaced with a fridge and a safe. I was also suprised how noisy the hotel was. You could hear the movement in the hall and outside the window. The internet was sooo slow. We called for assistance and someone even came to our room but they could not make it any faster. The service was great. All staff were very friendly and provided great service. So overall great room and location but a few things I would change.,21-Jul-11,4
"Excellent location! Stayed here on a long labor day weekend back in 2006 but still remember the great location of this hotel! Nice room, clean and comfortable bed. It looks like more of a business hotel but still a great hotel for a stay in San Francisco. Right in Union Square and walking distance to so much including good shopping, trolley ride, Chinatown, etc. Only problem we had was as soon as we checked in, we went up to our room and were laying on the bed when one of the staff came into our hotel room on accident. Guess they didn't know anyone was in there?",18-Jul-11,4
"2 day July stay was very nice-well appointed rooms-brand new. Clean, quiet, state of the art. Bar on 35th floor fantastic-lively, fun! Views are crazy good.Bell staff most helpful. Plenty of reasons to return again",18-Jul-11,5
"we were in SFO for the 4th of July wknd and stayed the grand hyatt for 3 nights. locaion was great, central location. we took the bart train from the airport to the powell st station and the hotel was a 10 min walk from there ( 4 blocks). we could also walk to Coit tower (through china town and north beach) and to fishermans warf. lots of great restaurants in the neighbourhood too. the grand view restaurant on the 36th floor has great views of SF sky line, alcatraz and city. The rooms we stayed in were the updated/new rooms and was very comfortable and contemporary. fast internet connection helped as well. all in all great stay and will repeat at this hotel again.",15-Jul-11,4
"Definately would return and enjoyed the entire experience.There was an initial problem finding availability for the type of room reserved, but the front desk clerk was most accommadating by providing a complimentary breakfast each morning. Staff members were professional, curtious, and ready to help right away if needed.The room was well appointed, very clean, modern, and had wonderful mattresses and linens. The view from the room was great but the view from the 36th floor restaurant was spectacular, especially at sunset. The hotel was centrally located at Union Square and not far from public transportation, but a tip for catching a cab.... start early... it's not easy to get a cab like in other cities.",13-Jul-11,5
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a weekend getaway to San Francisco. We loved it! The location was terrific. It's right in the heart of the shopping area, it's surrounded by great restaurants and Chinatown is just a few blocks away. We had considered staying near Fisherman's wharf and after seeing the area, I'm so glad we didn't. The rooms looked newly renovated and he hotel was very clean We would definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt.",13-Jul-11,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Fran last week for our wedding anniversary, and loved every minute of it. When we arrived, we were able to quickly check in. (favorite part of the front desk was the salt water taffy mints that i reguarly helped myself to!!!!) We had a lovely freshly rennovated king sized room on the 16th floor. Amazing bed! The only thing I didnt like in the hotel room was the smell of the hand soap, shampoo, and conditioner, but i had some of my own, so if you are particular, bring your own supplies! The concerge staff was 100% amazing in helping us make our plans.... one was nicer than the next in helping us with whatever questions we had. The other great thing about this hotel is the location..... steps away from wonerful shopping stores, the MUNI (bus and underground) and cable cars. A few blocks away and you stumble into Chinatown. i felt very safe here in the Union Square area...... can't say that about other ""districts"" or neighborhoods we visited. There was nothing lavish about this hotel, but it just meet all of my needs of being in a great loaction, being super clean, and having insanely nice people helping me. But beware, dont bother to ask for an upgrade if you book your stay through any site other than their own. My husband emailed someone before we left (trying to make our trip a little more special) and was, in my opinion, rather rudely denied because we booked through Travelocity. It just kinda made me feel ""second-class"". I almost would have prefered being lied to that no rooms were available. So then when we did check in, i felt like there was a big mark by our name that said ""discount-website trash checking in"" Alright, I dramatize a little. I just needed to get that off my chest. I would still stay here again, and truely suggest you do to, because again: it's in the perfect location, the place is immaculately clean, and the concerge staff were amazing. A few quick thoughts on San Fran in general..... it's cold! I guess especially in July/August.... so bring a jacket and pants! The sun is brutal and will burn you instantaneusly, so wear your sunscreen and wear a hat! The city is a bunch of wicked steep hills, so bring and wear the most comfortably shoes you have---- fashion be damned, those hills are evil! Food is super expensive and really not that good. Public transportation is cheaper in San Fran than Chicago- even taxi's! Bus fare is 2 bucks and it's good for 2 hours! Cable cars are a rip off 6 bucks for one ride, but most of the time they never ask you for money! I highly reccomend a hop on hop off bus tour when you first get there to get your bearings. Again, beware: when you cross over the Golden Gate Bridge, IT WILL BE COLD! And finally, if you are looking for a tour of Sonoma and the Wine country, please take the GREEN DREAMS TOUR with Ellie, it's the best.Sorry this is so long, and I really hope this helps someone. Please stay at the Grand Hyatt, it was a very nice clean safe place to stay!",12-Jul-11,5
"This is the second time I've stayed here, and the first since the guestrooms were renovated. I got a great rate and was overall quite pleased with my experience. Pluses: Fabulously comfortable bed. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Union Square. Nice 24-hour fitness room, immaculately maintained and with top-notch cardio equipment. Friendly and helpful staff, including concierges, front desk, doormen. Convenient location in Union Square, near cable cars, shopping, Theater District, North Beach, etc.Minuses: I could hear a bit of hammering where they were doing some work. But it wasn't too loud. Bathrobes: A hotel of this calibre should provide bathrobes, as well as shower caps. Not crazy about the Portico bath amenities - don't like the fragrance, but no big deal. And, of course, the usual gripe: They shouldn't charge for Wi-Fi!",9-Jul-11,4
The only issue We had is the wifi is not free ?!?! Really. ??? Ok but we loved it ,8-Jul-11,4
"The wonderful room with breath-taking views made our recent trip to SF a special one! The newly remodeled rooms with elegant, modern furnishings were spectacular. The gorgeously appointed bathroom with top-of-the-line fixtures and stone was extravagant! We booked through AAA, and a full breakfast was included with our stay (a delicious deal). The hotel is located within walking distance to the underground, Chinatown and close by shopping. After an exhausting day of business, movies, drinks AND a Giant's game, we dropped into a deep sleep in the decadent bed. Slept soundly and comfortably. Would definately recommend staying here!",6-Jul-11,5
"We had a pleasant one night stay here. It's been renovated recently, which is nice, but I can see how for some, the smell of new paint and decor might be bothersome. If you are sensitive to that, wait a while to stay here! I absolutely loved the mini-bathtub sink, as I find that sinks at most hotels are too small. Wifi is available in the room, but I believe it's USD10.00. The good thing is that there's a Starbucks right across from the hotel, so you could go there.",4-Jul-11,4
"Union Square is a great location to use a home base for a stay in San Francisco! We asked for, and got, a high level room (25th floor, out of 36, not bad), and although it was a west looking view, it was very nice! The room itself was redone and very modern! A bit of a negative was how thin the walls seemed to be ... the people in the next room sounded like they were actually in our room ... not what you'd expect from a high-end hotel.I was very impressed by the conceirge service! We hadn't been to San Francisco for many years and needed some direction with local restaurants and sights. Joanna Husk (Concierge and Member of Les Clefs d'Or USA Ltd.) was possibly the best conceirge I've ever dealt with. She took the time to understand what we were interested in and provided us with maps, site-seeing suggestions, and an extensive list of restaurants within walking distance ... then she gave us specific recommendations to meet our interests. It's this type of service that makes you want to come back to a hotel!As far as location, it was ideal. Easy to walk just about anywhere, as long as you have the time and stamina, up and down the hills! We walked to Nob Hill, Telegraph Hill, Fisherman's Wharf, and Ghiradelli Square. A beautiful city!!One of the great features of the hotel is Grandviews restaurant, on the 36th floor. I probably wouldn't recommend it for dinner, but what a great view for breakfast!!! Our room rate included breakfast for 2 each day (anything you want) ... all you have to pay for is the tip ... a good deal!Parking is another issue, but I'd recommend passing on the valet parking (way overpriced!) and park at the garage on the opposite corner of Stockton and Sutter streets ... right across from the hotel. Although it wasn't cheep, it was very convenient and much less than valet. We spent a day over in Golden Gate Park, and then over to the Golden Gate Bridge (which are too far to walk) and it was great to have the car accessable.I know it's still ""par for the course"" at high-end hotels, but why do they charge for internet service? I'd highly recommend that they make this a free service, just like they do at most lower level and business hotels!All in all a very pleasureable experience!",3-Jul-11,4
"I've stayed here a few times and every time was a great experience. Great location and everything in the hotel is up to date and modern. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. The gym is spacious with modern equipment. The price is obviously a little high, but they sometimes have good deals even during peak season.",3-Jul-11,5
"The staff treated you like you were at the Ritz Carlton! Exceptional customer service. Would highly recommend staying there. Rooms have recently been redone--beautiful with beautiful views of the city and bay....Again, the staff went out of their way to may our stay exceptional!! Only thing I would change is they need to offer free internet!!",30-Jun-11,5
"I stayed in a newly refurbished room. Very well appointed.The concierge service at this hotel was wonderful. Like a private guide looking after your every need. Once the teamunderstood what experiences I was looking for, they never missed the mark. Restaurant recommendations and bookings in particular.Thanks team, I'll be back.",29-Jun-11,5
Hyatt Grand is a great hotel if you want to stay right in the heart of SF. Steps away from Union Square...you can't beat the location.Service was great during my stay. Rooms seem recently renovated and were very nice. The only complaint was you could hear a bit of street noise. All in All a great place to stay in SF.,28-Jun-11,4
"Highly recommend this hotel for a San Fransisco Stay. Great location for shopping, restaurants and site seeing. Our room was newly renovated and very clean. All of the staff from the Valet to the Housekeeping Staff was very helpful.",27-Jun-11,5
"The Grand Hyatt hotel rooms have been newly renovated. The concierge was so helpful and nice! The cleaning staff was also nice. Although we had to call maintenance 3 separate times for a few plumbing issues, it didn't change our views of the hotel. Even the maintenance men were as nice as could be! Check in and out was a breeze. It's located in the heart of Union Square with a Walgreen's around the corner for anything you may need or forgotten. Restaurants & shopping galore. Easy walk to cable cars & public transportation. Room was elegant. Loved it!!! We stayed a week and it was barely enough time to see everything we wanted to. Great family vacation with teens & young adults.",26-Jun-11,5
"My wife and I spent two nights at this hotel and enjoyed our stay. Location was convenient within walking distance of shopping, restaurants and the Muni and BART. The staff was friendly and accomodating from the moment we exited our car to check in as the valet moved our car out of traffic. The check-in process was smooth and kiosks were available to issue room keys if you check in online. We checked out online due to an early flight and the process was also very easy. Room was clean and decorated with contemporary flair. The AC was nice since the temp reached 86 during our trip. We also enjoyed the 35th floor exercise facility. Good cardio equipment and a great view.",24-Jun-11,5
"A great stay from the moment we arrived. Doormen were so happy and polite, always had time to chat.Checkin was fast and professional, as we were early were given an upgrade to a room on a higher level, wow the view was amazing. Looking down to union square or out to the Golden Gate Bridge it never ceased to amaze. The room wa small but very nicely appointed and comfortable and the location for walkig around was brilliant. The restaurant on the top floor at night was brilliant, had to be one of the best views in the city. Gym was good as well.",21-Jun-11,4
"The Grand Hyatt is a good hotel in an excellent location just off Union Square, and walking distance from Chinatown. The Continental Breakfast was excellent and (for a major city centre0 not too expensive, and the view from the top floor restaurant spectacular. We stayed in a refurbished room which looked splendid, but for a couple staying more than one night it lacked storage space (drawers particularly) and the bathroom had a large elongated basin ( could have bathed a small baby) which detracted from space for toiletries etc. Also there was nowhere to hang towels, making the ""green"" admonishment to reuse towels unworkable - no good leaving them in a soggy heap!Useful facility to print boarding passes for onward flights in the lobby.",16-Jun-11,4
"couple of nights stay here. room fairly standard chain type placeroom clean and tidy ok view, not great.comfy bed and very quiet hotel.the bar at the top of the hotel was great and had great views and better cocktails!staff were very friendly.excellent location just off union square and with the rate we got which worked out at about Â£85 a night, fantastic value.",14-Jun-11,4
"Took a few rooms out during the busy season mid-June with some friends. I wanted to give this hotel 4 stars but just couldn't justify it on a few factors. See below:PROS- Superb location at Union Square- Renovated rooms nice quality, modern fitouts- Excellent concierges- Good housekeeping staff- Reasonable prompt responses to service callsCONS- Takes some work to get bell hops to help with bags (they need to staff more for such a busy hotel)- Checkin at front desk had a long wait and was slow (again, they need to staff more)- Breakfast buffet is expensive and is not good value for what you get- Parking is absurdly priced- Internet is an extra $10/day when it should be complimentary- Room service menu is minimalBottom line is that this hotel has great potential given it's superb Union Square location and newly renovated rooms which bring the facility up to what you expect from a flagship Grand Hyatt property in San Fran. However, I had difficulty feeling I was getting good value for money given all the extras they charge for and some of the noticable shortcomings as listed above.",13-Jun-11,3
"My business partner and I were in San Francisco for a business conference this month. Though the event was held at the Westin Market, we decided to try out the Grand Hyatt a few blocks away.We couldn't have been happier with the experience. We got an AAA rate that included breakfast, which was quite a steal, as the hotel restaurant on the 36th floor is very impressive. The breakfast buffet was slightly above average, nothing to write home about but perfectly adequate.Upon check-in, make sure to request a renovated room. From the looks of it, they're almost done with the upgrades, but parts of the hotel are still out of service. Our room was great with a nice view of the Transamerica Pyramid and surrounding areas.Note to those who care: The club is currently out of service for renovations.This hotel does charge for internet, just like every other property in its class in San Francisco. Acting shocked about it won't change anything. ;-)",13-Jun-11,5
"The hotel was clean, modern and had great views. The location cannot be beat if you're looking to be close to Union Square, Chinatown and the action of the City life. The front desk staff was pleasant and kind... but there was a wait of about 5-10 minutes at both check-in and check-out. The front desk agents were spot on and apologized for the wait and took care of us very efficiently and with great service.My only real disappointment came at the concierge desk. It was very, very busy and after a couple of unsuccessful calls and a 10 minute wait at the desk, I was a little disappointed in the service and attention (that I did not end up with) for a simple question. Thankfully, I'm pretty familiar with the City and it was only an inconvenience, not something that ruined our trip by any means. I found another way to get the information elsewhere. All in all, it was a nice stay.",13-Jun-11,4
"Great location, customer service and clean. I think I will continue to stay at the Grand Hyatt.",13-Jun-11,5
"I stayed June 5th, 2011, in a King room on the 17th floor. Everything was brand new, clean, and gorgeous. Super comfy bed, great lighting options on the headboard, big TV, good chairs. Loved the curtains, pillows, white ginger soaps. I would certainly return should I need to spend time in San Francisco.Only gripes: Shower water-pressure a little feeble, breakfast not included, and I resent paying a dollar to make a land-line phone call. Oh, and leave your car at home. Parking charges downtown are exorbitant.",10-Jun-11,5
I stayed for 5 nights at the hotel. I travel to SFO three times a year staying nomally at Westin St. Francis or Sir Francis Drake. And will return to one of those going forward. The room was very old..the furniture was scrathed up. The TV was archaic. The construction noise started each moring at 630a. I travel frequently and the bed was not good at all. I ended up with a sore neck which never happens even at selective service hotels.The hotel service was adequate. There is no gift shop which then requires you exit hotel to Walgreens.I was charged for an upgraded room post my hotel stay but they did refund the second charge when I called.Room service was fine.,9-Jun-11,2
"I stayed here for two nights and found this to be an ideal base during my trip to San Francisco. Even though it is a big hotel, check-in was done in under 5 minutes thanks to the automated kiosk! My room was big for a city hotel with a great view of downtown (although I had asked for a bay view..I guess the tiny sliver of water out towards Oakland was supposed to count). The bed was super comfortable and the room had a nice size flat screen TV, comfy lounge chair and ample desk space for laptop etc. There was also a mini-fridge which was great for storing drinks and snacks. The bathroom was very clean and everything worked well in there. I am not a huge fan of the sliding doors that seem to be so popular now - I know they save space, but I prefer more privacy... Room service was quick and really tasty. I also appreciated that all staff at the hotel referred to me by name. All of them from the housekeeping staff to the front desk were very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is great - smack dab in Union Square where you can find plenty of breakfast spots and of course tons of shopping. BART stations, cable cars, taxis are easy to reach for when you want to explore other parts of the city. Definitely a great spot and would recommend it to anyone staying in San Francisco who wants a classy but not snobby place to stay.",9-Jun-11,4
"We stayed here because we got a great deal on the room but there not really much else to this hotel. This is a four star hotel thats' standard rooms are tiny, beds are small and not all that comfortable and the front desk doesn't make you feel all that welcome. I guess it was the rate I got, but it's still money isn't it? They offer absolutely nothing complimentary not even internet service, which I think is ridiculous. You even have to pay to use the business center. The hotel is in a decent location with many fine places to eat within walking distance. The support staff was good and the concierge was great, especially Liz. But if this is a four star hotel, I'll stay with the two and three star locales because at least they respect the money your spending and offer you some extras besides a great looking lobby. Not recommended.",6-Jun-11,3
"While searching on various OTAs for a place to stay over Memorial Day weekend, I chanced upon a 48hr sale advertised by the Grand Hyatt, and thought it was worth a try. My husband and I arrived earlier than normal check-in time and were prepared to have our bag stored prior to receiving a room key; but not only was the room ready, our request for a higher floor had been granted. Furthermore, the front desk associate presented us with a couple of room options to make sure we received what we truly wanted. The room was absolutely stunning, very cosmopolitan, very chic. Totally adored the contemporary decor and furnishings that capture a loft-style, urban residence luxury. Appreciated the chic features like the window shade and personal bedside reading lights. The Grandviews Lounge has a wonderful ambiance, great music, and exudes serenity despite it being full. The door/bell staff were most pleasant and very attentive, always made sure we were comfortable and checked if we needed assistance. We're glad to have found a favorite place to stay in Union Square. Keep up the great work!",1-Jun-11,5
Very updated rooms in this hotel. The room darkens with an electric shade. Hardwood flooring and very modern light fixtures. The customer care provided from the bell staff to the front desk shows that they are well trained and these employees like their job!!.Noise is a problem in the middle of the city with all the horns and sirens....but it is San Francisco.,1-Jun-11,1
"We picked this hotel because it was reasonably priced and in a good location. We chose a Club Room because of the free breakfast and the nice ambiance. Anyway, after we reserved the room, we found out the hotel was undergoing renovation and the club level rooms weren't renovated yet. So we chose to stay in a renovated regular room. The bed was very comfortable. However, the new decor was beautiful -- very modern but a little cold -- just not my style. Great TV and absolutely enough plugs (very important to me for charging cell phone/laptop/etc.) The ""club room"" was set up in a regular room -- good choices and good service, but it was really a disappointment. This was a beginning of a special vacation from us -- we should have chosen better. Also, some of the halls had a terrible turpentine (?) smell -- from paint? Anyway, I won't stay there again.",26-May-11,3
"Visited San Francisco on the 4th May for 5 nights as part of a trip along with Hawaii and New York. Arrived tired 7 hours later than expected due to delayed flight, we were checked in very efficiently and in a friendly manner and went to our renovated room on the 23rd floor. The beds were the most comfortable I have slept in ( I have a memory foam at home and it was better than mine). Elaine at the concierge desk booked trips for us and went out of her way to be helpful and friendly, visited the restaurant on 36th floor, views fantastic and cocktails in bar good too. Would certainly stay here again and highly recommend a visit",24-May-11,5
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a week from April 16. We had a great stay. We arrived at the hotel around 11pm and check in was swift. The location was very convinient. Starbucks is just across the street, Walgreens is a block away and Chinatown is close by. Shopping is all over. The hallways to the rooms were nicely decorated. The newly renovated rooms were a bit small but comfortable. I like the way the bathrooms were done. I read in one review that it was alittle noisy especially if you stayed in rooms facing Sutter. Well, when we were there we had that problem the night after we arrived the rest of nights was quiet. I think it was also because they were fixing the roads outside and they were working at night. The all staffs very very friendly and helpful. I haven't had a chance to check out the coffee shop on the top floor but I heard it has great views of the city. We also used the internet. We had to pay for it but the connections were ok.",16-May-11,4
"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights at the end of April 2011. We were dealt with by a very professional and friendly member of staff who checked us in and welcomed us. We were given a renovated room on the 11th floor which overlooked Union Square. The renovated rooms are brilliant. Extremely clean and modern with lots of nice little touches to make your stay comfortable. We had a room with 1 king bed which provided 5 of the best nights sleep I have ever had. Whilst I never saw one of the older rooms, I would definitely request one of the renovated rooms when you check in. Location is perfect with easy access to the main bus and street car routes on Market Street and also the Cable Cars. It is also right in the centre of the main shopping areas with Macys over the square and Westfield Mall about a 10 minute walk.We went to the 36th floor bar on our last night for cocktails and the views are stunning. We got a seat in the window and was there just in time to see the last bit of the sun sinking into the bay. The drinks were pretty good too!!Throughout our stay, whenever we needed anything, I found the staff to be helpful, efficient and extremely polite. I would definitely recommend this hotel and if I am ever fortunate enough to be back in beautiful San Francisco, I will stay at the Grand Hyatt.",9-May-11,5
"Located just off union square, location great, nice view but a bit pricey but maybe thats just San Francisco prices. Food and drinks in the bar good but bit expensive but nice bar and great view of the city and Alcatraz.Room service breakfast was lovely, good size room and bathroom and very clean.Had to pay for wireless internet which I think was a bit unfair given the price we paid for the room. Free wireless internet would have increased the rating I give here",8-May-11,4
"My husband and I spent 3 nights in this hotel as part of our honeymoon. We had a room on the 29th floor so we had a fantastic view of the city. We did think at first that the room, although clean, was in need of modernisation. It then became apparent at around 7.30am the next morning that the hotel was being renovated when we were awoken by drilling and banging from either the floor above or the floor below. Not exactly perfect for a honeymoon destination! We mentioned the noise at reception and were told that the workmen did not usually start until 9am so we were asked to call down and ask to speak to the manager the next day if the noise started earlier than this. There was no noise the next day which was fine. However, on our last morning, the drilling noise and associated banging began at 7.45 and was so loud that eventually I felt that I had to leave the room without drying my hair or packing my suitcase properly. We complained at reception once more and were offered lunch or dinner as compensation. As we are from the Uk, this was completely unsuitable and after checking with her supervisor, the receptionist kindly refunded us for one night's stay. Although we had a less than comfortable experience at this hotel, I think we were just unlucky. The modernised floors look great and the location is perfect. The fact that we were here on honeymoon made our experience worse. Had either of us been on business, we would have left the room before the renovation work began so would have been unaffected by it.",7-May-11,3
"It was our first stay in San Francisco and wow what an impression it left. from the moment we arrived we were well looked after. The receptionist was great and gave us a lovely room, the card machine wasn't working at the time so couldn't give us a key to our room but arranged a member of staff to take us to the room and let us in. The room itself was gorgeous, on the 30th floor with great views. The room was spotlessly clean and each day the housekeeping team done a wonderful job to maintain this fact. The conciege team were FANTASTIC! they recommended some great places to eat, told us how to get around and answered all our questions... and we had quite a few. I can not thank them enough and the whole Hyatt team for a fantastic stay.",5-May-11,5
"We chose the lowest rate and got a beautiful room, 16th floor, over Union Square. The remodeling is well done, loved the unusual panels, in place of sheer curtains, and the automated shades. The built in bed headboards and built in desk/tv/etc... made much better use of the space that in the old-style rooms and gave more room to move around.The front desk and concierge staff were courteous and efficient, and our phone requests for extra things were filled immediately.We found the hotel perfect in every way, and the location cannot be beat.",4-May-11,5
"This is by far one of the worst Hyatt's. Yes, they are renovating their rooms - this is long overdue for this hotel. The level of customer service is not up to par with the other Grand Hyatt's I have stayed at. The management approach at this property is clearly different from the others. The front desk staff is the worst. They appear to really care less about whether you have an enjoyable stay or not. Renovated room or not, the walls are paper thin and you very likely will not be getting a good nights sleep. I am a Diamond Member with Hyatt and always try to stay at Hyatt to maintain my status. Not here though...I've switched to the Fairmont on Nob Hill. Fantastic hotel, great service, and great location.",30-Apr-11,1
"The hotel was in a great location, the room was very nice and comfortable, and the staff excelled at customer service. Elaine the concierge helped us book a fantastic napa trip after the one I booked online canceled the evening before. The rest of the staff genuinely cared to make sure we were happy. The thirty sixth floor restaurant and bar had awesome views of the city. The gym is on the next floor down and had the same views with brand new equipment.",24-Apr-11,5
"The location of the Grand Hyatt is just about perfect. The newly updated rooms are done very well. They obviously paid attention to how people travel today. There are very adequate and accessible places to plug in electronics, an iHome station to recharge and use your iPhone, a safe which accommodates a laptop, a mini fridge and toothpaste as an amenity in the bathroom. The new furnishings are comfortable an having the shade electronically controlled from the bedside is great. The only downside to the hotel is that it's really only a place to sleep. But everything you could want is close by (restaurants, shopping, spas etc). The restaurant/lounge on the top floor needs an update. It has great potential with its beautiful views. It's definitely my go to hotel in San Francisco.",24-Apr-11,4
"We were at the 12th floor, I liked the view from our room. The room was totally renovated, bath was beautiful, very modern, the bed was comfy, the staff was very kind and helpful. The location is great, but you can hear the street noise during the night. It was a great week, thank you for everything! :)",19-Apr-11,5
"Agree with an earlier poster about requesting renovated rooms ONLY. This is an older property and therefore has it ups/downs. The location is great - only one block off Union Square and four blocks from the BART Station (which means you can come in from the airport for $8.10 instead of a $40 cab ride). The renovated rooms have all new furnishings, although the bathroom design is indicative of a renovation (small, tight). You can hear some noise through the walls, but you'll still sleep well due to the new beds. The lobby and elevators look worn, but once you arrive on your renovated floor it will be like stepping into a new hotel. The Executive Lounge was beautiful and had a breakfast serving fit for a king - definitely one of the nicest lounges I've seen in a long time. I would stay here again, but this time will request a renovated room upon making a reservation!",19-Apr-11,3
"I stayed here for 3 weeknights in March 2011. At that time the hotel was undergoing renovations in places. I was given the choice of a renovated room or a room with a great view. I took the view (30th floor of 36). The room did indeed have a great view toward the bay and financial district but it did need some modernization. Tube TV, dated curtains, worn dressers/doors, straight shower curtain bar, and worn carpeting were some of the items needing an update. However, everything worked, the bed was comfortable, the shower had great pressure and plenty of hot water, and the room was quiet. So for this yet-to-be-renovated room the pluses outweighed the minuses.I had a car and parked it in a garage around the corner from the hotel for $35/day which is high but not as much as the hotel valet service. That garage by the way, is clean and the attendants are courteous and professional.The restaurant on the top floor has fantastic views of the city and beyond. The service was top notch and not rushed if you didn't want to be rushed. The full breakfast buffet with gratuity was $22-$24 which was about the same price as a late evening burger, beer, and gratuity.Lots of dining of all types within a five minute walk - Starbucks across the street, cafes on Union Square 1/2 block away, Lori's Diner (50s theme) is a block or so away, and many others.Overall a very nice hotel and I'd recommend it to anyone.",10-Apr-11,4
"When I book a hotel, I look for one thing: value for my dollar. I got all I could ask for and more from the Grand Hyatt. The service was amazing. We brought our bags to the Hyatt at 7am to be stowed for the day while we did some sightseeing, but the front desk told us that they would go ahead and give us a room so we could get settled in.We had a wonderful view of Union Square, and the bed was very comfortable. I definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking high-class treatment and service at an affordable and reasonable price! (Especially in San Francisco!)",8-Apr-11,5
This was a great hotel. Great service! Great rooms! Great Value! Great View! Great location!!! Will stay again at the right price!! Hehehe,7-Apr-11,5
We checked in and they held our bags right away when we came back in they took our bags right up and our rooms were newly renovated with huge king beds...even more amazing was the dark curtain to keep out light and the bathroom vanity..we discovered our bathroom door was off track so they send someone right up to fix it. I had gotten two rooms because we went with friends and had the room joined so a moment after we checked in the slid a paper under our friends door and it was information on 9 different web sited where my friend could replace her broken handle on her vintage suitcase. We were very impressed from the in room safes to the coffee set up and the amazing use of space. The only issue was not being told they were putting a hold on my card for 25 dollars on each room which took 4 days to fall off my account but other then that small snafu the entire trip was perfect I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a lovely room and a great location...,7-Apr-11,5
"Imagine a panoramic view of San Francisco from the 36th Floor of this Grand Hyatt hotel. Add a club atmosphere, intimate bar and grill with yummy burgers and refeshing wine; Dining on the same floor includes a separate dining room for breakfast brunch, lunch and full menu dinner. Attentive and polite servers put you at ease. Located near great shopping, this hotel has our vote for return visits. Enjoy!",4-Apr-11,5
"I have stayed in many hotels in San Fran on business trips, this is one of the best, especially for the price. I hate big cities, they are loud! When you are trying to sleep this is especially ANNOYING!! I only stayed one night, but missing at night here were the loud sirens, jack hammers and yelling people I am used to hearing in SF. I forgot my iphone charger, but after a couple beers and some great chowder at the restaurant (didn't have a great food selection) on the 36th floor I realized the phone had an ipod charger attached to the back of the in-room phone! Hopefully they have all of the rooms upgraded soon because I doubt the others had this. The phones even have speakers so you can play your ipod. The beds headboard had reading lights attached. Didn't use the gym but it appears they will get you gym clothes if you need them. FOrget toothpaste? Its provided in the bathroom. There is A LOT of shopping near. Worst part of this hotel was thin walls. I could hear high heels clomping around and my neighbors ironing board being opened and closed.",1-Apr-11,4
"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Easy walk to great restaurants, the cable cars, the best shopping and local sights around the city. You would think that at the prices they charge you would get free wireless - oh well. We had a recently renovated and stylishly decorated room, overlooking Union Square. Our only issue with the room was the bathroom door (sliding door) which did little to offer privacy from the rest of the others in the room. Otherwise, the bed and the pillows were really comfortable and the room was, well roomy. The lounge on the top floor had a great view and the muchie menu was really good.",16-Mar-11,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco on the 5th of March 2011, and I can't praise them enough. The location couldn't be better, as it is very central and close to many local attractions. When I arrived, my room had not been cleaned, but the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, and upgraded me to a bigger room at no extra charge. The room itself was extremely nice and comfortable, the view from the 26th floor was great, and I slept really well in the extra comfy bed. The Club provided me with a lovely breakfast the next morning. I would like to thank all the staff that I was in contact with for being so helpful and friendly, and I would particularly like to thank Mr John Satre from the Concierge Desk for his kindness and all his extra help. My stay at the Hyatt was excellent in every way, and I will definitely choose this hotel again in the future, as well as recommending it to friends. Thank you for everything!",8-Mar-11,5
" We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were in one of the newly renovated rooms, and they were beautiful. Being on a lower floor left us with a mediocre view, but having a renovated room made up for it. Great service in every area of the hotel. Did not try out the restaurant, lounge, or fitness area, but the front desk staff was courteous, as were the gentlemen outside in valet and cab service. Booked through priceline for a great price. No complaints!",6-Mar-11,5
"Hotel rooms are being renovated now. Therefore some of them (already renovated ones) are absolutely great and the old ones are... well, really old (furniture and all interior, bathrooms, conditioning system, etc.) especially when you've seen the others. Location and service are totally great, it's just a huge diffeence that you can get for the same value.",28-Feb-11,3
"We decided to spend a long weekend in San Francisco based on a great rate we found at the Grand Hyatt. The location is amazing! We took BART in from the airport and the hotel was an easy two-block walk from the Powell Station. Itâ€™s right on Union Square, making it close to all of the shopping in that area. Itâ€™s one block from the cable car and just a five minute walk from Chinatown. Itâ€™s a very short cab ride from the restaurants in North Beach or the sights in Fishermanâ€™s Wharf. The sidewalks around the hotel were draped in scaffolding, which was a bit of a drag. They mustâ€™ve been doing some sort of renovations or other work to the exterior. The lobby is a bit dark and drab. Nothing special and certainly not inviting. The front desk agents, while extremely friendly and helpful, were slow. We frequently noticed long lines waiting for service, even with several agents working.But the room was quite comfortable and provided a great place to stay. The hotel is currently undergoing interior renovations. From what we were told by the front desk staff and what we saw, the lower floors have already been renovated. Since we requested a view, we were on an upper floor which had not yet been renovated. So for now, you can choose between a great view or a renovated room, but it appears that you canâ€™t have both. When the elevator stopped on the renovated floors, they appear to have been completely overhauled â€“ new flooring, wall coverings, furnishings, lighting, etc. If the hallway is any indication, the newly renovated rooms must be amazing.Though our room had not yet been renovated, it was still very comfortable. They furniture and some of the fixtures are a bit tired, but Hyattâ€™s Grand Bed provides for a great nightâ€™s sleep. And ultimatelyâ€_ thatâ€™s really all we needed out of the hotel. We had a city view â€“ our room looked right across into the financial district. In fact, we even slept with the curtains open, lulled to sleep by the soft lights of the cityâ€™s skyline. That skyline also provided the perfect backdrop for the lounge on the upper floor. The workout facility was awesome â€“ again, taking advantage of that amazing view. Though it didnâ€™t have showers, or a steam room/sauna/Jacuzzi, it was the most well stocked hotel gym Iâ€™ve ever seen. Every piece of cardio equipment you could imagine, along with weight machines, free weights, benches, exercise balls, TVs, towels, etc. Very easy to get in a complete workout, no matter what your routine.As platinum members, we enjoyed free WiFi in our room. I didnâ€™t notice what the normal charge is, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s exorbitant. The connection was a bit slow, but it worked for what we needed. Had I been trying to work with that connection, it couldâ€™ve been somewhat frustrating. We never ate at the hotel, nor did we park there, so I canâ€™t speak to those aspects. There didnâ€™t appear to be anywhere to get coffee in the lobby. And it was excruciatingly slow and very difficult to get a cab for dinner on a Friday night. Thatâ€™s certainly not the fault of the hotel, but something worth noting if youâ€™re seeking a cab.All things considered, the Grand Hyatt was certainly not the nicest place weâ€™ve ever stayed, but it was comfortable, safe and you canâ€™t beat the location. It was a great base for our long weekend in San Francisco.",25-Feb-11,4
"The Grand Hyatt's newly renovated rooms are really nice, have a very contemporary feel. Really liked the style, feels like a brand new hotel. Location can't be beat. It was raining the whole time we were there but walks to so many things were short so we didn't mind. Had breakfast at the Grandviews restaurant. Really good foot, nice portions, with spectacular views.",24-Feb-11,5
"My sister surprised me with a stay at the Grand Hyatt when she took me to San Francisco for my first time. The front desk agent that helped us, Mylene, did a fabulous job getting us into a fantastic room that we really enjoyed. Beautiful views and extra comfortable beds made our stay really fun! The concierge got us on the preferred waiting list at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner (super convenient!) and we loved falling asleep looking at the lights of the city from our room. The only thing that bothered me was the amount of time I was placed on hold when I had to call the front desk a few times. I work at a resort myself, so I know the importance of answering guest's calls. Also, parking costs a fortune so we ended up using the Macy's lot down the way and there is no pool (for the price paid there should be one) These were only instances where I felt the Grand Hyatt could've improved. I would not let that stop me from staying at this hotel though - no major complaints, try it out!",13-Feb-11,5
"When an out of town guest tells the front desk that they did not sleep well because of certain situations in the room, the response should not be "" wear earplugs"" the staff not only represents the entire hyatt brand but also the city they are in. Grand hyatt San Francisco did a POOR job of representing the hyatt name and the city of San Francisco. Any guest who tells a hotel staff that they have a problem should be addressed "" how can I make your stay more comfortable"" or "" I'm sorry you had a problem let me see what we can do for you"" Not met with a Rude response. I, my co-workers, company, Family and Friends will no longer consider hyatt hotels as a viable choice of stay.",8-Feb-11,1
"I had a meeting planned in San Francisco at the Grand Hyatt in January. It also happened to be my 35th wedding anniversary weekend. So my wife and I had our two sons join us from NYC to celebrate. San Francisco and the hotel were wonderful but our concierge Elizabeth Baca-Pryfogle made our trip one to remember. She recommended a great restaurant based on her personal experience. The next day we came back from a tour of Alcatraz to find a bottle of champagne with a note attached wishing us a happy anniversary and the following day she sent a fruit basket for us to enjoy. Although she was very busy she took the time to treat us like we were family. If you go to San Francisco stay at the Grand Hyatt and go see Elizabeth she is amazing.Virgil, Terri, Nick & Stephen",8-Feb-11,5
"Our impressions with the hotel started before we arrived: super-helpful reservation staff who helped us with all of our questions and requests.We arrived Christmas afternoon with 2 sick children (the long haul from Sydney had taken it's toll), but our room was beautiful (super-comfy beds). Furthermore, one of the lovely staff, who happily took table photos at our Christmas dinner in the restaurant), took in the fact that our oldest child barely ate due to illness and did not charge us for his meal.Every single staff person we came across smiled and said hello. Front Desk & Concierge were fantastic.And the location? Terrific! Wish we were back there now!",6-Feb-11,5
"I stayed one night at the end of January. It was a Monday night so I was easily upgraded to a room with a view of the city. The reception staff was very polite and ultra obliging. The room was small with two double beds. Walking in the room was difficult due to too much furntiure in the room which led to a cramped feeling. There was a large armoire jutting into the room with an old fashioned TV. There was also a place for the mini bar but no mini bar. The two club chairs were too large for the room also. The beds were very comfortable though. The bath towels however were threadbare at best. They were so bad it was funny. As I was checking out my daughter struck up a conversation with a manager who told her the hotel was in the midst of a renovation and only half of the rooms were completed. Obviously not ours.Breakfast at the restaurant on top of the hotel was wonderful. The food on the buffet was fresh and delicious. The real treat was the view. This restaurant and bar at night have 360 degree views of the city. The morning we were there the weather was sunny and clear, so the city was beautiful",4-Feb-11,4
"We recently stayed at this property in late January for 5 nights. The trip was 3 days of business and two days of sightseeing. I can't say enough wonderful things about the entire stay or staff. It started wth the very gracious check in for a room with a wonderful view of the bay and Alcatraz.The room was wonderful, clean, comfortable nicely furnished (and this wasn't one of the brand new renovated rooms) I understand they are renovating the hotel and rooms. However this room was nearly perfect. The highlight for me was breakfast each morning in the Grandviews restaurant on the 36th floor. The breakfast buffet is awesome and the breakfast staff was so friendly each day, even offered me help with directions when they saw me looking at a map at the table.Joanna at the concierge desk is one of the most hospitable and helpful individuals I've run into in the hospitality industry. She offered great selections of restaurants and sights to see and helped arrange tickets for the alcatraz and bus tours.The location of the hotel is perfect for just about anything. I had a short 5 minute walk to my conference hotel each day, my fiance spent her free time walking all over the city. From Union Square to The Embarcodaro, to Westfields Shopping. She felt comfortable the entire time and never felt in danger or worried.We hope to go back to San Francisco when we have more time to visit and we will certainly not consider any other hotel.",3-Feb-11,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for approx. 140 USD/night in a room with two queen beds (corporate rate). Nothing special, but a good deal for San Francisco. Bathroom was okay (US standard). The location cannot be better in my opinion, as you always come across MacyÂ´s on your way to Moscone Center. The room was clean and looked after quite well. The beds are very comfortable with thick mattrasses. Good value.",27-Jan-11,3
"The renovation that's going on with the hotel is fantastic. Rooms are now fresh and very comfortable. With regards to available space in the room it's very spacious (compared to other SF hotels). There is now a blackout blind over the main windows, in place of heavy blinds, and you will easily sleep late with how dark it makes everything. Nicely done Hyatt",26-Jan-11,4
"The hotel is in a great location right in Union Square, but that pretty much summed up all the good things I had to say about it.I have stayed at at least 10 different Grand Hyatts around the world, without counting the Park Hyatt stays, so it's safe to say that I know what the Grand Hyatt standards should be.As a Hyatt GPP Diamond member, I have always been guaranteed room upgrade to the next room category with welcome fruit baskets and wine and a personal note from the GM of the hotel already in the room before I check in almost every time I visit a Hyatt property. I might have been spoiled, but when I do spend so much time and money in their hotels I definitely expect more than average service and treatment. I wasn't quite impressed with the room assignment at check-in already. I was assigned a very small room that is not on the Club floor at first and didn't even get Club Lounge access. Front desk staff didn't seem to have any clue about my membership status until I inquired about it. I would expect that they should have been able to pull out this information from their system.Rooms are old and definitely require remodeling which I understand is underway. I have taken a look at both the renovated and non-renovated rooms and eventually picked the old room for the better view as the renovated room looked out to the back of the adjacent building.Room amenities were next to nonexistent. I had to call housekeeping to request for very basic amenities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, slippers and bathrobes, which are normally complimentary in a Grand Hyatt elsewhere.Housekeeping was sloppy. The ironing board was left in the bathroom throughout the entire duration of our stay after we used it on the first day. The iron was left next to the sink in the bathroom and was not put away after our use. The half-empty takeout coffee from the Club Lounge was left on the top of the cabinet in my room for days until I disposed it myself.One day I left the ""Private"" sign on the door before I headed out and when I came back to the room that evening my room was cleaned up nonetheless. If I requested for privacy, I would expect the housekeeping staff to first confirm with me whether the sign was left there intentionally before breaking into my room while I wasn't there.The walls were paper thin. I could hear conversations going on in my neighbours' rooms and every morning I was woken up at 6am when the guests next door got up.I stayed at the St Regis during my last visit to SF a few months ago and I didn't have any of the problems I mentioned above, granted I'm also Platinum SPG member. Most importantly, I felt that I was treated like a valued guest while I was staying at the St Regis which is what every hotel should strive to achieve.My overall experience at Grand Hyatt SF was more like that of a no frills hotel, except I paid a lot more than what I would have had to pay for Motel 6. The top management of this hotel seems to have little appreciation of what managing a Grand Hyatt property should mean to the guests. Understand the hotel is undergoing a major upgrade on the hardware but I would suggest management also consider improving on their software so that the service and overall experience would be on par with the rest of the Grand Hyatt properties.",23-Jan-11,2
"I took my daughter and her four friends to San Francisco for her 18th birthday. For the girls, we booked an executive suite, which was large (2 doubles and a queen sofa bed + two bathrooms) on the 20th floor with an unbelievable view. We had dinner in the Grandview Restaurant. The food was good, not exception, but the waiters were top notch. Some of us had steak, which was cooked to perfection. Needless to say, the view from the restaurant was spectacular. My daughter wasn't feeling well, so they made her chicken soup - very thoughtful.All rooms were very clean. The staff were all friendly and courteous. Everyone seemed to go out of their way to make sure our stay was wonderful. They are renovating some of the downstairs of the hotel, but it had no impact on us at all.We have stayed here a few times and have always had a wonderful time. They now really have my loyalty after handling my daughter's party so well, especially while she wasn't feeling the best. The following day we had a color consultation with Donna Fujii. The girls took their color fans with them shopping for the rest of the trip. It was a wonderful weekend to remember!",23-Jan-11,5
"First time at the hotel and will stay here in future on visits to San Francisco. We have stayed in some others in the past, but this is by fart he best for location, service and comfort. The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the bay views from the room were just amazing and allowed us to enjoy the New Year fireworks. The overall service from the staff was very good and the check in was quick and easy, just what you need after travelling for 14 / 15 hours. Really loved the hotel and love the city, its the best place in the world! Thanks",18-Jan-11,5
Perfect location for first timers to SF. Loved the shopping nearby and the trams that were so close.The room was more then adequate in size with 2 double beds and good size bathroom facilities. The Wifi was a little expensive. But overall very enjoyable..,11-Jan-11,4
"Its a good Hyatt with all that entails. Excellent serice and a great loaction in San Fran. Rooms are maybe getting a little dated and I never undertand why the bathtubs are so small in the States but hey ho. I stay in this Hotel every year for a few days before heading onwards. Great connections for the airport, great shopping location, away from the tourist tat of Fishermans Wharf and plenty of good restraunts nearby.",9-Jan-11,4
"I had an amazing stay at Grand Hyatt San Francisco earlier this week. After a busy week at work I just wanted to get a way and relax and enjoy the city. I went to the hotel with my dog and I had a fabulous time. Everything about the hotel was perfect from the time I arrived at the front drive until I checked out of the hotel. Customer service at this hotel is exceptional. Mylene and Ron at the front desk are awesome. They went out of their way to make sure my pet and I had a perfect stay. My dog was so excited when she entered the room, there were doggie treats and doggie bowls and very nice comfortable bed for her. Housekeeping staff did a fantastic job taking care of the room and my stay was perfect. I will make sure to tell all my friends Grand Hyatt San Francisco.",6-Jan-11,5
"San Francisco was our first stop in our four-weeks U.S. vacation for husband, I and our two kids. We chose Grand Hyatt and really love this hotel. We stayed here two years ago and this time we were given their newly renovated rooms. They are nicely done, with flat screen tv, functional workdesk and extremely comfortable and spacious twin beds. Love the location. Easy access to all the main shops - Macys, Neimann Marcus, Bloomingdales and many more. The Grand Club lounge at this hotel has a small but nice buffet and evening spreads. Worth paying the difference, especially if you are travelling with two kids. Reception staff, housekeeping and especially the doormen were very friendly and extremely helpful.",29-Dec-10,5
Above average rooms with great views. Bathrooms need work but if you are going away on businsess this is my favorite hotel in the city so far. Everything you need is right around the corner and service is great.,19-Dec-10,4
"This was the second time in 2 yrs that we stayed here. It is located right off Union Square so one can walk to SFMOMA, Westfield Mall & all the galleries & upscale shopping in and around Union Square. We booked room early because it was Thanksgiving week. The rate was lower than at the nearby Hilton & smaller, lower quality hotels surrounding Union Sq & it included very good buffet or cooked to order breakfast on the 36 floor with a great view of SF, Golden Gate, etc. Staff were all personable, knowledgeable and efficient. There is a full-time concierge to answer your questions rather than just front desk clerks. Room had all the amenities except they have not put in flat screen TV yet. There was some exterior construction around the front entrance but there was no disruption or noise. We still don't understand why inexpensive hotels provide free WiFi &/or ethernet, but more expensive chains charge >$10/day for internet connection.",13-Dec-10,5
"My original reservation rate at my conference rate was not ""captured"" by the hotel computer, they called it a computer glitch but they did have my check in and out dates. I did have my confirmation so they reluctantly agreed to honor that price. They also charged me for an extra night because again there was a computer ""Glitch"" and they did not receive my check in change date that I did have a confirmation for. Again they reluctantly removed the extra charge. That was settled the first night I was there, or so I thought. The higher rate and exra night stayed on my credit card for the 4 days I was there and I had to go over all of the hassles when I checked out and they still billed me for everything they were supposed to remove. You must review all of the charges before you leave!! And always have your confirmation! Otherwise the hotel is located in a great spot for shopping and public transportation. The conference facility was great, no problems there and the food was excellent! Don't suggest the hotel restaurant though, overpriced average tasting food.",12-Dec-10,3
"We are frequent visitors here. We went down to shop for Christmas on 12/3. Building is being refurnished to update rooms. Hope they do a good job for reasons posted on this board. Noise was not a problem. Cannot beat the location for shopping purposes. After Fairmont, Carnelian Room, and Hilton closed their top floor restaurants/bars, the Grand Hyatt is one of the few left with Mark Hopkins. BUT we heard a rumor they want to move the restaurant to ground level. We had very good staff services this trip. Agree with comments that this has always been geared as a business hotel. Wish they would have coffee out in the morning instead of forcing everyone across the street to Starbucks.",6-Dec-10,4
"I am a loyal Hyatt fan and had read recent reviews so knew this would not be a great stay this time but I was so disappointed.We arrived in a taxi and had quite a bit of luggage.There was no one to help us.So we dragged our luggage into the front foyer.Front desk were abrupt, unfriendly and not helpful.Rooms were OKClub staff were great! The hotel is in a great position but I doubt I will stay here again.",29-Nov-10,3
"If you want to be close to Union Square this is perfect! However, the towels were thin and scratchy; even on higher level floors street noise was quite apparent. Noisy air condictioning system and worse yet- the room CREAKED all night in a bad rain storm! The bed linens were VERY clean and comfortable. This facility is in need of a remodel which they have started. We were not made aware of the remodel until check-in as well as the subsequent noise. Requests for adjoining rooms and a refrigerator were not accomodated. The highlight of the hotel is the 36th floor bar! The food was quite good, staff was very attentive and pleasant- wonderful views! Overall, hotel staff were not very warm and welcoming. Concierge staff were very helpful. Wiould I recommend? possibly....",23-Nov-10,3
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco to enjoy a nice ""4 Star"" hotel. What we got was lucky to be even a 3 Star experience that made a Motel 6 so much more appealing!First off, the hotel rooms are small and, as many have said, very outdated. This we could understand, San Francisco has limited space and obviously they can't expand outwards. So it was already expected for the size.BUT... what wasn't expected was the quality of the building and bed. We never thought we'd say this, but can't they afford to buy a new mattress? At an average of $200 a night for a room, you'd figure on sleeping on a comfortable mattress and not something that looks like it's been there since they opened the hotel 40 years ago. The king-size mattress had giant pits (I'd like to say dips, but they were way too deep) on both sides of the bed where people lay each evening. Only by placing one of the extra pillows into each crevice could the bed be made level to sleep on. This was TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a hotel of this quality!! Come on, the mattress could have been replaced for the cost of a single night's stay. Not worthy of a so-called ""4 Star"" hotel.And the building... sure, it's a high-rise 36 story building and is bound to sway in the wind. But we were kept awake by the constant creeking, snapping and popping sounds that it made as it swayed in the breeze. We were waiting for the final loud pop before it collapsed on us. Other guests in the bar also complained of the same loud noises. Perhaps a building inspector should take a look before something bad happens?Then there was the refrigerator and mini-bar. If you're going to stay in the room expecting to use the refrigerator, think again. It was packed top to bottom with beer, soda and wines that if moved at all, you're IMMEDIATELY charged for. That's one high tech refrigerator.. but they can't even put in a flat screen tv? We called the front desk and they were very nice and said to go ahead and remove bottles to make the room we needed and they'd remove them off our bill. They did, no problem (at least not yet, we have not seen our credit card statement). The mini-bar lady came by before checkout to review the contents and noticed one bottle missing in the door of the refrigerator. We figured it was the only place they left for someone to put a drink, but apparently it wasn't fully stocked and was missing a bottle of wine. Good thing we found out, it was also removed from our bill. Note to those wanting a drink.. it's $9.00 for a can of beer. The shelves on the dresser/TV unit were also dedicated to fast grab snacks, so don't expect to use it for storing your clothes. They had mouse-trap like devices with candy bars in them. We'd hate to see the prices for those!!Everyone from the staff was very nice, unlike some comments we read on here. Staff made it feel like a 4-5 Star hotel, but the room was maybe a 2 Star, bar was okay and fitness gym was up to date.Now for parking... we didn't pay the $50+ parking fee for the hotel parking. Instead, we parked across the street at the Sutter-Stockton garage and paid a fraction the price the hotel wanted to charge. We arrived around 1 p.m. on Saturday and left at noon on Sunday. Paid only $28 parking. We highly recommend the Sutter-Stockton public parking garage. It's just a short walk and is diagonally across from the hotel.",22-Nov-10,3
"The Grand Hyatt San Francisco would be a fantastic hotel in a lot of other cities in the world. Unfortunately, it's in San Francisco.I travel frequently to San Francisco, and have stayed frequently at other hotels; however, needing a one-night stay I decided to try out the Grand Hyatt. I should admit that there was nothing particularly wrong with my stay -- I had a perfectly adequate room on a high floor, with a nice view.However, as a Hyatt Diamond, I wasn't particularly impressed with the room -- based on the room map, it appears to have been one of the smallest in the hotel, and though high up, it wasn't on the same floor as the Grand Club. Furnishings were high quality, but a bit tired, with a worn counter in the bath. The bed was comfortable, and the room was very quiet. I didn't get a chance to check out the Grand Club, but it's not on the top floor of the hotel, which costs it a few points in my book. The cocktail lounge, which is on the top floor, has a nice northerly view of Coit Tower and the Transamerica, but it's kind of tight, and noisy, and the music from the private event next door kept intruding. Staff everywhere was pleasant, but not exceptional.All in all, I'd be perfectly happy with this property if there weren't so many other good options in the area. However, the Hyatt Regency is nicer for Hyatt loyalists, and the Westin is a better hotel in Union Square if you're a Starwood elite. And at the northeast corner of Union Square, it's a bit of a hike to transit compared to other nearby properties. So at the end of the day -- stay here if you get a deal, and you'll be perfectly happy, but don't pay a premium for the Grand Hyatt name.",16-Nov-10,3
"We arrived at the hotel and found it surrounded by scaffolding but it did not put us off at all. We had booked a Bay View room but when we arrived the reception staff suggested that we have a City view room. We took their advice which was lucky really as the Bay was obscured for most of our stay by fog/low cloud. The city view from the 22nd floor was magnificent, especially at night.The room and hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff were very courteous, very helpful and knowledgeable.The hotel was very quiet where ever you went which was great so it was very easy to get a good nights sleep.We flew with Virgin and got two free nights which meant the hotel was very good value for money, if not cheap. However, if you factor in the location and quality of the hotel we were pleased overall.My only gripe was that I thought the bathroom should have been larger but that's me just being picky.I've kept the best until last. On the top floor of the hotel you'll find the restaurant and bar. The views are to die for.I would highly recommend this hotel.",14-Nov-10,4
"S Fco has three Hyatt hotels. The Grand Hyatt is the oldest I believe and it shows.Everything - rooms, facilities is just adequate. Location is great, just a step from Union Square, a couple of blocks to Market St to the nearest BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport) station. The no.30 bus takes you to Fishermans Wharf/Ghirardelli - as senior it cost me all of 75 cts.Cons: Breakfast buffet is overpriced (w/tips/ tax close to $30) and below standards of other Hyatt hotels I've stayed in. Go one block towards Chinatown and you'll find the Cafe de la Presse - great.Hotel has no pool, hot tub etc. There is no food other than breakfast, not even a sandwich but rooms have a bar fridge where you can keep some stuff if you take the cans etc out..S Fco is not great on corner shops, the nearest 7/11 is a couple of blocks away. Don't try to make tea with the coffeee maker- it will taste nothing like, I missed the plain kettle we have in any Australian hotel.Rates in Nov.2010 about US 200 (1-2 people)Internet - wired & wireless will cost you $10/day - cross street to Starbucks and you can log in for free.Finally, staff is very nice, friendly and helpful.",13-Nov-10,3
"Wow-- not what I expected from a Hyatt. The rooms are way tacky/80s decor. Rooms are small, and while the views are nice, the windows are cramped due to the non-functional balconies blocking part of your view. This is definitely NOT how hotels are built today.There was a strange odor in our room as well as in the lobby. Like incense. I think they were covering up for something else. Our room also smelled like a smoker's room at times.Service was fine-- friendly and nice. $10/day for wi-fi? really?Was very disappointed b/c I know there are lots of better places to stay for the same price in town. Oh well.",13-Nov-10,1
"This will be our 4th stay this year (another scheduled) at the Grand Hyatt in Union Square, and wanted to let all the ""TA viewers"" know that this hotel is still pleasant and comfortable enough for us to continue to patronize ... we've stayed at many other SF hotels, including the Hyatt Regency, the Meridian, the Hiltons, etc... The Grand Hyatt is not THE BEST, but does the job = convenient, comfortable, service. There are some good and some sorta bad ... please read on:The Goods: Service. During one stay, I requested a high floor, got it, and the views were very nice. We wanted a non-connecting room, and requested a change ... and Sebastian/Night Manager was terrific in helping move us to a different room, even upgrading us. Thank you Sebastian! The new view cleared all the surrounding buildings, and had a nice Northern view of SF Bay & Coit Tower. Comfort: The room was comfortable, as expected ... clean, with a very comfortable bed, and very quiet. Convenient: Union Square shopping and Chinatown, along with all sorts of transportation options were right outside the hotel. The 'bads': The hotel is clearly primarily a business/convention hotel. If you're looking for an intimate, warm, elegant, trendy or boutique/small hotel ... forget it! The staff was however, generally nice, and greeted us always. Make no mistake though ... this is the classic large, downtown business hotel (approx 36 floors), with a 'ga-jillion' rooms along with a semi-large gym/fitness center (no pool), as well as ballrooms/conference rooms, etc.. The rooms do need some updating: flat-screen TV needed, desk/table worn, aging tub, worn cabinets. It sounds worse than reality, so don't let this deter you (as many of the areas hotels have similar issues), but it's time for some updating.Overall: We didn't spend huge amounts of time in the room. We wanted to enjoy SF and surrounding areas. So, if all you need is a fairly comfortable, convenient hotel with enough amenities to make the stay enjoyable, you should be fine here. Get past the size, semi-warm staff, and basic-decorated rooms, you'll be fine. We recommend it for general use, but not necessarily for a romantic stay.

"I am ALL about DEALS, COUPONS, etc. I try not to pay full price for just about anything. And this is my favorite deal that I take advantage of the most often! We live in Sacramento, so we go to San Francisco very often. Whether it's a weekend trip with just my husband and I, or just about anytime our family and friends come to visit-- we stay a night or two in San Fran. This is the BEST deal. Just ""name your own price"" on Priceline for Union Square in San Francisco. Keep it at the HIGHEST amount of stars. We've gotten weeknights for $80, weekends for $90-100. Their parking is way overpriced. If you're traveling with a handicap person (my mom is) parking is free! If not, park at a local garage for better pricing. The rooms are great, the service is great (ask the concierge in the lobby for advice and reservations!) It's walking distance from everything in Union Square. We LOVE it!!!! Ask for a room with a view!",4-Nov-10,4

"We stayed in Grand Hyatt with my family in October 2010.Next to Union Square, the hotel is currently renovated, but this made no difference to our stay. Rooms are a bit outdated and need the renovation, but the hotel staff is in excellent location, staff are simply wonderful and this was one of the most value for money hotels I have stayed.Nothing negative to talk about, I would certainly stay there again and again and again (especially following renovations).",20-Oct-10,5
"Jackhammers begin at 9 am, and the front desk treats us like we're unreasonable to want to sleep in on our vacation. Then a strange man leaps onto our balcony and begins painting it at 11 am with NO WARNING! We were supposed to stay a week and we're checking out today!",18-Oct-10,1
"We have experienced the best of hospitality at Grand Hyatt and we wish all of you planning a visit to this hotel experience it too. I was surprised as well when I had reviews of this hotel earlier as they were not very positive, but absolutely it is an excellent place to be in. 1. proximity to the best shopping and restaurants.2. Wonderfully concierge. Very helpful and informative.3. Excellent Regency club lounge on 33 floor.4. Well connected to local sights.",15-Oct-10,5
"This hotel is well located, but very tired. My room was very warn--almost everything was chipped, scuffed, or scratched. The bath products (maybe standard at hyatt in the US? Not in Asia/Australia) smelled disgusting, like artificial melon bubble gum. The location is very handy--but there are lots of hotels (at least 30) nearby, so this isn't such a selling point. The views are very nice, and the bones of the building are cool enough. I think this hotel could be amazingly renovated. I can easily imagine it becoming as hip as the Standard in New York. Even if it didn't take a hip turn, it could be brought up to speed with other better hyatts...probably with so many amazing hotels in SF, there just isn't demand for another top tier hotel in the current economy. Until it is renovated, I'll be sleeping (and eating) elsewhere when I visit San Francisco.",12-Oct-10,3
"Have been guest at the Grand Hyatt for a couple of days in early May. The rooms in the upper follors are very large with a great view over Union Square and the skyline of Sand Francisco, which I really liked. But the hotel overall has not been too exciting and they also have forgotten about crediting me the Hyatt points, which I have earned there. As a private guest I would rather stay at another hotel around Union square for a fraction of the price.",10-Oct-10,3
We stayed one night at this hotel. It was in an excellent location for us to walk to so many different sites throughout the city. The room was well equiped with all the basics. The bed was very comfortable. The staff was very nice and helpful. Great views of the city from the restaurant at the top too.,9-Oct-10,4
My husband and I spent a few days here is September 2007. The hotel is nice and modern and the location is perfect. We walked everywhere! The staff is friendly and we would definitely stay here again.,8-Oct-10,5
"Stayed here for 4 nights in September 2010. The location, just off Union Square, is excellent with Market Street just a few minutes away for access to the MUNI and BART transport systems. For shopaholics, loads of fine shops around. Plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and Chinatown is barely a 5 minute walk away. The rooms were surprisingly large, with a fine, large comfortable bed. The standard of cleanliness and housekeeping was also good. We heard no street noise on the 26th floor, excepting occasional emergency vehicle sirens. The only negative comment I have of the hotel as a whole is that we felt the rooms themselves could do with a makeover â€“ seemed a bit on the tired and dowdy side. I was especially surprised to see an old fashioned CRT TV â€“ weâ€™re more used to LCD TVs these days. We enjoyed the very excellent bar on the top floor (36th floor) where the views were quite stunning. A good drinks menu, but we never had a full meal in the restaurant, preferring to eat out although we did enjoy a pizza on our first evening after an 11 hour flight as we were tired but not especially hungry; it was fine. Bar prices were not too expensive considering the status of the hotel and the location, so we used it quite a lot. We always found the staff to be very helpful and attentive. In all, an excellent stay and would definitely stay again.",8-Oct-10,4
"The service at this hotel is performed graciously and precisely. The reservation staff went out of their way to make sure we were registered for their points program as they currently had a special promotion going on. All other personnel was firendly, gracious and expedient. The room was tastefully done,beds very combortable,temperature easily adjusted. The only comment might be that the hotel needs to upgrade to flat screen tvs in the rooms. Currently the outside facade is being rennovated and I believe there are plans to rennovate on parts of the inside.. Location is very cental on Union Square and very easy to start walking trips around San Francisco. Disliked the room tvs. Enjoyed the top floor dining room particularly the continental breakfast buffet and great view.",7-Oct-10,5
"Location best thing about this hotel as it's right next to Union Square. Scaffolding up when we went but didn't affect our stay. Room fine. Bar and restaurant good. Concierge service good. If you can get good rate which we did then it's perfectly good enough, just don't expect to be wowed. Fine for city break.",7-Oct-10,4
"Great view of bay, we loved upgrading to a club pass!",5-Oct-10,4
"Ideally suited as a base to discover the city. Close to the shops, tour buses and car hire. The walk down to Fisherman's Wharf is a bit of a trek but well worth the effort as you walk through Chinatown and beyond. Breakfast was a little expensive but the service and the views were excellent. For a cheaper option - hop across the road to Starbucks, which has free wi-fi for the teenagers! Would definitely stay here again - the Bay View room was worth the upgrade.",26-Sep-10,4
"Despite the expensive breakfast and internet access, this hotel is perfect: great location, since it is near of many interesting places; amazing views, mainly from the restaurant on 36th floor; and friendly staff.",21-Sep-10,5
"This hotel is in a good location. Walking distance to union square, shopping, BART, restaurants etc. Felt very safe to walk around. Staff was very friendly. Check in was easy, no line and it was 4pm. We traveled with friends and asked to be put on the same floor. The hotel didn't have two rooms ready on the same floor. The bell desk took our luggage for storage and the front desk clerk told us it would be an hour. No problem, we went to get coffee, convenient location right across the street. 15 minutes later we received a phone call that our rooms were ready. The doorman are very helpful with directions, maps, recommendations and putting you in a taxi without waiting very long in the car. What really impressed me with the customer service was when we took a town car to the airport. At check in we realized that we left our laptop in the car. I called the hotel and told them what happened and was told they would check on it. 5 minutes later I was told the driver was on his way back to the airport to drop it off.",19-Sep-10,5
"For staying in San Fran, you can't beat the location. It is close to everything: restaurants, bars, transportation, shopping, etc. This is an older hotel and the rooms definitely show the wear and tear. We got a good discount using the Costco rate; it would not have been worth it at all without the discount. BEWARE OF VALET PARKING: over $60 per night. Take the train to park elsewhere. The staff is friendly and mostly attentive. The rooms are laid out well, the bathroom had all the necessities and everything is clean. If you have stayed at a new Grand Hyatt recently, do not expect the same facility here...you could probably find a nicer room cheaper if you searched around at the boutique hotels. All in all, it was a good experience.",16-Sep-10,3
"The Grand Hyatt is a large luxury hotel just off Union Square. Most of the San Francisco tourist sights are quickly reachable by buses or cable cars passing near the hotel. The Powell street BART station is just a few blocks away and provides an inexpensive way to reach the San Francisco International airport. Rooms are spacious and clean, and have all the luxuries you would expect from this class of hotel, but the TV in our room was a 25 inch tube, a vanishing beast. Our 8th floor room suffered from street noise, so ask for a higher floor if you need a quiet atmosphere. Our room had pay-for-use wired and wireless Internet, but the wireless signal was weak. The lobby space is pretty small and not the usual atrium like in the other San Francisco Hyatt on the Embarcadero. Grandviews lounge and restaurant on the 36th floor has a spectacular view of San Francisco Bay and reasonable prices given the location and class of hotel.",16-Sep-10,4
"I had a six night stay wrapped around the Labor Day weekend and was pleasantly surprised with the Grand Hyatt. This was my first visit to San Francisco and choosing a hotel took some time and research. The location is terrific with easy access to all public transportation.(Get the muni pass; it is a tremendous bargain).The lobby was on the small side, but so what? It is very attractive and offers all the services you expect in a good hotel.Prompt, courteous staff with special mention going to the concierge desk. I reserved a bay-view, non-smoking room with a king-sized bed. I ended up in a room on the 26th floor that appeared to have undergone a fairly recent remodel. Extremely clean and very nicely furnished with a bed that was heaven on earth. If I have any ""complaints"", they are minor. The walls were a tad thin(heard the neighbors a few times), the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't have a wall switch that I could find(got pretty steamy after a hot shower) and calling this a bay-view room was true but it would be better to call it a bay and city view room. Yes, I could see the bay but the majority of the view was of other buildings. The view was beautiful(especially at night) and I was not at all unhappy about it, but labeling it a bay-view room created expectations of an unobstructed view of the bay. In addition to the concierge staff, here are some more special mentions for this hotel:1) Iron and ironing board(very handy!!)2) Free daily newspaper3) Lots of upscale shopping nearby4) Wide variety(price and menu offerings) of restaurants nearby5) Theater district is also nearby6) Walgreens right around the corner for those items you forgot to pack7) Shuttle service to/from SFO a bargain at $16.008) Alarm clock on the night table as a back up for my cell phone alarm(don't laugh)9)Etc.................",13-Sep-10,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 nights. The hotel is in a great location - you're about 3 minutes away from Market Street, where you can hop on the MUNI and BART to pretty much anywhere in the city. It's right across from Union Sq and next door to Chinatown and the Cable Car lines. Plenty of eating and shopping options in the area as well. We booked the hotel through a priceline bid (about $100/night cheaper than the regular rates), but the staff person that checked us in (I think his name was Ryan) was friendly and welcoming nonetheless. The room looks worn out though - the tv, the carpet, the furniture all look like they need to be replaced soon. The bathroom also looks worn. But at least the room itself was clean (no bugs!) and the bed was very comfortable. I would probably stay here again just for its location but only if I could a discounted rate again - otherwise, there are probably better options out there.",8-Sep-10,4
"This is a lovely hotel and would receive my recommendation to friends and family were it not for the bed bug bites my husband received staying there. On the second day of our stay, my husband noticed red welts on his arm. We reported the bites to the hotel staff and were moved to a new room. My husband spoke with a manager and maintenance man who inspected our old room. They claimed no evidence of a problem. I suppose my husband's bites weren't weighed as evidence. As a precaution against bringing pests home, we disposed of all the luggage and clothes we had brought into the room. I hope the hotel takes our report seriously and treats the room, but with the plethora of hotels available in San Francisco I would recommend staying elsewhere.",3-Sep-10,2
Rooms were dreary and dirty. Bathrooms definitely need updating. Musak in elevators is the most annoying I have heard in a long time. Staff were not friendly nor were they helpful. Definitely should not have a 4 star rating. Very over priced.,25-Aug-10,1
"The location of the Grand Hyatt is very convenient, and the views from the bar & restaurant on top are great. Our bay-view room was smaller than the one we'd had at the St. Francis last summer, and our view was not quite as good (although some bay-view rooms would have truly fantastic views). Our room faced toward the financial district (which was actually rather attractive at night), with some views of the bay at the sides.  The few things that brought the hotel down a notch for me may not matter to others. The lobby was virtually non-existent, with nothing there but the check-in desk & concierge. No sundry shop, no gathering place, etc. I missed the feel and amenities of the St. Francis's lobby. The buffet breakfast, while in a room with a great view, was disappointing and sub-par (particularly the muffins and croissants). It's been a while since I've had croissants that bad. Aside from these things, I would have given the hotel 4 stars.",25-Aug-10,3
"This hotel was great. It is very conveniently located. The lobby is so beautiful and the view from the rooms is awesome. Book a room with the regency club-the evening snacks and breakfast are a great deal and quite good. The fitness center is not great, but overall it is a nice place. The parking price is ridiculous, however ($50/day)",23-Aug-10,5
"I stayed in the Grand Hyatt for a full week during August 2010 with some friends. While San Francisco weather was seasonably cooler than usual by about ten degrees, the staff at the Hyatt was warm and friendly (pardon the pun)! It was everyone's first time in the city and every morning when we went downstairs to begin our adventures, we would stop and ask the concierge for advice. Every day they were pleasant and incredibly helpful providing maps, public transportation information, ferry information, and even helped us plan a day trip to Muir Woods. Additionally, they were assisted in getting a car service to take my friends and I back to the airport for our VERY early flight home. They called to confirm the night before and called in the morning when the car had arrived. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff!!! The only negative would be the somewhat dated room furniture, but very clean and neat!",19-Aug-10,5
"The location is perfect at Union Square, walking distance to the starting line of the race. Great restaurants everywhere, metro station to the airport a couple of blocks away. Check-in was like being interrogated by the KGB; my room had been booked under my friend's name and when the reservation had been made the hotel said all I had to do was change it to my name and credit card when I got there. My friend had even called the front desk that day to follow up and was told no problem everything would be taken care of when I got there. Then I got there and the story changed. At first the manager said ""Oh we don't do that anymore"" and told me I couldn't have the room as if I'm just going to say ""OK"", turn around, go back to the airport and fly 3,000 miles back home. I just kept standing there while he fussed and fretted around and I called my friend and asked her to call the manager and he finally relented and let me check in. The room was small which was ok because I don't take up much space but the first night (a weeknight) there was noise from the street like construction going on. My only real complaints were charging for Wi-Fi (a Marriott thing) and lack of electrical outlets--one in the bathroom and one under the little desk that I had to get down on my hands and knees to access. Laptop, ipod, cellphone, Bluetooth=4 outlets. The concierge was wonderful in getting me a 1-day car rental and had excellent written directions for getting out of the city. If you are driving in don't park in the hotel garage--drive around the hotel for a couple of blocks and shop around--I saw one garage that charged half of what Hyatt does.",14-Aug-10,4
"I made my first trip to San Franscisco with my husband over the 4th of July weekend. The city is absolutely beautiful and there is so much to see and do there. The Grand Hyatt at Union Square is perfectly located. We were in the middle of it all: shopping, restaurants, and walking distance to some key attractions. We stayed on the club level which offered some great views. Although the hotel is due for renovations it was still nice and clean. It was obvious that although they haven't updated in a while they have maintained it fairly well. The club level lounge is a bit small but the service was good. The room and bathroom were a bit small and the bathrooms do not have separate showers. We would definitely stay there again, especially since renovations are under way.",10-Aug-10,4
"We stayed for 5 nights at this hotel in mid-July 2010, and found the service and location to be exemplary. Front desk was incredibly helpful in helping us get delayed luggage from United (never trust United's SFO baggage dept). All requests for additional towels, pillows, were filled promptly. Location is terrific--2 minutes from the Chinatown arch entryway; around the corner from Union Square (with Macy's, etc.). Many mid-priced restaurants within 1-2 blocks (try Lefty O'Douls at 333 Geary st, diagonally across Union Square; they have full meals (cafeteria style) for $11 (!). Less than 15 minute walk to many major museums; easy access to BART and to Cable cars. Also, they offer 2 prices for parking--if you drive 1/2 block, they have a deal with a garage that offers 24-hour parking for $33; you can come and go (no extra charges for taking the car out and then returning/ it's all valet at the garage; we tipped $2 each time/ very quick). More expensive garage diagonally across the street but we're talking 25 yards v. 50 yards. Believe it or not, the $33 is actually a low rate for this area. The room was very comfortable; a bit on the small side (seems typical for SF); beds very comfortable. Top floor restaurant has great views and a very good buffet breakfast (not cheap, but nothing is). If you use the AAA rate, you get 2 breakfasts included.",10-Aug-10,5
"The hotel design is great, sort of compact although it has amazing views from the top floor, where there is a bar, restaurant and meeting rooms. The manager, David, is a classy guy who takes pride in this property. He has an awesome golden retriever, Bailey.Shortcomings - a little noisy early in the morning - when dumpsters in the area are emptied. The sliding doors on the rooms could have better sound-proofing. Also, the windows needed cleaning. Strengths - location, ease of getting in and out, and to meeting rooms below, comfort of rooms, cleanliness of rooms, staff, spectacular views from the top.They staff was very friendly and helpful. They will be undergoing a huge renovation, and I look forward to visiting it again.",8-Aug-10,4
"Great location, no problem with the service, speedy check in and never had to wait long for an elevator! Concierge was helpful on getting us Hop on Hop off tickets and also for telling us to get on the trolley at Saks instead of waiting 2.5 hours at the bottom of Powell St. BUT REALLY FOR A DOWNTOWN HOTEL OF THIS QUALITY HAVING OLD TVS AND CHARGING FOR INTERNET??? It seems the more expensive the hotel the more expensive the internet. Get flat screens and include the internet in the room rate.",5-Aug-10,4
"The hotel needs a serious refresh. I was there for one night and I specifically asked for a non smoking room, I got a room that still had smels of smoke.The curtains had holes (probably from cigarettes burns) and there were stains on the lampshade. Not that I'm partciularily looking at this but it is not what I expect from a hotel of this category.",5-Aug-10,3
"I know the economy is down, but the dey word here is wait. Wait to check in, wait for requests and when they say ""we will get that right away"" really means they will not respond. I had a request and they appropriately said ""right away,"" one hour later nothing. I finally called back and there was no follow up. For these prices you would be better off in a full service hotel that offers just that full service.",4-Aug-10,2
"Recommended by our travel agent who got us a very good price. We were very impressed with the size of the rooms (we had interconnecting rooms at a corner), the comfort of the beds and the overall arrangement. We did not use the facilities of the hotel very much, but the location was very good for getting anywhere in the city, especially the buses, cable cars and trolley buses. We used a cable car to get to the Alcatraz Cruises Pier and including the walk it took less than 30 minutes.",2-Aug-10,5
"I stayed here with my family for four nights as part of a tour of the US. After a somewhat belated access to our room, at the 24th floor, we could enjoy the view of the Eastern part of downtown SF and the bay - just like we had requested.The room had an ok size, good beds - and a television from the last century... We did not watch anything else than a couple of weather forecasts, but a flat screen could save some space!The service of the hotel was, apart from the check-in, was excellent. However, in this class and price range, one could expect services as WiFi to be free. The $10 Ã¥lus charge per day seems both 'cheap' and out of date.The location at the NE corner of Union Sq is absolutely fantastic.The next time we go to SF, and we will!, our hotel research will have to come up with an absolute stunner to top this one.",1-Aug-10,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 nights and it was great. Typical Hyatt - nice service, check-in was friendly & quick, concierge was friendly and knowledgable about the area, and rooms were clean. It's a downtown Hyatt, so there is no parking (be prepared for the $45 overnight parking fee), and the lobby is crowded all day - but the location is in the heart of San Fran - 2 blocks from Chinatown - 1 block from Union Square - tons of restaurants and bars around. The top floor bar and restaurant offers one of the best views of the city day or night. If you're looking for a ""boutique"" or B&B type hotel expereince, don't stay here. Otherwise - this makes a great home base for San Fran exploring.",27-Jul-10,5
"We stayed 2 days, driving to Napa and back on day 2. We wished we had stayed 2 nights in Bodega Bay instead. That was wonderful for about the same money.",24-Jul-10,3
"This is the 3rd time I have stayed at this hotel and each time I have been happy. The rooms are clean and large for the city. The staff friendly and helpful. I love the location, right on Union Square and close to everything! Parking is expensive though there is a public parking lot close by that might be less expensive.",24-Jul-10,4
"Stayed for 3 nights of our family vacation with our 3 children (17+ years old.) Got the AAA rate with breakfast included and used Hyatt dollars we bought at Costo for an extra 20% off so the price was great for two adjoining rooms. Enjoyed the buffet breakfast on the top floor with a great view. Chinatown was around the corner as were the shops of Union Square. Parking was pricey, but no more so than the other parking lots we checked. Room was clean and quiet, beds were cushy and big enough for my daughters to share comfortably. All in all, a perfect place to land after a day of sightseeing.",13-Jul-10,5
"We stayed here while my husband was at a conference and we couldn't have been happier with the location and staff. All of the concierges were fantastic as were the staff in the Regency Club lounge. Outside of Asia, I have yet to see a club that surpasses this one. The food was terrific (and based on how long people were hanging out around the dinner hour, we weren't the only ones who made it into dinner!) and the staff truly exceptional. My only complaint was how dated the guestrooms were. Not dirty or worn but still in need of updating. But the staff was SO good that I am still giving it 4 stars. The management can rightly be proud of their staff - reading other reviews I see that lots of people agree with me - the staff makes this hotel!",9-Jul-10,4
"Great location, staff was fabulous, bar/restaurant on top floor is nice with a great view, room price was reasonably priced as I was able to use a discount code. I would definitely stay here again!",29-Jun-10,5
"The location was great but hardly worth the price. Lots of great food close by. Room and hotel were not anything more then your standard 4 star business hotel. The only thing I remembered was that hotel parking was outrageous - but as they say, when in Rome.",28-Jun-10,3
"I spent 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. It is a standard business hotel. The decor/furnishings throughout the hotel are very generic, and could use significant updating. The staff at the hotel, however, was exceptional. This was particularly the case of those who worked in the Grand Club (concierge level). I wouldn't be keen to recommend this hotel to those who want a more stylish venue. That said, it's not a bad backup if the price is right.",23-Jun-10,3
"After a 14hour flight we checked in this hotel the staff was very friendly ,concierge was very helpful and we got a nice comfortable room though little small in size but clean. It is just one block from the Union square so the location is fantastic. Tram station is 2 minutes walk and there are couple of good restaurants close by. Buffet breakfast had a good spread and a good view of the city from the coffee shop",22-Jun-10,4
"I really liked this hotel as I was having issues finding a nice hotel at a fair price around Union Square that being said I think the Grand Hyatt is the best value in Union Square. I thought the hotel was very clean and well decorated. The rooms are decent, wicked soft beds, the TV was horrific, and the bathroom was clean and fairly spacious. My only comment about the view is you get what you pay for... what I mean is that if you book on priceline, expedia, orbitz, etc.... they give you the base ho-hum room, but you have the option to PAY for a better view either on hyatt.com or at check-in and to have a view of the bay its like $30-50 more per night which I think is highway robbery, but if they make money on that than so be it.The parking is incredibly easy, there is a 24-hr valet garage less than half a block away on Sutter they charged me $32 a night which for the location in SF that is dirt cheap. However charging $10 internet is a hose job. You get a $15 voucher for breakfast at the rooftop restaurant which is nice. The breakfast is excellent and the view is even better. However, make sure you know the hours of breakfast service because I got hosed on Mother's day because they stopped serving an hour earlier then the guest book says and as I checked out a little later that morning I noticed on the desk the flyers saying something about a mother day brunch thing... regardless I had no clue of the hour changes because I checked in 4 nights ago and complained to the desk person and he took off the $40 (4 day) internet charge for my trouble. I was more upset about not being able to eat there because the food is so good and the view is wonderful.Another issue I had was loud and rowdy people in the hall at 1AM. A quick call to the front desk eliminated the noise problem within minutes. I heard the elevator chime within 30 seconds of the call hang up. Its nice that security is fast and prompt here. Overall I would stay there again, if I wanted to be in Union Square. Two small flies in the ointment wont dissuade me from staying here again.",9-Jun-10,5
"Location wise it's a couple of miles from the main tourist ares but can walk and plenty of public transport options. Very close to the main shopping area though. Room was clean and comfortable. Bar and restaurant on top floor offers good value snacks, drinks and food and staff were very, very good. Concierge was excellent in helping with maps, excursions etc. Not ideal for kids but for couples on a city break or people on a business trip it offers a good standard and a reasoable price.",9-Jun-10,4
"I have just spent 4 wonderful nights in the Grand Hyatt. You could not ask for a more centrally located hotel to go shopping, dining, chilling out in union square over a coffee and of course the cable car terminal. After a very long trip from UK to San Fran, we were greeted at the front desk by `Wayne`, who was very pleasant, courteous and exactly the right person to greet you after a long haul. Checking in was a breeze and after chatting about our trip we were given a room higher up on the 29th floor overlooking Union Square. Wow!! What a view. Thanks again Wayne.The rooms are very clean, tidy and the beds are comfortable. Our room had a mini-bar, TV, Alarm clock with i-pod docking and the usual iron, hair dryer and coffee making facilities. There is a room safe for your valueables, but if you want you can also get a box at reception.There is a good gym on the 35th floor with the usual runners/cycles and x-trainers as well as weight machines. The kit all looks modern and you can plug your i-pod into them or watch TV on the individual screen. It does get busy around 0700. The staff and concierge are very polite and accomodating. They sell tour tickets on the open top bus at a discounted rate, the bus is definitely worth doing to get your bearings and introduce you to all the districts, plus it stops outside the Grand Hyatt and goes over the Golden Gate bridge.A definite must is to go to the 36th floor for a drink or just to look out the panoramic window for a view of the bay and coit tower. We were fortunate to have great clear weather and had a fantastic view. Absolotely Wonderful.We decided to eat in the restaurant, the service is very good and the duty manager made sure everything was to the customers satisfaction. The starters were great, but I felt the main didn`t match up to the 1st course and I have to say I have eaten better for less $$, although those times are few and far between. However, it is definitely worth the experience of looking out onto San Fran enjoying a meal and cool glass of wine, watching the sun set over the horizon, a definite tick in the box thing to do. If you don`t want a big meal, they also do bar food in the bar area and a to-go service.I cannot fault the service and experience I had staying here, perhaps because I was on a high floor added to the experience, but I would definitely go back to the Grand Hyatt, if I were to return to San Fran.",6-Jun-10,5
"One block off Union Square, this tall hotel is located in the core of the San Francisco shopping area. Having a small footprint, the lobby is efficient. There's no walking into this hotel and wondering where the front desk is. The concierge desk is manned by multiple people as befitting the demand for information at this location. The staff was uniformly helpful and friendly, providing solid timely advice on what to see, do, and how to get places. Bell, housekeeping and front desk staff were helpful and friendly without crossing the line to annoying or smarmy. We had a standard room on the floor with the club lounge. The lounge is well staffed and has excellent views Northward with no building blocking.The room itself was clean and offered sufficient room for the two of us. The bed was comfortable if a little firm. It was... a room. I stay in 70 or so hotel rooms a year and to be honest, this one was more or less average. That is not bad as I stay at Hyatt a lot for a reason (in fact I'm in one on the other side of the globe from SF as I write this review). It was a good room with good temperature control, but it really shines in comparison to those of the other upper end Hyatt product in central SF.We've been to SF many times. It is our getaway city. This was the first time we'd stayed at the Grand Hyatt and I'm happy to say that it won't be our last. Dependable, clean, helpful, friendly, and safe, everything you want in a downtown core hotel, the Grand Hyatt provides it to a consistently high standard. We will certainly be back.",22-May-10,4
"The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfortable, and the location was convenient. Unfortunately, there wasn't much sound-proofing, so we had a lot of noise from the neighbors and the hallway. Also, I had called in advance to request a room with a view of the bay, but we got a view of the parking lot next door. When I called the front desk to ask about switching, they were rude about the fact that I had bid on Priceline. All in all, it was worth it because I got a good deal, but had I paid full price I would have been very disappointed by the noise, view, and service.",17-May-10,3
"Pros: Great location, nice room view (but average size), top floor restaraunt/bar views of city were amazing. Food was good, but not great. Paid $179 for room - seems 'fair' but am sure other good options out there, too. Overall nice Hyatt quality comes at a steep price with hidden fees (see below)Cons: Hyatt will ""rape"" you in various charges and fees. Like charging $55 dollars for overnight car parking. Or $10 dollars for daily Wi-Fi connection. And if you use their in room phone to the tune of like $3 dollars a minute. It's straight up theft. I complained to management for a $60 dollar charge for 20 minute call and they seemed oblivious. I tried watching an in room movie VOD and the picture quality was terrible, too. Also, my room was near elevator shaft and I could hear the roar of the elevator in the bathroom sometimes.Was I satisfied overall? Yes. Would I stay there again? Probably not.",6-May-10,3
"My husband was taking a class in town, so we stayed for four nights and five days. This hotel, I thought, would be much more grand and the rooms a little fancier - everything about it was just average. I told the woman at the front desk that we were newlyweds, hoping for something cozy, and we ended up with a room facing the back of two other buildings. It was nothing like what I expected after seeing other reviews raving about the view. No view at all, even though the hotel was not exactly full. I would never pay the rates they want - which must be due to the proximity to Union Square. And they are ""steps away from Chinatown"" but also border an area of town that isn't very nice. I'm recommending only because I have friends who would love to be as close as this is to all of the stores.",5-May-10,3
"The hotel was easy to find and right on Union Square. As far as location goes I donâ€™t have any complaints. We pull up in front of the hotel and stop in the valet parking area. Kindly the valet attendant notified us of the daily parking rate and also a secondary parking location with a cheaper daily rate (not ran by the hotel). The secondary parking structure was around the corner. I didnâ€™t feel like driving anymore so I stayed with the original hotel valet and paid the extra $15 bucks a day. Checking in was seamless..Only a few people in line with plenty of staff to help out. The grand lobby area was not so impressive; maybe Iâ€™m becoming a snob because my last hotel stay was in the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Anyways, nothing really impressive about the entry way, but nonetheless we were on our way up to the room quickly.We booked one of the ""club level"" rooms with a view of the bay. Well, the room was very, very small for a semi suite. Yes, I do understand that San Francisco typically has small rooms, but that's way I paid the extra money to enjoy a little more room with some relaxing views. The bathroom was small and pretty standard, nothing to brag about. The television was probably a 27-inch tube style. The least you could do is pull out these old style TVâ€™s...donate them while they're still working and spend a couple hundred bucks for some nice flat screens. At least they should do that for the suites. The furniture seemed a little outdated...come to think of it the whole interior of the hotel seemed a little outdated. The view...yes we did see the bay, but it was hindered by the view of the roof tops on the nearby buildings. Not quite the enjoyable view I imagined, besides there wasn't any room to sit down and take it all in. After a quick relaxation on the bed we decided to go upstairs and enjoy some hors dâ€™oeuvres (not sure if I spelled that correctly) in the lounge specifically for ""club level"" guest. Again, nothing to really brag about here...the food was typical and nothing exciting. Only 1 television tucked away in the corner where only 2 tables could view it. At least the TV here was a decent size maybe a 40-inch LCD. I was able to catch some highlights of the NBA playoffs. The bar was an ""honor"" bar; basically you make your own drinks, fill out a card specifying how many and have it charged to your room. Not a bad choice of drinks...there was enough options to satisfy your thirst, also the soft drinks, water and coffee was free. After, leaving the lounge we decided to relax a little more before trying the hotel restaurant boasting of beautiful views. The bed was a little stiff and the sheets were standard, maybe a 200 thread count. After a little cat nap we started getting dressed and to my surprise, I canâ€™t seem to find a power outlet. The power outlets were all behind the night stand, the bed or the table. The table was easiest to get to but had several items plugged into it (coffee maker, telephone, lamp, TV). After crawling under the table to plug in the iron I noticed that there was an available outlet on the base of the lamp. That was the only outlet available in the whole entire room (besides the bathroom). Although, this was a leisure trip, I still work on my laptop; charge my cell, etc. etc. With this set-up I was only able to do one at a time. One plus was the iron itself...I'd have to say it was a great iron. A kinda funny giving prop to an iron, but it was worth mentioning. Ah the restaurants...nothing spectacular, not even the views. The food was sub-par but the drinks were poured nicely. Service was decent and the food was brought out in a timely manner. The views of the city lights were ok, but nothing to brag about. The price of the food was a little steep, but that was kind of expected. Walking out of the restaurant we passed a piano lounge/bar. It was very crowded, and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. We decided to hit the streets of SF instead. The fitness center was pretty much what you need in a fitness center. Had all the basicsâ€_treadmills, stationary bikes, dumbbells, resistance machines and televisions. I used the treadmill for awhile and the resistance machines without incident. Towels and water was readily available. Check out was just as seamless as check in. We paid our additional expenses and in our vehicle within 5 minutes. Overall not a bad stay, but we were expecting a little more. Hope this helps.Thanks!",1-May-10,3
"The Grand Hyatt was in a great location, right at the edge of Union Square. Itâ€™s about a block away from a cable car stop, which is very convenient. You can walk to some of the popular tourist spots, but it would be a long walk, especially with the all the hills in San Francisco. The hotel was clean and nice, but not overly luxurious. It was definitely a little dated, but still comfortable. The service from everyone we encountered was very friendly and helpful.",27-Apr-10,4
I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. From some of the reviews I expected a tired old property in need of renovation. This was not the case. The rooms are a bit on the small side but that is to be expected in the city. They are tastefully decorated. The bathroom appeared to have been redone fairly recently. Overall the room was clean and comfortable. The location and views cannot be beat. Enjoy your stay.,25-Apr-10,4
"Whilst its true the hotel is due for refurbishment (front desk said the gradual process was to start late 2010) I found the room and the furnishing to be quite acceptable and the bed, the most important thing in the room, was huge, incredibly comfortable and the bedding fresh clean and of high quality - resulting in a great night's sleep.The staff were all great - friendly and enthusiastic - from front desk, to doormen to the executive lounge staff. The breakfast there was adequate in quantity and quality, but get there early for the view! Free wifi is available in the lounge too, though it closes early at 2100.Location has been enthused about before, and the view from my room was stunning, it has to be said.",10-Apr-10,4
"I can't say enough about the great experience my friend and I had at the Grand Hyatt.The room was more than adequate, the good rate included breakfast (anything on the menu), parking was a bit expensive but we received a 25% discount. Only negative was to pay for internet - in this day and age - guests should receive free internet. This amenity is free from a Best Western to a Bed & Breakfast, why not at a large hotel chain? The staff, from the doorman, to the bellman, front desk, concierge, and wait staff went out of their way to be accommodating and upbeat.",8-Apr-10,5
"We stopped over for two nights in San Francisco to do a college tour for our teenage son after spending several days in Monterey. This was our third straight year we have stayed at the Grand Hyatt while visiting the city and our fourth stay overall.As usual we walked almost everywhere, to the Westfield Mall and the Powell Street BART station, North Beach, the Financial District and over to the Ferry Building. We requested a room on the Gold Passport Floor and received access to the Regency Lounge located on the 32nd floor. This is a great place for a light breakfast in the morning and we enjoyed juice, hot coffee, fresh fruit and muffins on our last day there. This was a lot less stressful than standing in line for an hour to have breakfast at one of the small and popular cafes at the edge of the Tenderloin which we did the previous day.Service from the front desk, concierge, bellmen, the host at the Regency Club and room staff was professional and courteous. I noticed that the door and bellmen kept a close but discrete watch of people entering the lobby area, which I really appreciated and took as a sign of additional security for the hotel guests. We checked out early but asked the hotel to hold our luggage until it was time to go out to the airport. I liked that they placed our bags in a secured area off the lobby and asked us to go in with them to point out our luggage, insuring everything we stored came out.We enjoyed our short stay here and are pleased with the level of accommodations, location and service we received. There may be nicer, more luxurious properties and expensive properties to stay at in San Francisco, but we are comfortable with the Grand Hyatt and intend to return on our next visit.",8-Apr-10,4
"For the price I could not complain really; I've seen this property at it's best in years past. Stayed this time for a great rate found through my travel agent. Fantastic location, dated hardware. Personnel could be more personable really. Nothing horrible. Concierge (Elaine) was fantastic - she has been there for years as i recall. Beds comfortable. Rooms clean. Great views from Grand View bar. Restaurant reallllly lacks. Furniture is very worn and tired. It's time the owners of this property face the music and dump the milliions in this property required to bring it up to 2010. SF has so many cute and nice hotels in this area next time I will ask for recommendations of boutique nature - this occassion was more about affordability.",6-Apr-10,3
"Made reservations for two rooms for two couples a month in advance using a coupon that included a discounted price of $150 and free breakfast. Recieved perfect e-confirmation of reservation. Arrived first and front desk was unable to find the reservation and did not want to honor coupon. Front desk even suggested that I go somewhere??? and print out my confirmation, even though I had the confirmaiton number!!!, and come back. Finally remade the reservation for both rooms and the front desk agreed to honor the coupon. Went up to room: shower head broken, light bulb burned out, coffee maker broken. These things were fixed the next day. When our friends arrived the front desk could again not find the reservation and hassled them out of the coupon for a room. After three days we left, checking over the bill we were charged for beer we never drank out of the room bar, a movie we never watched, and the breakfast that was supposed to be included. My boyfriend paid a corrected bill. Our friends paid for their room. A week later I saw a $300 charge on my credit card and called the Grand. Apparently I was charged for no-showing on the original reservation!!!! Incredible as it sounds, it took me two weeks and three phone calls to fix. Ughhhhh!",26-Mar-10,2
I was there to attend a red carpet event. The BAFTA awards!! Well this place was real grand and luxurious!,23-Mar-10,4
"I had a good time at this hotel, with only one complaint, the noise! The rooms are very clean, the beds are incredibly comfortable, and the staff are truly friendly. My only compaint was noise coming from a party of drunken/high guests in the next room. The staff was very accomodating of my concerns, and I would be happy to stay here in the future. Also, this hotel is very expensive for the quality, if you purchase your room at the published price. Check around the discount sites, and you should be able to find it at a much lower rate. ** Be Sure to Check Out the Bar on the Top Floor, Great View of the Bay! **",17-Mar-10,4
"Loved it. Were treated like royalty the entire time. Hotel is in perfect location. Customer service is A+. Check out hotel on the top floor. Amazing view of the city and harbor including Alcatraz. Pillows and bed are incredibly comfy- hard to get out of bed! Try the room service..amazing. Nothing but great things to say about this place. Luxury, luxury, luxury.",14-Mar-10,5
We liked the Grand Hyatt. It was recommended to us by our travel agent.,27-Feb-10,4
"This is a very good location near Union Square. As a Hyatt Diamond, I was given some nice amenities promptly after check-in. Our room was very small, but that's what I'd expect in a SF hotel. The view was amazing, it was a beautiful view of Union Square and the big Christmas tree there. The lounge upstairs was always very crowded, and it was hard to even find a seat. The selection of snacks and drinks was pretty good, though. The view from the lounge was also very nice. For the price of the hotel, I thought it was only an average value. I will want to try a different hotel for my next visit to SF, but I would not be opposed to staying here again.",26-Feb-10,3
"We just got back from a three-day weekend trip to the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, and this was the best hotel experience we've had in quite some time. The room was comfortable, the location unbeatable, and the staff incredible. We arrived early on Saturday; I'd requested early check-in, but knew that showing up at 9:30am was really pushing it. However, it was no problem at all; we were checked in right away, with the requested view. The room was on the smaller side, and the two armchairs felt unnecessary and cramped, but it was nothing a little reorgnaizing couldn't fix. Grandviews restuarant for breakfast and take-out for lunch was excellent. Very good food for a reasonable price, and top-notch service. The bellmen staff were always attentive and friendly. We got a great deal directly through the Hyatt site, and I would certainly recommend this hotel as a great place for a couple on a weekend away; location is really great and within a five or ten-minute walk of great shopping and delicious restaurants. We were with our young son, and it was also perfect for a young family. He had the time of his life, as did we, and we can't wait to return!",16-Feb-10,5
"This hotel is exhausted. The rooms are dirty, everyhting is old and is desperately in need of an extensive upgrade. Only the Concierge was good.",12-Feb-10,1
"Grand Hyatt San Francisco, a hotel in the hearth of San Francisco, very close to China Town, no need to have a car, perfect conexions with local public traffic. If you like to go to Napa Valley then you need a car or a tour.",5-Feb-10,4
"The hotel is comfortable, nice layout downstairs/easy to navigate around, good customer service and great location. Parking/TransportaionI suggest using public transportation or taxi and not drive yourself The 'space' holds no more than 7 cars and is a shared taxi stand with poor signs and costs about $50/dayRoomsThe rooms are clean & quiet, but very small and need remodeling. They are fine for a single business traveler. The beds are comfortable which is a plus.ServiceFront desk staff and concierge were great. The bell/bag staff appeared lazy and took me effort to get their attention to hold our bags while we went to breakfast. Definatlely not a warm and friendly feel.",3-Feb-10,4
"I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt Several times since I get a special nightly rate there because of my job. I choose this hotel most of the time because of its location. It's located right on Union Square, across the street from Niketown. There's also a Starbucks across the street and Macy's and all the fashionable upscale stores (Tiffany's, LV, Gucci, etc...) are within 5-10 minute walking distance. Most importantly, there are tons of restaurants in this part of town. The Grand Hyatt is about a 10-15 cab ride to Fisherman's Wharf.As far as the room, the beds were comofortable and I had a very good night's sleep. The room was very clean and did not notice anything out of the ordinary. Like any upscale hotel, they overcharge with the items in the mini-bar.Peoples main complaint is the parking, which is $50 per night, valet only. Unfortunately, parking is expensive for ALL hotels in SF not just the Hyatt. If you want to save money, I suggest parking down the street at a parking garage for about $25 per night. I was fortunate to find street parking, since the meters are not running on the weekends.Lastly, I recommend checking out the bar at the top floor of the hyatt. You have an incredible view of San Francisco, and you jaw will drop because of this view while you're having a martini.",3-Feb-10,4
"I traveled to SF to see the renovated California Academy of Sciences. I used to live in the Bay Area, so when I visit SF I tend to have a singular purpose. I don't spend a lot of time wandering the streets like a tourist, although I still like to window shop. This hotel is in a nice location near a lot of good shopping and convenient to BART and the cable car. My room had an excellent view of the Bay, Coit Tower, the Bay Bridge, and the TransAmerica Building. It was a picture postcard view and was the highlight of my stay. Otherwise, the room was rather small and uninspired. The bathroom could use a remodel. The clock radio did not work, which was annoying to us both because we wanted to hear music and because we wanted the alarm. The hotel lacked charm and glamour. At this price point you might not be able to do too much better, but if you can spend a little more you can get more elsewhere. Be warned that parking here may set you back as almost much as the room itself. It cost me $50 to park each night and after factoring in taxes my $120 room became a $200 room and that was without room service. For $200 I would stay elsewhere, but if you are a tourist without a car it's not a bad deal. We walked over to the Four Seasons for breakfast just to see what that was like and we weren't impressed, but I'm sure it was better than Hyatt's overpriced offerings. I had an excellent experience in the past with the concierge at this hotel and I want to remark that the front desk staff did a good job on this visit. They allowed me to check-in very early (and very efficiently). The valets took some time to retrieve my car and my experience with them was spotty. Overall, it was an acceptable stay but I felt it was not a great value. If not for the superb view I would have been miffed.",2-Feb-10,3
"I really wanted to love the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco. The location is fantastic. The staff was so friendly, helpful and welcoming. The city view from our room was lovely. But the rooms...ugh. Really tired and shabby. There were weird stains on the lampshades, holes in the curtains, scuffs all over the walls. The room was comfortable, just really rough around the edges and worn out. Also, when we checked out there were a lot of people waiting for their cars outside and we were told it would take up to 1/2 hour to get our car from the valet. It didn't actually end up taking quite that long for us, but there were others still standing there who'd been waiting before we were. Considering there is a huge parking garage (much cheaper) at the corner of Stockton and Sutter, we could have parked the car ourselves and walk across the street. I would only consider staying here again if the hotel undergoes a renovation. There are way too many other great places to stay in the city for this price.",1-Feb-10,3
"As a Hyatt Platinum member I stay at many Hyatt properties (as well as many other hotels). This was my first visit to this property - and likely my last. After a delayed check-in, seemingly caused by not enough desk personnel, I got to my room. The carpet was worn (poorly repaired) and soiled. The furnishing were very worn - and clearly not up to Hyatt standards. When I shared my complaint the hotel staff that responded were concerned and seemed to understand the problem. I was told that there would be a complete renovation of the hotel in the next six months. So, check if you're considering this property to see if the renovations have been completed. If not, stay elsewhere.",20-Jan-10,2
"Perfect for what we needed, a nice clean hotel in a good location. We stayed 2 nights book-ending a trip to Sonoma. We had concierge level which is always nice and the lounge was very comfortable with nice cheese/cracker/wine selections for cocktail hour and delicious breakfast selections. A very comfortable couch and private business center with free internet access. The rooms themselves were very comfortable, nothing too special but what you'd expect for a GH. We did have a nice view from the top floors and I did appreciate all of the extra mirrors in the room aside from the one in the bathroom. The fitness center was above average for a hotel in my opinion with plenty of new cardio machines, weights and mats etc. We also checked out the restaurant/bar on the top floor at night which was a spectacular view on a clear evening.One downside was there was no gift shop in the hotel selling snacks/toiletries/magazines. I guess they want people to buy stuff from the mini bar, but I think they should offer that even for a bottle of water. We arrived later in the evening one night and there was no options and no vending machines on any of the floors. Annoying.",15-Jan-10,3
"First timer at GRAND HYATT, and it was a very nice stay. Arrived when there were multiple conferences/conventions going on with most everyone of them already checked-in ... so expecting the worst of rooms. Had requested a high floor room, and the super nice front desk (Wayne?!) did some searching, and was able to find one. Nice ! Here are my assessments:LOCATION: Right on Union Square shopping. Shopper's heaven! Very close to Chinatown, restaurants, and cable car stops. Reasonable reach for everything else.ROOM: Great view on the 30th floor, overlooking city ... facing SF bay, Coit Tower, Transamerica building, etc.... very nice. (2) comfortbale double-beds, including desk with coffee maker, side chair, TV armoire, and minibar/fridge. Need to update TV however ... from the dark ages. Curiously, no chair for the desk... a minus. In-room safe as well as all standard toiletries for bathroom. Very roomy closet.DECOR: Nice, basic, expected decor for a Grand Hyatt. Lobby was very convention-y and somewhat cold (appearance wise). No large seating area, and somewhat small ... which filled up with people quickly from the conferences, etc..SERVICE: A++ PERFECT front desk personnel. Worked on the room requested, and got it. Very friendly, conscientious, and even called to room ... just as I arrived, to make sure everything was ok. Did not use bellhop, valet, concierge or room service to assess. No complaints here at all.OVERALL: Would I stay here again? Yes. I would recommend it, given its convenience to all, comfortable, clean rooms, and wonderful, friendly service.",12-Jan-10,4
"This hotel was incredible. It is located in the heart of San Fransisco next to China Town, amazing shopping and restaurants. The service was great and rooms were luxurious. Everything was very clean and extravagant. Though the rooms were great with comfy beds, there were not a lot of accommodations provided. Internet was an additional cost, no fridge and no breakfast.",7-Jan-10,5
"This is a big city hotel. It is hard to unload from as there is little room to pull in, so it suits airline passengers more I would imagine.It has wonderful staff who open doors for you, but the rooms are very dated, the bathrooms particularly.We had awful trouble with our billing at this hotel too, where the credit cards were credited and debited over and over for no apparent reason which was annoying.I can't help feeling a little ripped off in a hotel like this where you pay top rates for the rooms, then pay for internet, parking and ridiculously high prices for room service.Everything was as it should be service wise, it was just lacking that special something.I would probably recommend you find a smaller boutique hotel instead.",6-Jan-10,3
Good location and helpful staff but the hotel seems outdated. Elevators need to be upgraded. Bath tub was clogged but problem was resolved quickly by maintenance. The rooms were quite small and dated. $35/day parking. Don't expect too much for this Grand Hyatt.,5-Jan-10,3
"Yes the walls are thin, I really heard a neighbor's phone ringing and her answering it, also people walking down hall. Windows are large, but not sound tight. The room was outdated and there was no robe or other sundries in room. No free wifi, bed was slopey and mediocre. The concierge was not too helpful and the lounge staff would not seat you in the part with the nice view at 10 am because it was ""for lunch."" What? Did not feel like we were at a posh hotel. This was not what I was expecting from a 4 star! PS, if you decide to stay here, park at the Union Square garage yourself and save $15 (It's $48 for the valet to park it there for you vs $32 for 24 hours to do it yourself--SAME PLACE.)",4-Jan-10,3
"whenever I travel I like the Hyatt brand worldwide. This hotel is in a great location right on union square. but it is tired. the rooms are outdated and relly the whole site needs a revamp.the club lounge is about 10x too small. it simply cannot handle the number of guests. when you compare this lounge to that in the GH Hong Kong, they just do not compare.",2-Jan-10,3
"One star because I have to, dedicated to the staff at the Grandviews lounge who are polite and friendly and gave somewhat of a Hyatt style service.The reason for the bad review is the same as other Yelpers: paper thin walls. Last night (yes, NYE no less) the four of us returned to my friend's hotel room after the bars has shut down for a little sparkling wine and to chat. Even just having a discussion at a normal level (no whooping, hollering, loud laughter) was enough to have someone banging on the door and security showing up to tell us to be quiet!Not Hyatt quality, certainly not Grand Hyatt level.Don't stay here unless you plan on whispering past midnight...",1-Jan-10,1
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for three nights immediately prior to Thanksgiving.My flight from Australia arrived at 10:30 am and I went straight to the hotel from the airport. I was able to check in immediately and was given a room on the 11th floor overlooking Union Square. The good sized room had a standard layout. Wardrobe (with personal safe) and separate drawer space were perfectly adequate. Bathroom fittings were fine, with good quality towels, soap, shampoo, toothpaste etc. There was plenty of hot water (with good water pressure) at all times.The bed and especially the pillows were extremely comfortable. The TV was located in an armoire and provided a good choice of channels.The hotel has 6 elevators, which means that guests never have to wait long when either ascending to the rooms or descending to the lobby. A very big plus in my book.The location of the hotel in Stockton Street is ideal. Market Street is a short walk away and leads the dedicated shopper past numerous department stores. The closest street car is a block away. I didnâ€™t have a car and was able to get round the city either on foot or on public transport.All the staff I encountered at the Grand Hyatt couldnâ€™t have been more pleasant. I will definitely stay there again on a future visit to San Francisco.",12-Dec-09,5
"We booked this hotel a month in advance thinking of it to be in perfect location and excited to get the ""Hyatt"" experience. We were in for a shocking surprise. This hotel is very old and not at all well maintained. We were given a room next to the laundry service even though repeatedly asking for a room with a nice view. The rooms are too small(which is okay considering the hotel location) and old. The closet door and desk chair were broken(door came out when we tried to open it). The bathroom looks like one in a roadside motel with a constant stinking smell coming from the drains. At one point water came out of the bathtub drain.  We were going to stay there for 3 nights but could not bear more than 1 night. We moved to the nearby Omni hotel which is few blocks away where we got a master suite for half the price. Omni experience was something else: huge rooms, amazing service, great luxurious bathrooms and good location too. Why waste money in a dump when you can get a great hotel for half the price?Definitely not worth a 4 star.",3-Dec-09,1
"Got a great deal on Priceline two days in advance of our annual black Friday boondoggle. This location just cannot be beat. It is one half block up from Union Square. The lobby was busy when we arrived with people coming and going-they had several doormen and valets on duty. Even though we arrived at a busy time and two hours ahead of the scheduled check in we were immediately greeted and given our room. The front desk was very, very gracious and accomodating of the fact that I had accidently shown up with no credit card in my wallet!!  As we waited for the elevator, we noticed a lady really struggling to get out of the elevator with a really big rolling suitcase. An employee jumped in out of nowhere to help her and asked others if they needed help. Very nice-I love to see people make extra effort when it comes to service. The lobby is nothing exciting. It's long and narrow, the front desk is to the right as you enter and the elevators to the left. Behind the elevators is a small seating area which they had decorated for the holidays.  Our room was on the 21st floor. We looked out to the Westin St. Francis (my daughter was fascinated by their outside elevators), the Sir Francis Drake Hotel and Starlight Room and the tiny peek of Union Square. When I book rooms on bidding sites. . I expect to get one of the ""lesser rooms"", that's fair enough. But this room did not seem to be sub-par in anyway. It was spacious and clean and I liked the location on a high floor. We were right next to the housekeeping closet and expected to have some noise from that in the morning, but that did not happen. They are either very quiet or it's a little used closet. The bed was super comfortable with nice linens. If you were there on a more extended stay, there was plenty of room to put your things. A spacious closet, two dressers. TV is in an amoire with a Mini bar/fridge - the sensor kind so you can't use the fridge for your own stuff. There's a desk and chair and a small sitting area with arm chair and table by the window. Liked the iPod docking port. The ONLY thing about the room that wasn't perfect is, as others have mentioned, the furniture is a little banged up.The only storage in the bathroom is the countertop. Nice, Portico brand white ginger soap and shampoo and a little tube of toothpaste!  We didn't eat at the Grandview on the 36th floor but went up to look at it and it was BEAUTIFUL with a spectacular view!! We would have had a drink in the bar but it was full. I would recommend this hotel for service, cleanliness, spacious room and awesome location. Especially if you get the $66 price tag that we did!! Have fun!",1-Dec-09,5
"I attended a conference at the Hilton but chose this place for lodging. Having membership with both, I found Hyatt treats Gold Passport members a little better than Hilton treats HHonors members.There is much to like about this hotel: A great central location; Walgreen's is next door; 24-Hour Fitness is three blocks east; Good department stores are close by; This is a high rise building so the views from the restaurant, club level and rooms on the upper floors are equally incredible from all directions; The hotel staff is courteous and well trained; The Grand Club concierges are extremely accommodating; The Hyatt Grand Bed is very comfortable; and The showers have good water pressure.Although some other bloggers have commented about the hotel being â€œdated,â€ù the Grand Hyatt still felt a bit more upscale than the Hilton. The Hilton guest rooms felt like a Vegas hotel at the bad end of the strip.A few small things I didnâ€™t like: Old fashion TVs; Bathrooms with dated and claustrophobic standard tub/shower combo (A curved shower rod would be a relatively inexpensive fix); The $25 breakfast buffet with no omelet station... nope, canâ€™t even special order an omelet from the kitchen... particularly vexing since the Hyatt Fishermanâ€™s Wharf (20 blocks to the north) has a breakfast buffet complete with omelet station for $18. Whatâ€™s up with that? Be warned, the valet is very, very slow. At $55 per day for valet parking, this was unacceptable! Also, prepare to take a cab ride for good food. Dining choices near the hotel are limited and unremarkable.Other tips: Request upper floors to get away from street noise and upgrade to the club level if possible. If you want to a break from the $30 to $50 per person dinner checks typical in SF, Tommyâ€™s Joint is a great â€œdownscaleâ€ù option for good food. It is located at Van Ness and Geary, about at a 15 minute walk west of the hotel. It is a barbeque/sports bar thatâ€™s been in continuous operation since 1947. You can eat well for less than $10/person.Overall, I still give the highest rating because the staff at Grand Hyatt San Francisco treats guests so well. Like our â€œGovernatorâ€™ says: â€œIâ€™ll be back!",25-Nov-09,5
"Nice hotel with regard to rooms and fitness service offered. But no free wireless Internet, not even in the hotel lobby!!",23-Nov-09,3
"This is 'the hotel' for our trips to San Francisco. 1) Location is the best ( we love Union square, but 5-10 minutes walk from Market can easily spoil the pleasure. Hyatt is located right at the Union sq.) ); 2)Staying with Hyatt garanties above-average level of service and comfort, 3) We love the bar on top floor: view is unbeatable and even food last time was really good and fresh. Rooms vary, some are nice, some are ok. Our last room was just 'ok', but had a million $ view. Since this is in the downtown, it can be noisy, even at night ( we kind of enjoy it as a part of city atmosphere).",22-Nov-09,5
"Booked and paid for a bay view room. The room itself was good, although they need updating, the bay view was small patches of water in between buildings.Paid extra for the club lounge, this really was hit and miss. Come afternoon tea/dessert they would have ONE cake delivered for the whole club and (so we were told) were not allowed any more, so if you arrived ten minutes after it arrived there was nothing except a few pretzel sticks. Breakfast was basic fare and evening canapes were minimal and lacking in quality. The hotel is very well positioned, the front desk staff friendly and accommodating.Wouldn't stay here again, as it has been said before, there are many more hotels better than this.",17-Nov-09,3
I booked this hotel via a discount website and was extremely happy with the value. The room had a nice view and was comfortable for 3 adults. There were no noise issues and the view of Embarcadero was nice. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. We had to request additional towels but delivery was prompt. We didn't eat at the hotel but entertainment and restaurants were within walking distance. The touristy area is about a mile away but we didn't have any safety issues and walking that far was refreshing due to its proximity to the bay. The management was nice enough to allow a very late checkout and I did not have any additional fees added to my bill.,10-Nov-09,4
"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco for a four day weekend get-a-way. I was quite pleased with most aspects of the hotel although it is showing signs of wear and could use a bit of freshening up. We stayed on the 33rd floor in a Club King room with access to the Club Lounge on the 32nd floor. Our room was small but very clean and the comfortable and the view was fantastic. Access to the club lounge brings with it a contintental breakfast, afternoon snacks and evening desserts. Sodas, bottled water and sparkling water is available from 6 am to 9 pm at no additional cost. There is also a computer with printer available for use at no fee. The view from the lounge is also fantastic with a clear view of the bay.The staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and helpful. We did not try the restaurant or lounge on the 36th floor but I would definitely stay there again. It's location is perfect for access to Chinatown, Nob Hill, nearby shopping, Market Street, restaurants etc.",2-Nov-09,4
"The doormen give the hotel a plush sort of feeling to it. Kind of a priviliged feeling there. Liked the conference room. Had an internet room, that charged about six dollars to use the internet for about 15 minutes at a time. Busy, busy hotel. The room service was above and beyond what I expected in a hotel. I wasn't feeling well that day and they seemed to cater to me even more. They have a nice, nice restaurant on the top of the building and you can see quite a bit of San Francisco from there. The food was delicious and the waiters were very kind and accommodating. Busy front desk. We went to Fisherman's Wharf, which we had to take a taxi from our hotel to get there. Interesting to see and seeing the view of Alcatraz was surreal. Didn't take the tour to Alcatraz, but did take a bus tour and had a wonderful tour of the city with a great tour guide. I don't know that I would care to revisit San Francisco, though the shopping around the hotel seemed pretty awesome, with many designer named stores. We visited Chinatown, which was walking distance from the hotel and which is intriquing to see. My reason for not desiring to see San Francisco again is that people seemed rushed there, which is not a comfortable environment to walk into when you are travelling.. I did hear though that if we had time that we should have seen the surrounding San Francisco area, the bay area and the wine country. The hotel was a nice retreat to return to vs. the rushed environment outside of the hotel.",27-Oct-09,4
"We went to a confrence as I had not visited San Francisco for about 10 years. We were pleasantly surprised with the Grand Hyatt. We arrived about 10 am in hopes of checking in early, I was guessing we would be declined until 2pm , but the front desk stepped it up and were very cordial to let us check in, After a bad flight it was nice to kick back and relax. The rooms are small so it takes a bit of getting used to but we chose to explore the city instead, This property sits on Union Square so there is plenty to do with in walking distance. We went to Fishersmans Wharf one of the days and its worth doing, The old cable cars are a hoot and cheap too. The down side of FW is that there are tons of panhandlers that are very agressive. We didnt see any of SFPD in the 4 hours we were there.A little wierd but thats what SF is. Plenty of tee shirt and gift stores with several restaurants. ( My wife was pleased to buy a knockoff Prada purse for 35 bucks!)",27-Oct-09,4
Great location!Extremely clean!Little bit out-of-date ....,26-Oct-09,3
"We stayed for 3 nights for the PGA Presidents Cup at the Grand Hyatt. We were very happy with the hotel and especially liked the location. We did not have a car and were able to ride the BART from the airport and walk the short way to the hotel. We were also able to easily catch a cab from the hotel if we wanted to, but we also walked to the wharf. We had a good dinner at the Grand Views restaurant with a beatiful sunset to go with it. We had a great time watching Fleet week airshows, touring on the segways and biking the Golden Gate bridge. (we opted for the electric bikes-only way to go). The weather was great part of the time and freezing the rest of the time-darn it. It was a great weekend and alot of fun at the golf tourney on Sunday. We will definately go back to SF and we will probably stay at the Grand Hyatt again next time.",19-Oct-09,4
"Just my thoughts: The hotel was ok, not too great for being a Hyatt.-Valet parking is $50 overnight, and you have to wait for max 1/2 hour for your car to arrive.-The bar on the 36th floor closes at 1 pm, but stops serving food at 12. -There isnt a fan in the bathroom so the mirrors steam upon the other hand...-there was hot water-the beds were really comfy-prime spot..peferct for walking everywhereOther than that it was ok, your not really in the hotel too much so I can't complain. I just thought it would be better since its a Hyatt...",12-Oct-09,2
"We've stayed at the Grand Hyatt 5 or 6 times, the most recent over Labor Day weekend. We are local, but when we go to the City and stay at the Hyatt it's like we are a thousand miles away. As many posters have said, the location is perfect right in Union Square, close to all shops and many great restaurants. The hotel itself is very nice and we generally stay on the club level which gives us access to their private lounge. Very nice for breakfast and snacks. The view from the lounge is also awesome! Rooms are small and yes, a little dated, but Iâ€™ve always found them clean and comfortable. I've never had an issue with noise either from the hallway or other rooms. Rates for hotel can be all over the place. Sometimes I look and they are well over $300, other times in the mid to high $100's. I feel extremely comfortable recommending at a rate of $199 or even as high as $249. Over that, I'd say you may want to look elsewhere. Finally, parking is expensive (I think $49) but you can park in the lot directly across the street (Sutter & Stockton garage) for much less.",9-Oct-09,4
"I enjoyed the service and the people there were great! When I first arrived at the hotel there were people there to escort my belongings to the inside of the hotel and then I was able to be carefree about signing in. The service was fast and quick. I really did love the people there. The stay at Hyatt San Francisco was a trip to never forget! I will be sure to tell others about this hotela and how I had a great stay there! On top of that, I was able to meet the man of my dreams! Thank You",8-Oct-09,5
"The Grand Hyatt is situated one block from Union Square and within walking distance to many of San Francisco's greatest attractions. Room was fine. I was surprised that there was no desk in the room. There was a small corner table where I had to work and plugging in the laptop was a bit difficult. Outlets were hard to find.Still, they had a great AAA rate and you can't beat the location. Perfect for leisure travel.Rooftop restaurant/lounge is worth checking out. Beautiful views of the city.",8-Oct-09,4
"I stay in over 200 hotels a year and this is one of the stand-outs, great people, great service and great views all make for a wonderful experience",8-Oct-09,5
"We stayed at the Hyatt for 5 days, I thought the location was perfect, it was right beside union square, which was nice when you got a little turned around while walking. All you had to find was union square and you seen your hotel. We got there very early (about 8:30am) They told us people from 2 rooms had checked out and gave us a choice between great view but 2 double beds or ok view with king, if we wanted to check in early. We decided on the great view. We were able to check in an hour later. The service from the front desk to the housekeeping was exceptional. The first day house keeping came to the room, very early, we told her we will be out of the room every day by 10am so after that she never came until after 10, but was always done by 12. The conciere was helpful with any thing we wanted. The front desk even gave us a late check out at no extra charge. We hope to come back next year and we will stay here again.",6-Oct-09,4
"This was my first stay at the Grand Hyatt and overall I'd say that the service I received from the Front Desk staff and doormen were the things that truly made my stay go above and beyond just average. The decor in the lobby and rooms was nice, but nothing that was great or fabulosity personified. I found the Housekeeping staff to be a bit pushy about wanting to push me out of my room by calling me and knocking on my door repeatedly (and then giving me the evil eye while they stood around in a group right outside my door when I did finally leave my room after the first day), but the Room Service staff were highly proficient and thorough in completing tasks. When I arrived the lobby was filled with throngs of people milling about in different groups and employees going about their duties and I got discouraged thinking that it would take forever to be noticed, as I was traveling by myself, and get checked into my room. To my surprise, I was noticed by a wonderful woman named Isabella who beckoned me over and greeted me with a smile and kindness with no hint of stress or strain in her demeanor or voice and she deftly checked me in. When she told me that I was in a nonsmoking room and I asked if a smoking was available she told me that none were for that day, but that there was starting on the next day of my stay and she made all the arrangements to have my reservation moved to the new room on the next day and all I had to do was leave my packed bags in my room when I left for the day and the staff would move my belongings for me and she even upgraded me from the 4th floor to the 19th floor (truly as other reviews have stated, the views on the upper floors are to die for and would be worth paying extra for if necessary). Needless to say, I was grateful and extremely pleased with the service I received. When it came time for my original check out date, I decided that I was having too much fun in San Francisco (how can you not in that great city?!?) and that I wanted to stay for another day, so I went down to the Front Desk and inquired about doing so and the staff member who helped me was happy to accommodate my request and did so with a smile. On the day that I was leaving, I was running late and left in a harried rush and was obviously noticed by the Doorman who asked my destination and I informed him that I intended on taking a cab to the airport, and he told me that he could see I was rushing and offered a Lincoln Towncar from the hotel fleet for the same price as the cab. Of course I accepted the offer, if for no other reason than the extra comfort of the leather seats and better suspension on the vehicle, and then I heard the Doorman tell the driver that I seemed to be running late and to ""step on it"". I was impressed that I never once told him how really late that I was, yet he observed my demeanor and took the initiative of his own accord to let the driver know my situation to see if it would help get me to the airport on time....which it did. I barely made my flight, but I made it. Overall, the accommodations at this hotel were pleasant and somewhat appropriate for the price point, my interactions with the Housekeeping staff left something to be desired, but the negative of those brief interactions was far overshadowed by the excellent above par service that I received from the Front Desk staff and Door staff. I'd recommend this hotel if asked about it, but I don't think I would necessarily go out of my way to suggest it to someone if asked for names of hotels in the area to stay at.",29-Sep-09,4
"From the moment we entered, the conceirge and staff behind the desk (Sebastian), were so helpful, attentitive and friendly. The location of this hotel is fantastic. Walk to everything.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco who wants to be close to city centre, shops and restaurants. If I had been travelling with my family (kids), I would probably consider staying at Fisherman's Wharf.",25-Sep-09,5
"After my stay at the Hyatt in Monterey I arrived at the hotel with some intrepidation - this was quickly put to sleep on my arrival - great doorman and bell captain welcoming me to the hotel and escorting me to the front desk. The front desk experience was exceptional, a warm welcome and ask how my vacation was to date - apologies for my below average stay in Monterey and an upgrade to the Club Floor as way of an apology.The hotels location is fantastic just up from union square which makes the hotel very accessible to all the sights, BART, MUNI and cable cars. The hotel is on 36 floors and it is worth paying for an upgrade for a view of the bay - stunning vistas of the bay, Alcatraz and South San Francisco.Rooms are comfortable and clean, I had some of the best night sleeps of my trip here, but the rooms are on the old style and could do with some modernisation but not enough to ruin a stay in my opinion.The club floor is great as you get complimentary continental breakfast, evening snacks, and desserts as well as complimentary soft drinks and hot beverages - there's plentiful supplys of all and it gets refreshed continuously.The concierge team were fantastic and knew everything you could possibly want to do and ask for in San Francisco and can help you with the organisation of it all.First class service here - and you were made to feel like a VIP",24-Sep-09,5
"I agree with past opinions as I reviewed as well before we booked this flight on FunJet. We got a great price with flight and hotel for $435.00 a person for nights/5 days from Milwaukee, WI. The best about the hotel is the location and the service. It is in a prime location and was super easy to get to from airport by taking the Bart train for only $8.00 a person and then walked up a few blocks. We arrived at noon and our check in was for 3:00 pm, the front desk was able to check us in early and checked us in to floor 21 rather than 3-12 level our FunJet reservations called for. So, we were delighted with that. First impressions of room was nice, a little outdated with decor and TV and it did smell a little musty, but we had the air conditioning on the whole time. The bed was ""all that"" with the comfort and the pillows. That was our favorite part of the room. For the price we paid for our vacation, the hotel was what we thought it would be. We walked everywhere in the city from our hotel. We are walkers to begin with by the way....but Fisherman's Whalf was a 2 mile walk away. Within a mile or so was Nob Hill and Lombard Street, and Chinatown, North Beach were even closer. We got a good workout and then didn't feel as guilty about eating yummy food everyday! San Fran was a great trip and we did the main tourist things. We did Alcatraz (buy tickets ahead of time) saw the above mentioned and did a ferry boat trip to Sausilito which was pretty cool. The streets blew me away of how some are so steep, that was crazy to me. The homes are cool to see as well, so close together. We would suggest this hotel and trip in a heartbeat. It was fun!",20-Sep-09,4
"We booked this hotel through priceline. Several nights before, we stayed at the JW Marriott also booked through priceline. The Grand Hyatt was a disappointment after staying at the JW. The room smelled odd and the furnishings were very outdated. The bed was not very comfortable and the pillows were like rocks. This hotel was clean and in a good area so was fine, but we would not stay there again if we had a choice.",13-Sep-09,3
"When coming to San Francisco on vacation, Union Square is the place to be. The Grand Hyatt is less than one block from Union Square and I got a room for $80 on Priceline. The service was very good and we found the concierge to be very helpful. The rooms were nothing special unless you pay a premium to get a high floor. The top floor bar has incredible views.",11-Sep-09,4
"Stayed three nights over the Labor Day weekend. Booked through Priceline so got a terrific deal. Only three blocks from Bart/Muni, right on Union Square. Not much of a lobby but check-in was fast and friendly. Room is typical of older Hyatts, TV is old-school, furniture not the latest. However, there was plenty of space and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. Housekeepers were very nice and helpful. Bar on the top floor has fantastic views in all directions. Location will bring me back. Forget the Starbucks across the street, walk up Sutter a few blocks to Cafe Bean - 800 Sutter. Nice little coffee shop with good bagel sandwiches or a full breakfast.",9-Sep-09,4
"Booked through Hotwire. 2 nights as $230. No king size available, but they ""upgraded"" us to a Club room. (no difference from the non-Club room) Room was small, kind of dingy and smelled musty. Toiletries were substandard. All of these things were ok since the room had a great view of the city and the location is stellar........until the next day we noticed a stain on one of the beds - on the bottom sheet. After pulling it back, it seemed that someone, who stayed there previously, vomited on the bed, made it up and it was not checked by the maid. It soaked through the mattress and was disgusting. We reported to the front desk and they promptly changed us to a different room. Funny thing though, when we returned to the original room to gather our belongings, the room had been cleaned. we checked the bed and the maid had not changed the sheets! Even though we left the bed with only the bottom sheet on and the stain was exposed. Obviously, the housekeeping staff needs some updated training. The room we changed to was similar in size and amenities, but with a dirtier window. Aside from all of that, the staff was very courteous and the location cannot be beat. Will not return. Many hotels in this area and no need purchase off of hotwire again for this area.",7-Sep-09,3
"Just about to go to bed on our last night of three at the Grand Hyatt. This hotel is in the perfect location to experience San Franciso. There is nothing particularly amazing about the hotel, but nothing bad either. Lobby is nice, rooms are nice but small. The fitness centre is great. The concierge desk is very helpful especially with dinner reservations. If you want to splurge don't miss Fleur de Lys, well worth every penny. Would definitely come back.",6-Sep-09,4
"We stayed here for 5 nights in August. The hotel is well located just yards from Union Square and a steady 30 minute walk from Fisherman's Wharf.Although we were on a high floor, we were facing away from the Bay so the view wasn't great. The room itself was a good size for the three of us with 2 double beds. The furniture was looking a little tired around the edges and the vacuum cleaner had obviously struggled to reach the edges of the room. That said, the room was pleasant enough and the bathroom was clean and well fitted.I do find myself slightly irritated by the exhortation to re-use towels etc.The front desk staff were pleasant but I can't comment about the other facilities as we didn't use them.",4-Sep-09,4
"Choose the hotel as it was very near to where my meetings were to be held. Must say the service,staff and location were amazing. Very helpful staff always ready to arrange a cab and give directions. Have already made my next reservation for a conference i have to attend in October.",29-Aug-09,4
"We recently stayed at this hotel as part of a 3 week trip and at first the hotel is very impressive, lobby smart and the staff very helpfulValet parking was great but not cheap.Location is superb and you can get a tram back to within 300yds of the hotel.Views from the bar are fantastic and breakfast was plentiful, again staff were great.Only downside for us was the room - quite small and the bathroom could have done with a refit as it was starting to show its ageOverall very good hotel",28-Aug-09,4
"My family had a very nice 4 day stay to kick off our summer vacation. The location is terrific - near Union Square and Chinatown - and our rooms were very clean and comfortable - beds were so soft. The service, however, was not quite what I expected. In the last 30 minutes of our stay, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. When we were checking out, we called for a bellman to take our bags, and we asked that our car, which was parked in the hotel lot, be left for us. Twenty minutes later, someone from housekeeping arrived to deliver the rollaway bed that we had, according to him, just requested. I called the lobby to ask why we were incorrectly sent a rollaway instead of a bellman. The gentleman said ""I didn't send a bed to you! I didn't send anyone to you!"" I asked where the bellman was and he said he would find out and quickly hung up. The bellman finally showed, and when we arrived in the lobby, our car was nowhere to be found. My husband informed the parking attendant we had called for our car 30 minutes earlier, when we called for a bellman. The attendant told my husband that he never received the call so we'd just have to wait 30 minutes, as though we were just now requesting our car. I have to say we were pretty surprised with that answer. But we did receive our car a few minutes later and were able to leave.",27-Aug-09,4
"I was pleasantly surprised to get this hotel looking for a room on Priceline for a Saturday night in San Francisco. For the $77 bid, I stayed here for one night, Sat Aug 22. This was a great deal for the room that we were given. We arrived after dinner, and the staff were courteous and quick to find a good room for us. We had an upper level room with a good view of the Financial District and the TransAmerica building. The room was spacious, comfortable with quality linens. We did not have any coffee and associated sugar, cream and these were promptly attended to by the staff. In the morning, we had a good recommendation for breakfast and enjoyed walking around the Union Square area. We checked out and then spent the day on the cable car (right outside the door) to Fisherman's Wharf. It was very close to Chinatown as well. All in all a very good stay, for good value on the price paid. The only downside was expensive valet parking or expensive city parking across the street. Being a downtown location, this has to be expected. I would recommnd to others.",27-Aug-09,4
"Nice hotel in a good location. Like most Hyatts, the common areas are elegant, the rooms comfortable but nothing special. This hotel's rooms were smaller than those in other Hyatts - typical of most hotels in this area.I usually think Hyatt's restaurants are pricey but this one was over the top - $30 for a simple buffet breakfast. After that experience on the first morning, I didn't patronize the hotel restaurants. The Irish restaurant across the street was a much better choice - excellent food at reasonable prices. There's a 50's diner a few blocks away that was also very good.The concierge was great - very knowledgeable about the area and extremely helpful in arranging transportation. Had a few problems at checkout since they didn't separate the bills as I had requested upon checkin. Finally got things straightened out, but it took and hour and two levels of supervisors to get it done.",24-Aug-09,4
"The hotel was in a GREAT location, close to all the downtown shopping.but once we walked in the room was average. we stayed on the 32nd floor and had a great city view. but the tv was likely a 10 year old tv. The Bed was great.the bathroom was average, and had a small 5"" tv. that was long and likely from 1990.there is NO pool.. I just assumed a 4 star hotel would have a pool.the view from the 36th floor restaurant was amazing, but you could stay at motel 6 and come eat up here as well.the lobby is just average.I travel a bunch, and this would easily be a 3 star hotel.",22-Aug-09,3
"I must tell you I love Hyatt Hotels, and this is a rare thing to happen in the Hyatt. This is a very nice hotel in a very nice locations, only a stone throw from union square. My family checked in before me a few hours, it took them almost half an hour to check into 2 rooms. Despite being the only people checking in at 10pm. My family had 3 small children with them, you can imagine the scene, Rooms are no doubt very nice,Small, dated but clean. entertainment system is nice with ipod dock (very common now) upon checking out we were charged wrong for our rooms, we have booked a package from hyatt.com which includes a free 3rd night, but the staff says she has no idea how to put that in the system so she is going to charge it for all 3 nights. I had to literally print out my booking from the business center to show her my booking before she took it out of our bills. we have 3 rooms in the same package. If I did not notice this mistake we would have been charge for 3 extra nights at 280$ + services. How can you not know how to calculate the room rates. You are a front desk staff. I think you will be better off as a porter. 2 thumps up for the concierge staff, they knew the best places to eat in SF. Tips: Valet parking is very expensive, and the lot opposite the hotel is a cheaper place to self park.",17-Aug-09,3
"We stayed in the Execute Suite at the Grand Hyatt. We are a family of 5 with 3 teens, there was plenty of room.There is one king bed in one room, the second connecting room has a sofa bed, large dining table with 4 chairs. The bonus is there is 2 bathrooms. We also requested a rollaway plus a fridge, both of which were there upon check in. We were up on the 16th floor, great view, very quiet room. Ordered room service twice, prompt delivery, great food.The hotel is a little older so the bathrooms are a little dated, the rug was showing wear, but the hotel is very clean.I would definitely stay here again, very close to shopping, close to cable car line also.Make sure to visit Alcatraz and take the audio tour, book tickets well ahead of time. Also visit Fishermen's Wharf, and ride the cable cars too. Lots of fun.We also used the gym. Also used the computer in the lobby to print boarding passes. No soda machines or gift shop in this hotel. Bought snacks and drinks at Walgreens across the street.Starbucks is also across the street.",11-Aug-09,5
"I'm on the wall on this one. It certainly isn't up to the level of other Hyatt hotels.The noise levels were the main problem here both outside (thin windows) and in the hall outside. The bathrooms need abit of modernising, it's the first time I've seen wall paper in a 4* hotel bathroom in years.Having said that the rooms are clean and beds fine. Staff are pretty helpful and the location it spot on. If I had paid full price for my stay I would think it over priced but though priceline for $110 it was fine.",8-Aug-09,3
"The Grand Hyatt was expensive, of course you know that because it is directly in Union Square. We ended up booking directly through the hotel's own website and using our AAA card for a discount. Make sure you book their concierge level floors (31-36). These floors have better views as they are up higher, serve a pretty decent breakfast, and evening snacks and discounted alcohol. The breakfast had lox, bagels, fruits, and plenty of pastries. They even served Starbuck's and Seattle's Best Coffees. For afternoon snacks they had sushi one evening, and shrimp appetizers the next. The alcohol you can purchase is wine, beer, and a few hard liquors with juices for mixing. We had San Fran's local beer, Anchor Steam, which is pretty tasty ($3 a bottle). It's a lot cheaper then their bar on the 36th floor (which you should check out...go early for a table by the window). The Concierge level also has free wi-fi, you have to pay for it in your room!The Grand Hyatt has an awesome location right on Union Square...if you're coming to shop the extra cost to stay here is worth it! We didn't eat in their restaurants, so I cannot comment on those. But we did get special VIP treatment from the waiters in the Concierge level....they kept it open after hours and allowed us to watch the fireworks from the lounge! It was amazing...there were only about 10 of us in there, we each had a window seat with a nice comfy lounge chair. We got lucky and there was hardly any fog.Check-in and check-out were easy. There was a weird mini-bar charge (which was my fault since we moved stuff around in the fridge to put our own drinks in there)...but the girl at the front desk removed the charge with 1 phone call. Valet parking was quick and easy, of course you do pay a pretty penny for this service. Amenities in the room are nice, all the right touches. The shower was awesome, perfect water pressure. The pillows on the bed left something to be desired.You should stay here....it's worth the extra $$$!",5-Aug-09,4
"The Grand Hyatt is right in Union Square so you can't get a better location for sightseeing and shopping. The only problem is the hotel appears to be severely understaffed. I arrived at 9 pm on a Wednesday evening and there was only one front desk clerk. A large family was right in front checking in with lots of questions and issues. I had to wait 15 minutes for them to finish as I was next on line. I was shocked that they didn't have a second front desk clerk to help. Even the bellhops were uncomfortable with the amount of time it took. By the time I got to the front desk, there were 5 people behind me waiting and angry. Seems like they have problems staffing according to load. If a hotel is charging $350/night for a standard room on a busy weekday in this recesssion, one would think that they would at least have a second or third person on duty. Or train the bell staff to help out? Otherwise, the stay was great. I concur with the comments below that the rooms are comfortable and great views but the bathrooms need to be updated. I had a bathtub from the 70's with a shower that didn't quite work right. I LOVED my housekeeper, so friendly, so professional and went out of her way to help.",4-Aug-09,3
"Being a 'regular' Hyatt visitor I didn't think that this hotel lived up to previous Hyatt experiences. Lobby - Dark and dingyLifts - extremely slow. So slow that my husband and I walked down from the 9th floor as it was quicker and easier.Room - We had a double queen. The room itself was dark and quite depressing. The colors, brown and rust along with the dark wood furniture made the room feel smaller. We were four staying and we all felt as though we were on top of each other.Beds were very comfortable and quite large for queen bedsBreakfast - recommendable if only for the fantastic view over San Francisco!! Although we did use the Starbucks which is directly opposite.A couple of mornings we were a bit slow off the blocks (maybe 9ish) and had the maid constantly barging in asking when we will be leaving so she could clean!Bathroom - Brightly lit and clean. Shower was powerful and good. Towel's a plenty, large, very white and fluffy.Best thing is the location. Chinatown a very short walk away as was the tram and public transport to all the major tourist areas. Macy's and other large shops are within throwing distance.We hired the hotel car to take us to the airport which was very reasonably priced, quick and convenient.This hotel was at best average. I would say it needs a make over to brighten it up and make it more appealing. There was condensation on the window's and the air conditioning vent rattled a bit which was disturbing - although this was probably just our room.(Additional advice - If visiting san Francisco even in Summer, take plenty of jackets and sweaters - it was so cold!)",29-Jul-09,3
"I, my wife and my 15-year-old son stayed at Hyatt Hotel Grand SFO San Francisco from the 3rd of June to 6th June 2009.I chose this hotel because of its access and proximity to some of the important places in San Francisco.On the first night itself we started to hear knocking sounds on the door of the room and some people talking loudly. We had a disturbed night and my son whose bed was closer to the door was particularly disturbed.The next night again, the loud knocking from the door started and would happen after every half-hour to one hour.Unable to sleep, I called the reception at 5 a.m. in the morning and narrated these problems. I was told that the noise was perhaps because of the high winds and the fact that minor earthquakes keep occurring in San Francisco. I specifically asked if anybody else had reported similar problems that night as the problems with high winds could not be only for me and not for the others. I was told that nobody else had reported similar problems that might. However, I was promised an upgrade of room the next day. The next day I narrated my tale of woes in writing and give it to the reception. I was promised that by the evening my room would be changed and that I would be upgraded as compensation for the disturbance that I had to bear for two consecutive nights.However, in the evening I was told that there were no better rooms available and that I would have to shift to a room on the lower floor. I reluctantly agreed as I had no choice in the matter. I expressed my serious reservations at the manner to the hotel authorities who were attending to me. Late in the evening I received a call from the reception who stated that complementary the breakfast coupons were being sent to me and the same could be used the next day.The next day the three of us had breakfast which needless to add was very ordinary. We handed over the coupons to the attendant.We checked out to another hotel the next day and were expressly told at the reception that there were no dues outstanding against us.On receipt of my credit card statement after about 15 days I was surprised to find that USD 106 had been charged from me.I promptly called the accounts department of the hotel and asked them for the details of USD 106 charged from me. I was shocked to learn that they had charged me for the complimentary breakfast. I narrated that incident to the person who expressed her surprise that no such complaint etc was recorded in the computers of the hotel. I told her to look into this matter as there was something very wrong going on in the hotel. I havenâ€™t heard from the Hotel since then. I have never experienced such a casual and lackadaisical approach from the staff of a hotel in my life. It is as if they are not bothered about customer relations and their prime motive is to make money whichever way, out of whoever comes to the hotel.Needless to add that till date despite written complaints I do not have any form of apology from the hotel.Other than a reasonably good location, there is nothing at all in the hotel to be talked about.",27-Jul-09,1
"Stayed here for 4 nights as part of a Virgin package. We were in room 717. This was a spacious room for wheel chair users. It had a connecting door to the next room. The guests there had some friends back at 1.30am and were so loud it was as if they were in our room and went on till gone three. Very inconsiderate. The receptionist was not at all friendly when we arrived at 10pm. She didn't look at my Hyatt gold passport.We had a cocktail in the bar on the 36th floor. Tremendous views and not overpriced for drinks.The door men were really nice and friendly. The location is superb. We walked around a great deal, it took us about half an hour to get to fisherman's wharf.We had prebooked our Alcatraz trip which was good idea.It was fully booked four days in advance.Good shopping right outside the hotel and places to eat.Now something to watch. We gave our credit card when we checked in as we had to in all other hotels on the tour with no problems. We also gave in our voucher for the accommodation paid for by Virgin.When we came to check out there was a queue and we tried the automated machine in the lobby.It said we owed over$600. We knew we owed nothing so duly queued up and the man confirmed it was all paid for by Virgin.Imagine my suprise when I checked my credit card statement and saw I had been charged. I rang the hotel from England and spoke to a very helpful man in accounts called Bennie. He refunded the money but due to a change in exchange rates it has left us $20 out of pocket. Another international phonecall and they now want a copy of my bill so I am hoping eventually I may get this back. Be careful to check this doesn't happen to you.",23-Jul-09,3
"A lot of people seem to be disappointed with this property, but out of the Union Square hotels at which I've stayed the Grand Hyatt is by far my favorite.The rooms range from almost New York City compact to spacious, depending on the ability of you to stretch your budget, but even the regular guest rooms are quite comfortable. The beds are wonderful and the rooms surprisingly quiet for a city location.Unlike some high-rise hotels I've stayed at I've been impressed by the ability to easily get an elevator whenever I've stayed here - I've never had to wait more than a minute or two.I also highly recommend the Grandviews lounge atop the hotel. An excellent view at night, but the view is completely jaw-dropping during the day.The exercise room is also now open 24/7, a nice plus after a long day of meetings.The location on Union Square also can't be beat - the fact that it's set back a bit from the square keeps it a bit quieter than many other nearby properties.The TVs in the room are older CRT models, but with Union Square right outside the door, except in the morning who has time to watch TV?My only complaint would be the highly confiscatory daily rate for valet parking - higher than any other Union Square hotel as far as I can tell (though within $5/day of most other nearby properties.)",22-Jul-09,4
"Great Location, Average Room. We have stayed at this Hyatt twice - it is is fine if you get a good deal, but really needs to be updated. Staff is friendly and helpful.",9-Jul-09,3
"I recently booked reservations at the Grand Hyatt SF for one night, and I was very pleased with my stay. It was my girlfriend's birthday, and we decided to eat dinner in SF and celebrate her birthday at a club near by the hotel. I booked the Hyatt so that we can just walk back to the hotel and not worry about having to drive home after a night of drinking. I parked my car across the street, at the Union Square garage and it was $31 for the night. The hotel's parking would have been $50 per night.  Check-in and out was very fast and efficient, along with great customer service. The rooms had a modern decor, yet no flat screen TV. However, most importantly, the rooms were clean and spotless. In the morning, we went to the Starbucks, which is right across the street, and walked around Union Square. We even walked along Market St. because there was a gay parade going on. The location of the Grand Hyatt is an ideal location for anyone visiting San Francisco. If you stay at the Grand Hyatt SF, you will be steps away from shops, restaurants, and bars/clubs. Chinatown is a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel as well. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay and would recommend the Grand Hyatt to anyone coming to visit San Francisco.",1-Jul-09,5
"This Hyatt was not up to Hyatt standards. I had stayed here three years ago and was very pleased. Balcony doors no longer open (which is one of the reasons I chose to stay here again), carpet was stained, trash under the bed and the bathroom door was dirty. The second day I finally wiped the door down myself. In four days, with three people in the room we only received one water glass and since I accidently booked it for two people (although at check-in there were three of us and we were given three keys) so we only had towels for two. After our room had been serviced the second day I went to the front desk to mention no glasses and shortage of towels and she didn't want to be bothered, although we did receive more towels. She mentioned something about ""being green"". Well, I'm not sure three people sharing one glass for four days is my thought of ""being green"". I originally booked it for five nights and had to change it to four nights which caused the rate to go up?? I doubt I would stay here again and would probably opt for the Westin at Union Square.",26-Jun-09,2
"Love the location of this hotel. Throughly enjoyed are stay at the hotel. Ate at the ""Grandview ""breakfast and dinner were very expensive. The best view is in the Lounge not the restaurant. Price wise try the other restaurants on the area.Would definitely stay here again.",24-Jun-09,5
I have to admit that the location and view was perfect. But the overall experience was not. We made two reservations with them. One for a friday and saturday check-in but found out that we could make it over on thursday so we called to extend our stay or to get an earlier stay. Not only did they price us double the price we orginally got but also did understand the connection of having already booked a room for the next two nights. So instead I called priceline and booked a room for a much lower price. I have to admit I rather deal with priceline than direct service with Hyatt. Which says alot about Hyatt's overall customer service. But the bummer or reason for this low review is that after we left on Sunday they charged two charges on a debt card that was only used for the bar. This debt card was not used to hold the rooms nor were they given to the front desk. We called to ask about the charges and they say they could not help us. Only the accounting department could help. We asked them how was it possible not to be able to tell us what the charges were for. The lady on the line say its because they we a high end hotel therefore other departments took care of such things. Told us the accounting department will call us. They did not after two days! Only to reverse the charges 3 days later without a call or notice. I think this has to be the worst customer service I ever recieved from a hotel Econolodge even has better service. They charge for everything! No free internet/no free business center/ 45 dollars per day for parking. For 150 dollars a night you would think at least the internet was free.,23-Jun-09,1
"We found the hotel a great base for exploring San Francisco. The location is perfectly located, overlooking Union Square with great shopping and eating within a short distance. The rooms are smallish but comfortable and clean. The gym which my son and myself used every day is well equipped and well stocked with towels earphones etc. The only things I didnt like was the overpriced internet access and in-hotel restaurant. When will hotels like this learn that if they price their restaurants to compete with local establishments you will eat in their hotel and give them money. They just dont seem to get it. Internet in this day should be free not a reason to rip people off. A tip: The Cheesecake factory is a great well priced but very, very popular restaurant located on the top floor of Macy's just across Union Square. They dont take bookings and waiting time can be an hour plus. If you talk to the concierge they can actually make a booking for you that gives you a priority. We used it twice and only had to wait 5-10 mins both times. Great food",19-Jun-09,4
"Excellent location in downtown SF, overlooking Union Square. The lobby had a modern feel to it and the rooms was large and comfortable. The view from my room (on the 22nd floor) was stunning. The service (especially the concierge) was great. All of this was for a price of about $125 a night, which was very low given the location (at least one other hotel in the area was asking for twice that).",14-Jun-09,5
"This hotel has a great lobby and is in an unbelievable location. The rooms are a bit dated for such a grand hotel, no flat screens, dated bathroom etc but it is a 3.5 star hotel for sure.The location is great as it is right on Union Square and walking distance to china town and the trolleys, I talked to the wharf and it was not difficult.The 36th floor bar has awesome views that really blow your mind, drinks are pricey as one would expect.",10-Jun-09,4
This is one of the best hotels to stay during the Oracle Open World. Walking distance from the Muscone Center and has lots of shopping & dining options near it.,7-Jun-09,5
Great room with friendly staff. Posh roomy room. AND I got it for $65 a night!,6-Jun-09,5
"Brilliant location, litereally on Union Square (borders it). The underground station and tram lines were about 2 mins away (2-3 blocks). The famous cable car was also 1 block away.The hotel itself was clean, good room, clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. We did not use the hotel bar or restaurant but did visit the main one, which is on the 36th (top) floor which had great views of the city.",6-Jun-09,4
"We checked out of the Grand Hyatt yesterday and couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were traveling with children and asked the concierge for a kid friendly Italian restaurant. She recommended Uncle Vito's which was unbelievably inexpensive and wonderful, only two blocks away and was the best meal of the trip. Our room was on the 22nd floor overlooking Union Square - and of course the bay views behind the city. The linens were excellent and of typical Hyatt quality. Our bathroom was marble and my only complaint was that the tub was small but that's to be expected of a hotel this age. The amenities were excellent.The views from the 36th floor lounge and restaurant were 360 degrees and incomparable! I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially since we got it on Priceline for $80, what a bargain!",4-Jun-09,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 3 nights during the middle of May. Nice lobby, clean rooms, comfortable beds, big bathroom with a good shower. The AC/heat was individually controlled with a digital thermostat and worked well. Our room was very quiet, was cleaned daily and restocked with towels while we were out during the day. The hotel is right in Union Square with easy access to mass transit and lots of shopping and places to eat nearby. No complaints!",1-Jun-09,5
"This hotel is in a superb location in San Francisco. One to two blocks from Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman-Marcus, Macy's and many more designer stores. A couple more blocks away is Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom (Westfield Shopping Centre). BART station (Powell) is also in walking distance, as this was my mode of transportation from SFO. Room was on 16th floor and was very clean and comfortable. Large Bathroom. A this might not be a big deal, but I like a hotel that provides an in-room coffeemaker, which this Hyatt provided! Lobby personnel were very friendly too!",30-May-09,4
"We stayed in the Gran Hyatt for four nights last week. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was not pleased with the check-in service. We had to wait 15 minutes to be waited on, then we were told to hold on a minute while the clerk answered the phone. They need a few more clerks for the crowd. Although clean and simple the lobby is pretty boring. There isn't anything but the check-in desk and the elevators. One upstairs, we were very pleased with our room. the room and the bathroom were spacious, comfortable and clean. The best part was the view. We were on the 25th floor and had an amazing view of the bay, Coit tower and Alcatrez. Couldn't have asked for a better room. The bar and restaurant on the top floor offered an amazing view. We had a drink, but couldn't afford anything to eat ;-) There is not free internet in the rooms, or in the business center. It is $5 for 15 mins. The hotel was in an amazing location, right in the middle of Union Square, shopping mecca! Any name brand department store and designer you are looking for is right around the corner.",29-May-09,4
"As my first time in a Grand Hyatt hotel I was expecting something more luxury. The rooms are ok with a good and big bed but that's all. What makes this hotel a good option in San Francisco is its location, close to Union Square and its stores and restaurants.",28-May-09,4
"We booked one night at the Hyatt and were quoted a rate of $167 just from walking in off the street - this was much cheaper than other hotels in the area.Room was huge, with brilliant views of Union Square. I'm sure that any room from a reasonable floor upwards would have good views regardless of which way it's facing.The restaurant and bar on the 36th floor had great views of the city - worth going there even for just a drink in the bar - and they are children-friendly.",26-May-09,5
"Three of us stayed at the Grand Hyatt near Union Square in San Francisco on Memorial Day. I reserved the room through Priceline on a name your own price offer. We couldn't have been happier.The check-in process was very easy. We arrived at 11 am and the front desk attendant was happy to check us in early and accomodated my request for 2 double beds. The rooms were very nice. Not the most modern rooms, but clean and inviting and our 17th floor room had a great view. The rooms do have some minor wear and tear, but that is to be expected. The bathroom was great, and the beds were fantastic.The best part to me was the great location. We were one block from the cable car line and 3 blocks from the Powell Street BART line. We flew in and out of Oakland, so the BART was a great way for us to get to and from the hotel. The Pier's are only a 15 minute cable car ride away.The concierge desk was especially helpful. We utilized them twice. On the second occasion, my wife wanted a very specific desert, and the concierge went above and beyond to find us what we were looking for.The parking is pricey, so we turned in our rental car (we had spent part of the weekend in Sacramento) and used the public transit. I would not recommend a rental car if staying at this hotel. You can buy 1 day, 3 day, and weekl long passes for the public transit and you can get everywhere you need to go.For some tourists looking for a place to sleep and shower, this hotel was perfect. It was great.",26-May-09,5
"Hotel was clean, in a good location (can walk to chinatown and union square). Cabs to the waterfront are probably needed(lots of hills). Its a few blocks to the convention center but walkable. The hotel bar on the top floor is great (but pricey) but one of the best views of the city.",23-May-09,5
"I last stayed at this hotel in 2004 and at the time remembered being impressed by the location. Well the location has not changed but apparently neither has anything else in the hotel. While the hotel was clean, overall it has a worn appearance and is in need of renovation. As one reviewer noted this is more like a three star hotel than five star. The carpets are worn as are the rooms, I expected a little more from a Hyatt. The fact that they wanted to charge an outrageous sum for wifi access did not help. Will probably go elsewhere next time.",23-May-09,3
"We booked two rooms through priceline.com and got a good rate under a hundred dollars. When the other guest was not able to arrive until two days into the reservation i spoke with a Hyatt representative to make sure his room would not be canceled, understanding that we would still be paying for the unused nights. Again upon checking in i confirmed that the second room was still being held for his late arrival.Sure enough, when he arrived he was informed that his room had been canceled. The staff acknowledged that there was a note on the reservation saying to make sure it was not canceled, but nonetheless said there was nothing they could do. The front desk staff was rude and not at all helpful. It was embarrassing for me, and certainly for the hotel.This is a mediocre hotel, not a dump certainly, but there are many more comfortable hotels in the same part of town which are cheaper, and will undoubtedly treat you better.Needless to say, we will never stay in this hotel again, not in a city liek San Francisco with so many more civilized options.",20-May-09,1
"The hotel itself is just average. Nothing special to mention. We got our room on Priceline.com, so we really didn't have any major complaints. It was a deeply discounted rate. It was clean, but I would not rate it a 4 star. It's more of a 3 star hotel with 5 star location. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our biggest concern was parking. If you are on a budget, they charge $50 plus tax for parking. This I have to say is the biggest rip off, especially when you can park just across the street at the Sutter/Stockton parking structure for much less, depending on when you enter and when you leave. Keep in mind that there's no in/out privileges. Our first night's parking was $17 and second night's was $15. Big difference versus $50 a night. Save your money and park your car yourself. If you want in/out privileges, there's another structure on Sutter for $35 for a 24 hour period. If you are not looking for the little extras, you will find this hotel to be good.",14-May-09,3
"The hotel was typically upmarket chain. Efficient service but not over friendly, comfortable but not luxury. However the location was brilliant, right in the heart of the city on Union Sq and its well worth a recomendation for that. Not a million miles from the Powel St Bart station so no need to get an airport taxi if you are travelling light",5-May-09,3
"Check in was easy, very helpful front desk. Nice, clean rooms with beautiful views of the city. Good size and nice bathroom with all the essentials. Check out was easy via telephone. I'm looking forward to staying here, again.",20-Apr-09,5
"First of all, be aware that this hotel does not have parking. In fact, you have two choices: valet ($45/night) or public parking ($35/night). I wish I had known this before booking. With that said, the hotel itself was very clean, amenities felt new, and the staff was superb! From the moment we arrived, the staff was super helpful and cordial from the bell man to the restaurant staff. We had dinner at the Grandview Restaurant on the 36th floor, and felt pampered by the service (even though we had a very messy 10-month-old with us). The next morning, they let me stop by their buffet and pick up some pastries to bring up to the my room (for a very reasonable price). The staff even went out of their way to help me with my baby and stroller.The location was excellent... just a block away from Macy's and in the center of Union Square. I'm glad the hotel was kid-friendly after all. Downside - Wifi was $9.99, and of course lack of parking. Overall, I felt like everything was clean in the room, had a decent view (and we were only on the 5th floor), and didn't have any problems.",13-Apr-09,4
"We were a little worried after reading some of the reviews. So here is the truth from an unbiased couple. The location is awesome. The rooms are fine. They are nice and not ""outdated"" or anything else, although we did not see them as worthy of a $200 price tag, if you pay the regular price. Our $89 Priceline rate seemed like a really good deal. The staff was wonderful and very accomodating. Everything was great... except the clicking! Wow, if you are a light sleeper, it will drive you nuts. The staff said it happens when the wind blows and is worse the higher you go. Something about the hotel moving and earthquake safety. It sure was loud though. So we gave up our view on the 10th floor and moved to the 4th. It was much better and we were not in the room much anyway. If you want the view, head to the restaurant.",4-Apr-09,3
"My mom and I booked the Grand Hyatt because it was centrally located in Union Square. We had awesome help from the conceige before we arrived (transportation to/from SFO, around the city, etc) Check-in was a breeze once we got there. Our room over looked Union Square on the 31st floor. We caught the Culture Bus to California Academy of Sciences (GG Park) a block away and were dropped off even closer to the Grand Hyatt. I would recommend to anyone that wants a hotel in easy access to everything. Cable cars were a block away on Powell (didn't ride them in this trip, but I love them). The view from the Grandviews lounge on the 36th floor is to die for (We caught it on an afternoon where it had rained the night before and you could see the Bridges (GG and Bay), Alactraz, and Transamerica building)",23-Mar-09,5
"This hotel has attentive and welcoming staff from the moment you step off the pavement. Check-in, bell boys and concierge staff are welcoming and friendly and one of the strengths of this hotel.The other is the superb location just off the corner of Union Square. As such, the rooms (27th floor) and bar have superb views of Powell Street or of San Francisco. The bar also serves great cheese cake. Nearby you are also served with plenty of Starbucks and Walgreens.The room: I can understand criticism of them being dated or noisy with wind but they are decent rooms of good size, clean, and the noise is not that loud you become troubled by it. Concierge recommended a great Chinese restaurant ( Hunan Homes) that was a real gift of a find. There is also a great meal and good service to be found at nearby Scala's Bistro. Best breakfasts have to be at Sears...an American Institution. All of these are a short walk from the hotel.There is no doubt in my mind that the Grand Hyatt would be my first port of call for the next visit to San Francisco.",1-Mar-09,4
"I stayed with two friends of mine at the Grand Hyatt for one night. One of my friend is a part of the ""gold membership"" or something, so we stayed on a private floor and got access to the private lounge. The lounge served Starbucks coffee and provided snacks throughout the day. In the evening they provided reasonably-priced drinks and free desserts. The mood of the lounge was relaxing, and the waiter they had working there was friendly. The rooms themselves were clean and had a breathtaking view. The location was wonderful, and the night we stayed it was raining so the hotel lent us these humongous umbrellas. Overall the stay was nice, and I would stay there again.",28-Feb-09,4
"We got a great deal on this hotel on Priceline for 3 nights in mid February 2009. The location is awesome and you can walk everywhere in Union Square. When we checked in, they were extremely helpful and polite, which isn't always the case when they see you paid a lower rate for their rooms. I even asked how booked they were to see if we could have a room with a view. They happily obliged and gave us a room on the 25th floor facing Powell Street. Actually, the Starlight Room was directly across from us so it was kinda fun watching the parties over there from our window. The room was spacious, quiet, bed was comfy, staff was polite. I couldn't ask for much more than that for the great rate we got. We would definitely stay here again when in SF.",26-Feb-09,4
"We just got back from a 5 day getaway to San Francisco and we stayed at the Grand Hyatt. The location is the truly grand part of this hotel. You can't ask for a better situated hotel especially if you like to shop! The hotel itself is very dated and in need of some major work. Our room was on the 29th floor and we had a great view. The bed itself was very comfortable but the linens were worn and the towels in the bathroom were rather threadbare. The bathroom was dated and unless you ""plugged"" the bathroom sink you could smell sewer! Also it was rather windy for a few of the days and the creaking noise in our room kept us up at night and when we called to ask what was going on, since the first 2 nights were nice and quiet, we were told that the creaking was caused by the wind and the building was moving slightly and there was nothing we could do!!! Not really what you want to hear when you are on the 29th floor! The windows were filthy and had childrens hand prints all the way down the lower half! The furniture was old and grubby. Wallpaper was starting to peel off!The bar on the 36th floor provided a great view but the drinks were very expensive.The staff were helpful and the best part of the hotel.There are many other hotels in the area I would check out before ever going back to the Grand Hyatt.",18-Feb-09,3
"My wife and I chose the relative ""safety"" of the Hyatt brand for a long weekend anniversary trip to San Francisco recently. As a frequent business traveller, I've stayed at Grand Hyatts all over the country and have always been satisfied (a corner room in the amazing Grand Hyatt Seattle ranks as one of the finest hotel experiences we've ever had). Cons: Small, cramped lobby sports a1980's brass and mirror motif with ugly tile and does not make a good impression. There is no store/gift shop on site and no soda machines on the floors. You could go to the Walgreen's down the street for beverages, but your fridge is already stocked with $5.30 soft drinks. The planned 2009 room renovation cannot come soon enough for this tired, dated property. Saw pictures of two renovated rooms online but they were booked. Our small room was clean but shabby, with faded, ripped carpet along the window ruining an otherwise impressive city view. The tub/shower combo was old and grubby and the cold-war era shower head and faucet literally dribbled water. As previous reviewers have noted, the 18"" TV is as lame as the beat-up armiore that encloses it. Our walls were thin and we could hear the idiots next door with perfect clarity. On the plus side, the service was crisp, with friendly bellman and a helpful concierge. The new mattresses are excellent. There is no beating this location- right on Union Square, steps from the cable cars. I paid with points, which took some of the sting away. But we could've stayed anywhere in SF for our special occasion and this was a let down. Hyatt is wasting a golden opportunity to shine in this location.",8-Feb-09,2
"The hotel is in a great location and what you would expect from a 4 star chain hotel. Its big, its efficient and generally well run. Staff were also very friendly and helpful. A typically expensive bar - but an amazing view from the top of this building and well worth a look. Rooms were good - again, basically what you would expect from a 4 star chain hotel! Although the windows were so dirty it was hard to admire the view! Made an international call from my room; it was almost $100 for a few minutes to the UK....will not make the same mistake again!Overall, what you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. I still would recommend smaller boutique hotels in SF - better quality and better value for money.",29-Jan-09,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco for 2 nights during our overseas trip. It is in a fantastic location adjacent to Union Square, shopping, restaurants and in close proximity to BART, Muni and cable cars.We finally arrived at the hotel at 3:30 am, exhausted after a delayed flight from Chicago. We were especially annoyed by the fact that the airline we flew with had left our luggage in Chicago. The lovely girl at check in accommodated us in the best way she could and asked for 2 hospitality kits (small bags with supplies such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, dental floss, mouthwash, razors, etc) to be sent up to our room. This was an absolute lifesaver.Our room was situated on a high floor with a beautiful view over Union Square. I must admit the room was a little dated, but it was attractive, spotlessly clean and very spacious. My only complaint would have to be the desk, which was more of a small table than a working desk. The bed was extremely comfortable and was just the thing I needed after spending most of the day in the air. The bathroom was a good size and clad with marble tiles however it would benefit from some modernisation as it seemed a little tired. The hotel gave us a good range of amenities in the bathroom as well as coffee and tea making facilities in the room.The following day after telling the concierge about the situation with our luggage, she took it upon herself to ring the airline and chase them up. She wasnâ€™t able to get through to the baggage department right away, but she reassured us she would keep trying and do the best she could. We were impressed with her courtesy and professionalism. In the meantime, she organised a city tour for us which was fantastic as were only in San Francisco for the day and were able to see most of the city.When we returned to the hotel the concierge informed us that our bags were on their way. They arrived about an hour later which was a huge relief! If it hadnâ€™t been for her we probably wouldnâ€™t have gotten them back so quickly and as we were pressed for time, would have had to leave San Francisco without them! We were very grateful for her service.Overall our experience at the Grand Hyatt was great. The service was great, the room was comfortable and the location was perfect. My only one real complaint with this property would be that room service finishes at midnight (strange for a Grand Hyatt) and this was annoying as we would have loved to order some on our first night as we were starving. Besides that, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone planning a visit to San Francisco.",28-Jan-09,4
"The dawn of the 21st century seems to have escaped this Hyatt. Beyond a very comfy bed, nice linens, and an iPod dock, the rooms are still living in the 70s and 80s. The lighting, vanity, and peach-colored tile in the bathroom scream 70s, and the traditional wood furniture is hopelessly outdated. As for technology, there is no real desk (just a table in the corner), no desk chair, only a couple of outlets near the ""desk,"" wifi costs $10/day, and when I'm staying at the ""Grand"" Hyatt I really don't want to be watching the same 18-year-old tv I have at home. (In fact, it was the same TV that was in a friend's room in one of the cheap old hotels on Post St.) The carpet was very unattractive and there seemed to be no consistent theme to the artwork. The room was not that much cheaper than some others I considered that I know are more up to date, and for the location and clientele, this hotel really needs to step it up.It was immaculately clean and the staff was friendly and the service good, the lobby is pretty and the 36th floor lounge was nice enough. But overall, I was extremely disappointed.",25-Jan-09,3
"The hotel has a great location just north of Union Square, with easy access to shops, a nearby Walgreens pharmacy, cable cars, Muni and BART. My 8th floor room was clean but smaller than expected and faced east at another building. Rooms facing south have a nice view of the square (with lots of sun). The lobby is not a conducive space for meeting people. Without a doubt, the highlight of this hotel is the stunning view from the rooftop lounge and restaurant. It's well worth a stop for a drink or breakfast - service was excellent. You don't have to eat there to enjoy the east-facing view.",24-Jan-09,4
"It's a Hyatt, so you know what to expect. The service is going to be good, etc. The room was a little less than what I expected. There was no desk to work at, though I made do with a table that was there. The concierge floors give you access to a lounge for breakfast and appetizers, etc. throughout the day. The gym is pretty good. Most Hyatts have huge lobbies that make for nice meeting spots. That's not the case here. The only place like that is the bar/restaurant on the top floor. It's a nice restaurant with a real nice view.",22-Jan-09,4
"My boyfriend and I stayed here Thanksgiving night. We had dinner at Michael Mina, an overpriced restaurant at Westin St. Francis. Our 15th floor room at the Grand Hyatt had a view of Union Square. We could see the holiday lights and decorations, as well as the ice skaters in the Square. The room was a little crowded because of the two double beds (error I made while booking). There was no nightstand on the outer edges of the two beds. The bathroom was fine, though I was surprised there was no shower gel provided. Instead they had toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, bar soaps, and lotion. The fluorescent bathroom light hummed annoyingly.Another bad thing--coffeemaker in the bathroom does not come with coffee. You have to PURCHASE the coffee from the in-room Refreshment Center. Lame. There is a Starbucks across from the hotel, though.We skipped valet parking and instead left the car in the Sutter-Stockton garage, which is diagonally across from the hotel at the corner of Sutter and Stockton. Much cheaper.In the morning I appreciated the free SF Chronicle outside our door. I like it better than USA Today.We live locally, so when we can get away from work, we sometimes come to SF because it's only about 45 minutes away. If you stay in Union Square, there's always something to do. It's less arduous than going all the way to wine country or the Monterey area when you have just one day off.",7-Dec-08,4
"Every time i went out and back to the hotel, or when popping up to the gym, i had to endure long waiting times for the elevators. There are so many elevators but they always seem to be elsewhere. I stayed there for business and when i returned in the evenings after meetings, that seemed to be peak hours and there's a constant sizeable crowd waiting in the foyer.",5-Dec-08,3
"This hotel is in a great location and the staff was extremely friendly. My wife, daughter and I spent two wonderfuul nights over Thanksgiving. The Thanksgiving buffet was great and the view from our table was spectacular. I do hope the hotel gets a much needed renovation soon but I fear that in this economy, it will not.The CONDITION,not cleanliness, but CONDITION of the hotel kept me from giving 5 Dots. It is definitely clean but needs to be refurbished.",30-Nov-08,4
"This htel was impressive from the outset. We arrived in our Town Car and greeted by the doorman who took our cases, and we quickly wandered to the reception desk to check in. This was a bit of a pain, as we booked a twin room and were told by the receptionist thatdespite us booking the hotel 12 months ago, they didn't have our room available, but they did have a double for the first night, and then we could move the next day. We agreed to take the double on the basis we could keep it for the duration of our stay as I really didn't travel 11hrs across the atlantic to swap rooms after one night!!Our room overlooked nothing impressive, which was a shame, but we got all the views that we needed from the restaraunt on the top floor, the food was expensive, but not brilliant, but the views were to die for, especially as we got there in time to catch sunset!!You can't fault the location of the hotel. Smack in the heart of Union Square, all the shops and convenience stores are right on your doorstep, out throught the foyer to the end of the block, take a left and forward two blocks and there's Walmart, out of the foyer and to the right and you have Macy's, Virgin Megstore, Louis Vitton ... the list goes on. It's between $7 and $15 to Fisherman's Wharf (depending on the time of day) for Pier 39 and Alcatraz cruise boarding, and I would recommend that if you're in a rush to get somewhere in the evening you try to get a taxi a good half hour before you need to be there as they become hard to come by the later the night gets. I would recommend that you research your stay, we sayed the same time as 'Team in Training', and to say that they took over the hotel is an understatement. And they impacted on everything, including creating a 30 min wait forthe lift (even though there was 5 of them!!). That said, the room was really cozy, bed comfortable, staff were amazingly friendly and it really was everything you could ask for in a hotel. By the time our 5 days were up and it was time to get our connection to LA, I was genuinely gutted to be leaving here, it felt like a home from home.If I were to go back to San Francisco, I would 100% stay at this hotel again.",27-Nov-08,5
"Having read mixed reviews on Trip Advisor we were a bit unsure about staying at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights in September but from the moment we arrived our worries disappeared.The hotel is in a great location just off Union Square, and stops for trams and streetcars are just a few minutes walk away. We booked a Regency Club King which was on a high floor and had excellent views of the financial district. The room was a bit smaller than expected, but the bed was extremely comfortable and the facilites were fine. Having access to the Regency Club Lounge was great. The views from there were even better than from our room - you could see the Financial District, Union Square, Coit Tower and the Bay. We enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast each morning and appetisers each evening. All soft drinks, tea and coffee were also free, only alcoholic drinks had to be paid for and given that it was a hotel, prices were reasonable. The staff in the lounge were welcoming and friendly.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and did all the usual touristy things, our particular favourites were biking the bridge with Blazing Saddles (we went as far as Sausalito), visiting Alcatraz and drinking lots of excellent champagne at Domaine Chandon during our day trip to Sonoma and Napa. We also enjoyed a delicous steak dinner in classy surroundings at Alfred's Steakhouse.",19-Nov-08,4
"I stayed here for 3 nights in November, it was an OK hotel at best.The rooms were very small, mine didn't have a desk. There was no sundries store (you had to walk to a nearby Walgreens), the mini-bar was one of those that charges you instantly if you remove something, so if you want to read a bottle of vitamin water, you get charged, the TV was mediocre, the phone didn't work, and there was no wired Internet connection. Internet services is $9.95 a night (via tMobile). Room service menu is very very limited.The best thing about the hotel is the location in the heart of union square, about 5 blocks from Moscone. The sky bar is pretty nice as well, but next time I'll stay at the Hilton.",13-Nov-08,3
"Stayed at the Hyatt near Union Square last weekend and it was not a stellar experience, but there was no real hang ups either. The room I got was right across from the vending machines, so the noise was a factor, and my room was quite small. It seemed more like a european size to me. However the room was well appointed, and besides the tiny black and white TV in the bathroom, the room was fine. It does seem a bit dated with no flat screens and a b&w!The bed was fantastic and the bar on the top floor was great with wonderful city views. One thing that did seem excessive was the valet parking fee, which was over $60 but I guess that is the price you pay for staying in Union Square.",10-Nov-08,4
"My stay here was nothing short of perfect. I was here for a business trip, and the company sprang for a corner room on one of the upper floors, giving me a gorgeous view of Union Square and the rest of San Francisco. The bed was the perfect blend of firm mattress and soft sheets, the bathroom was huge, and I got a copy of the San Francisco Chronicle every morning. The staff here is amazing...everyone always has a smile on, and there's always at least five people waiting to help you with your bags, opening the door, or getting you transportation. This place even has a gym, so I didn't have to hike to the nearest 24-hour Fitness on Montgomery. Only thing was that the internet was $10 a day, but I found that having to pay for internet is the norm among SF hotels. If I could afford this place, I'd definitely stay here when I'm in town for fun.",30-Oct-08,5
"we spent 5 nights in this hotel and were very disappointed. With all the hype of the reception lobby we expected more in our room. The furniture was very dated and worn, the shower curtain had mould half way up and the windows were so dirty that you could hardly see out of them. As this was our first trip to the US we were really looking forward to 1st class treatment but as tourists we felt as though we were lower class. The restaurant was nothing special and very expensive. There was a folder in our room with examples of the menu but when we went for a meal nothing that was in the folder was on offer. We left our video camera for about 1/2 hour while we went shopping and when we came back someone had wiped it but the hotel is believing staff rather than us.",14-Oct-08,2
"This was my first visit to San Francisco - Both Hyatt's Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf hotels had been recommended to us. We chose the Grand Hyatt on Union Square.The welcome at the hotel was very friendly and extremely informative. The lady on reception (apologies for not remembering her name) was very helpful with informing us with what was on in the city during our stay.The hotel room was basic but very clean and comfortable. It was noticeably catered for the business traveller.The location of the hotel is perfect for those who like to be in the middle of everything and like to shop and eat out. It is also ideally located for getting around the city as the trams system junction is 2 mins walk through the Square. You can get a tram to anywhere throughout the city from here. There is also a rail link to the airport minutes walk from the hotel. It takes on average 20 - 30 mins to walk from the Grand Hyatt down to Fisherman's Wharf, we did this every evening, which did make us think that we had made the wrong choice in hotel. However, the Hyatt at the wharf is only 3 stories high, so you are likely to be kept awake with noise from the street (if you are light sleeper like me) There is lots to see and do down at the Wharf - We also ""biked the bridge"" this was definitely the best part of our stay in San Francisco, the cycle up to Tiburon via Sausalito was great!.. both places are great places to stop for a great meal and a refreshing drink enjoying the scenery across the bay to the city. I highly recommend doing this on your visit.Alcatraz was a great as expected, very cold tho, even mid summer, so wrap up warm.Our stay in San Francisco was short but adequate. 4 days was enough to see everything we wanted to see and do.",9-Oct-08,4
"Stayed here for a 49rs game. Room was clean but like some other reviews hot water was luke warm at best, room also a bit noisy from weekend functions being held at plaza in the rear of hotel . I was on the 4th floor overlooking the bay and view was magnificant. Atrium was not very attractive just plane and dark. Everything here is very expensive, parking, food, drinks. Hyatt prices. Anyway good location, trolley station and public transportation within feet of hotel. Chinatown and fisherman warf a good 15-20 min walk. I paid $200 a night group rate.",8-Oct-08,3
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square with my sister for a fabulous weekend 9/25/08-9/29/08. It is conveniently located close to Union Square shopping, the Mason St cable cars and the streetcars on Market down to the wharf. The hotel was very nice. The accomodations were clean and comfortable. There was individual air/heat control in the room-not one of those awful noisy wall units. The concierges were amazing. They knew the best ways to get around. They recommended a wonderful Hop-on/Hop-off tour of the city with the tickets good for two days at a very reasonable price. They recommended a fabulous little Italian restaurant ""Fino"" about 2 blocks walk away and made the reservations for us. They had an appropriate solution to any question or challenge we presented them. They went above and beyond the call of duty in all things. The staff in the breakfast area were very accomodating also and made sure our needs were met in a timely manner. Housekeeping was superb-when asked to bring an extra towel, they were there within 10 minutes. I would certainly stay in this wonderful hotel with this fabulous staff again. As a matter of fact, I am trying to talk my husband into a trip there next year. The beds are comfortable with down comforters and plenty of pillows for all tastes.We were hesitant based on some of the previous reviews. Once we realized that some of these reviews were 3 to 4 years old and when we saw the hotel and the quality of the service, we were sure we made the right choice.",5-Oct-08,5
"Both my husband and I are hyatt platinum gold passport customers...1) check in - we had requested king room were given to small doubles (on honeymoon) - then moved to a higher floor with two small doubles...3rd time lucky moved to a king room.Which was gloomy, the bathrooms are awful the showers barely warm and drip water - no force.Sound proofing terrible.rooms in need of modernisation and the tvs are very 80's.2) Expensive - how at these prices internet access and PC is not free is ridiculous - any business service very expensive unreasonably so.3) Breakfast - buffet not worth it they serve concentrated juices and not fresh and only 3 hot items - two meat and eggs so if your a veggie you only get continental.Better value at the diners across the road.4) Location is great, views from 36th floor nice go for a drink in the bar around sunset.5) stay in one of the very many other choices you can have in this area.I will not be coming back - we stayed 10 days and its only the staff that made it a pleasure.",3-Oct-08,1
"The hotel was close to China town. We were in town when the Chinatown Fest and the Chocolate Fest were going on. The beds are so so, but the rooms are clean.The concierge was not very knowledgable about what was going on in the area. He did not even know about the Chinatown Fest which was two - three blocks away. He also did not know about the Chocolate Fest at Ghiardelle's.",30-Sep-08,3
"I stayed here on business one night and I am glad it was only one night..Upon check in I wanted a high bay view room with a king bed per my reservation. Instead I was given a room with a view of the city streets (along with two double beds). The windows were dirty too. I know it is pretty loud in downtown SF, but the soundproofing in my room could have been better.I didn't think this hotel was anything special. I would stay somewhere else if I were in the area again.",29-Sep-08,3
"I was extremely disappointed with my stay here, so much so that I left after one night. I paid for the Regency Club level, which is a Concierge Suite that used to be the rotating restaurant at the top. The food in the suite was not plentiful, not especially tasty and definitely not filling. Much better at the Marriott and the Hilton.Although my room had some nice design elements (t.v. IN the bathroom mirror, lovely shower stall), there were far more detriments:- I asked for a quiet room. Noise from Market street even up on the 16th floor kept me awake, especially a thumping bass from who knows where.- I love a dark hotel room, but the phone on the desk had such a short line that I couldn't see any of the labels, couldn't move it close enough to a light.- Bedding was new and very stylish, but the bed was saggy. No bedbugs or signs of them, which is good.- Water pressure was weak and the shower wouldn't get hotter than lukewarm.- Main t..v. installed so that if you move the t.v. in the slightest, it unplugs itself. Cranky maintenance guy says he gets 10 calls a night. Plus they ""fixed"" the t.v. so that you can't pull it all the way out for comfortable t.v. viewing AND several of the major stations had lots of snow and white lines (how do you even do that with cable?).- I phoned for help when I couldn't find the concierge lounge (it had moved since my last stay there). Help was very unhelpful, treated me like I was an interloper when a simple instruction would have saved us all a lot of bother. Like most of San Francisco, customer service at the Hyatt is generally bad. SF Financial District Hilton much better at this.- As I had a prepaid visit via hyatt.com, I asked the front desk if I could leave a day early and still get my money back. They made me call reservations line, who told me it was up to the front desk. I called the front desk back, and he refused to believe he was wrong, and when I said ""but if you won't give me my money back and reservations won't give me my money back, who will? he said only that ""someone will."" I'm anticipating having to go through my credit card company to get my $300+ dollars back.- Back when they filmed some interiors of High Anxiety, they had REAL plants hanging down the lovely interior cascade walls. Now they have a few fake plants, and it looks awful. - Ventilation/air conditioning is weird--at 6am I got someone cheap cologn/deodorant smell pumped into my room. What the?I work across the street from this hotel, but even in another work emergency, will pay whatever it takes to stay anywhere else. It clearly suffers from maintenance neglect, and slapping a little lipstick (fashionable bedding and furniture) on this won't make it a five star hotel. Inferior by far to the Financial District Hilton or even its sister hotel the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego.",28-Sep-08,1
"We found this to be the standard (nice) big city hotel with all the expected amenities. Standard additional charges too, for internet, telephone, etc. etc. etc. Our room on the 17th floor was clean, nicely furnished and adequate in all respects, particularly at the price point we got from Priceline Negotiator ($117+tax = just under $142 for a Saturday night). The hotel is very close to Union Square, but if youâ€™re a walker itâ€™s still within striking distance of the waterfront and most other parts of downtown. Didnâ€™t try the restaurant, but the sunset view from the lounge on the 36th floor is definitely worthwhile.Be sure to plan your budget to include parking if youâ€™ll need it. Expect the bums-rush in front of the hotel when you arrive, unless you'll accept valet parking at $49.50/day. Donâ€™t be cowed though - You can offload your bags in front and then self-park in the exact same garage kitty corner across Stockton from the hotel for about $26/day!",27-Sep-08,4
"GREAT STAFF BUT...as a Hyatt Gold Card member, and for the cost, and because of the website's photos... we expected something more upscale. bed, pillows & sheets were great, the rooms are very old & VERY tired. the curtains were so full of moth-holes, the light shone right through! the carpet next to the walls was thick with dust (where a regular upright vacuum can't reach). the air conditioner rattled like an old car. the bedside lamp blinked like a strobe. the sliding glass door (that's supposed to open 4 inches for fresh air) was DUCT-TAPED SHUT, with duct tape all over the handle. the wallpaper was beginning to peel in the bathroom (why have wallpaper in a bathroom?). the batteries in the keyboard had run flat. the message light blinked and blinked, even though we didn't have messages. when we first arrived, we called the front desk & the ""engineer"" was called to fix the a/c. when we came back after shopping, it still wasn't done & found the light didn't work, so he had to come back to fix both. it took a while (in the morning) to come & see what was wrong with the keyboard, then to get new batteries. it would have been great to have things checked out BEFORE we got to the room! simple enough to run checks on these things after the room is cleaned and before the customer arrives? some clever person has discovered that because of the system employed in the minibar, if you put back an empty pringles or soda can, it looks like somebody's replaced it, & you don't get charged! & for Hyatt's prices, i actually don't blame them!the group next door came in at about 2am, slamming doors, then were up again making a racket at 7am. why not have the ""honeymooners"" in one area & leave these noisy groups of business people next door to each other in another? it wasn't as though we had a great view!wish i had taken photos, but this was my first anniversary of marriage, and it was just too depressing. and on top of all this, i contacted the Hyatt Gold Passport Rep who wrote to us, asking us to contact him if we needed anything...he has now received two emails from me & has yet to respond! give the nice staff a hotel that they can be proud of!",20-Sep-08,2
"First time staying at the Grand Hyatt and would recommend it for anyone heading to SFO for business. I was only in town for 2 nights, but the location was perfect, the fitness center had good equipment, view from my room was awesome (fantastic view of downtown), etc. etc. The restaurant had an even better view and had a great atmosphere, but I wasn't overly impressed with the food. I'll definitely stay here again, but will probably try other options for dinner.",18-Sep-08,4
"Stayed at Hotel because of the close proxsemty of the Phillipine consulate, After checking in to our room had to summond a repair person because toilet flush very slowly requring continuious holding of the handle. I aapreciated the location of this hotel even though some services(resturants) are overpriced, I had to continue having my electronic key reprogramed. The Hotel convenience was short lived when I went to get my car from the hotel valet parking was told while my car was staged in front of the Hotel was side swipe by a sightseeing bus while in there custody , neither the parking company are Hotel offered any financial liability to repair my vehicle but through all most daily calls to the bus companys insurance company creating constant frustration I was finally able with the help of this body shop got my vehicle repaired properly. In hingesight I would have been better off leaving my car parked in the parking garage across the street since the Hotel staff and parking company no this is a continual problem, so park in valet parking at your own risk. I gave this hotel another chance when I had guest visiting from out of town: on this ocassion the service was terrible, seems as though the staff are disorganized and to get anything acoomplish you either have to make your request more than once are see a manager to get anything done correctly again had tyo have my electronic key reprogramed everytime I returned to the Hotel an agonizing inconveince. This Hotel needs to make significant improvements at putting their guest first after all the stay here isn't cheap. One person that tried his best to provide some assistance was the security manager.",18-Sep-08,2
"This hotel is amazing. The accomodation is wonderful, the views from the higher hotel rooms (we were on 24th floor) are fabulous. THe bar on the top floor (36) has views and cocktails to die for. What made this hotel so amazing though on top of it being very very nice were the staff.Liz on Concierge was fantastic. We had been warned that there were always long waits for booking on Alcatraz. Liz got us on one within 6 hours, booked us on it over the phone and we were put straight to the front of the queue when we got there so there was no wait for us at all whereas others had had to wait a couple of days for a ticket and then had to queue for a long time once they got there. Concierge made sure we made the most of our 4 days there, they booked us everything from restaurants to the open top bus tour - nothing was too much for any of the staff there.",16-Sep-08,5
"Hotel website price is $180/night and I got it for $85/night through Priceline. However, the parking at this hotel is $50/night (valet parking too, meaning you need to tip them every time you go in and out), if you don't mind parking your car elsewhere, just research for other parking garage nearby for like $25 - $30 overnight parking.Check in was smooth and easy. The staff was very friendly and offered a 22nd floor Union Square Macy's view handicap room. Handicap room is only with lower bed, and more armrest by the bathtub and bigger bathroom space and living room space. Therefore, we thought it is ok and we took the offer.The night view was gorgeous! We were glad that the hotel didn't put us to any cheap room since we were priceline customer. The room itself is just a normal room, nothing fancy. My only complain is that the room is very close to another room. So, when your neighbor is talking outside or slamming the door, you can totally hear the noise!",4-Sep-08,3
"We stayed there for three nights and it was fantastic.Our room was spacious, clean and with a great view ( 19th floor).The staff is very kind, friendly and helpful. We had a problem with a baggage: we forgotten it into the taxi....they helped us immediately and we had the baggage back in 15 minutes.The hotel is close to Union Square, the Chinese district, the Financial district. We found very good restaurants at just 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Starbucks is just across the street.Check in was quick and we checked out through the tv system.",4-Sep-08,5
"I'm not sure what other people expected from this property, but I had an excellent stay. The room was more than adequate and the beds were superb. The bathroom was clean, nothing special really, but it was functional with nice soaps/shampoos and plush towels. The housekeeping staff were right on top of the little requests we made with a note and a tip. Our room was very quiet and we were on the 4th floor (requested a low floor). The location though makes this hotel. It is about as central as you can get in SF. Walk anywhere and everywhere. Need a Walgreens? Right there. Lori's Diner? Right there. Union Square shopping. Westfield Centre. Virgin Megastore. Coffee, Burritos. Sushi. Pasta. Everywhere! Just a great location for a short visit to San Francisco. If you have higher expectations, try the Ritz Carlton or the Omni. Otherwise, this place is right on par for the money in a major US city. A good value for an active and adventuresome traveler who wants some amenities when they come back from a long day scaling the hills of San Francisco.",24-Aug-08,4
"The Grand Hyatt in San Francisco is close to everything. It's right by Union Square and near the main bus routes and basically right on top of the cable car routes.  After driving into San Francisco, my husband and I both swore off driving in the city until we had to drive to leave. Its streets are chaotic! Thankfully, with the location of the hotel, we didn't have to worry. We were able to go sight seeing and see everything we wanted because of the location of the hotel near public transportation. Thanks the both the concierges who were able to give detailed bus/trolley/cable car routes to us. They were so helpful! Check in and check out was a breeze. The lobby is beautiful. Our rooms were smallish, but that's definitely what I expected in a high rise hotel in central San Francisco! We had excellent views from our room and from the lounge a few floor above us. Smashing.",22-Aug-08,5
"I stayed one night at the Grand Hyatt in mid-August 2008. i reserved a standard king and was upgraded to the club floor. The hotel and room were clean and well maintained. My room was quite spacious and had an outstanding view. Club level extras included a robe and access to the 32nd floor lounge. The mini TV in the bath had very poor reception and couldn't be watched. The continental breakfast buffet in the lounge was only fair.The room had two upholstered chairs that were only fair for comfort, but room lighting was excellent. The TV was conventional, probably about 26-inch. The program list in the guest info book didn't match the actual channels and there was no PBS channel, although one was listed in the book.Windows are not double-paned and street noise was very noticeable at night. Voices from the street were so clear on the 33rd floor that I thought the window must be open--it wasn't. Otherwise the room was quiet.The bath was relatively small, but a large counter just outside the bath provide lots of storage space. The shower head over the tub had gaps in the spray pattern.The location on Union Square is outstanding.Valet parking at $49, almost $56 with tax.This is a large 4-star hotel that could give more attention to some details. I don't know how the parking charge compares with other SF hotels.",20-Aug-08,4

I gave it a score of 7 out of 10.Pros: Great location in the middle of union SquareGreat city view from the room I stayedVery friendly and courtesy staffsCons:Black mildew in the showerDirty air filter in the roomThe double room I had was kind of small, especially the area between the desk and two sofas was crowded.",13-Aug-08,4
"Very mediocre. The view is nice, and I would recommend going for a drink at the 180 lounge just before sunset, but other than that, there are hotels with better decor, better accomodations and more convenient locations.It's only a few blocks from BART but those few blocks got annoying considering just the week before we were at a cheaper, nicer hotel directly next to a BART station. The biggest annoyance is that of the 3 different floors we visited, all three reeked of old cigarette smoke.",6-Aug-08,3
"We recently visited San Francisco and stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. This is a centrally located hotel very close to everything, one block from the Cable Car, and shopping is all around you. Upon Check in, one of our two rooms was ready so we placed all of our luggage in that room and hit the streets of San Francisco. When we returned, the other room was ready so we got our key and moved in. The hotel in general was in good shape. This is a big convention hotel so not really geared for families. No Pool, Game Room, or place the kids could hang out. The rooms are small but well furnished and the bathroom was standard size. The two thing that I hate to see in a hotel bathroom is hair from the previous guest and black mildew in the shower. This bathroom had both. I quickly rinsed the hair away before my wife saw it. Since we were only staying here one night we both agreed that the mildew would not cause us to make a room change. Mildew around the tub is not what you expect to see at a Hyatt. The guest services people were great giving us directions and maps as well as family friendly places to eat. When I return to San Francisco to get back my heart, I will most likely choose the Grand Hyatt.",29-Jul-08,3
Horrible Check in experience.An out dated property with dirty carpets and poorly appointed rooms.Breatfast buffet was not good.No room service after midnight.Expensive considering the negatives above.Location is the only saving grace.Hyatt....time to remodel!,28-Jul-08,1
"It was a toss up between the Westin San Francisco Market Street and the Grand Hyatt. The Westin had a guaranteed awesome view and a nicer room but was slightly more expensive, Hyatt had a AAA discount that included a breakfast buffet (Valued at $50 for 2 people). Opted for the Hyatt due to the price and breakfast. The breakfast buffet was a delicious and located on the 36th floor of the hotel with an awesome view. The other plus was the location of the hotel directly next to Union Square. Unfortunately we got a room on a very low floor with a view of the air conditioning equipment on the building next door. The walls were paper thin and we could hear the very passionate couple next door like they were in our room. The room was clean, but the fridge is a touch sensor based minibar and there is no room in it for storing leftovers from restaurants. If you need a nice very clean and well made room for a couple days and don't plan to spend all your time in the hotel I would recommend this hotel, especially with the AAA discount. I probably won't come back to this hotel though.",22-Jul-08,3
"My husband and I recently stayed here for a wedding so we did not have a choice in choosing the property, but were pleased with the location and the reviews did not look terrible. We may have been biased since we moved over here from the W Hotel, which was a completely different experience for many reasons, the most important of which was - Service, Service, Service. The Grand Hyatt needs to learn that the customer is always right and I am not one to complain to hotel staff but when you feel they are pulling one over on you it is a little hard not to complain. We paid extra for the Club level room but were not given one. When I complained, all they did was offer to refund me and take away access to the Club Lounge. So we stayed with the regular room and kept the club access. I didn't think in the end it was worth the $50. They had very light appetizers and a tiny breakfast in the morning. You could buy drinks in the evening - for $50 you think they could afford one or two free drinks? Our room was disappointing, I saw rooms on the Club level that were much nicer. The shower was terrible. No amenities to speak of. The 36th floor bar has nice views, but awful service, We waited forever for drinks and refills and food, unfortunately. I guess if you want location and views, go for it, but don't expect to get high-quality service. We usually stay in Starwood properties and are never disappointed. This venture into Hyatt did no sway us one bit!",16-Jul-08,2
"The Hyatt's location can't be beat. You can walk to all of the shops and restaurants in Union Square with no problem. Their Valet parking was expensive but there is also a parking garage directly across the street from it were you can park pretty resonably. The rooms were nothing special, ours seemed quite small, which I expected from SF, but the bed was comfy and furniture wasn't shabby. You can barely open your slider door 6 in which annoyed me but I was told they do it for safety reasons. The absolute best part of the hotel was the restaurant on one of the top floors. It has a 180 degree view of San Francisco with floor to ceiling windows. My boyfriend and I received complementry buffet breakfast with our booking (usually $50/ person). The buffet was excellent, they had a pretty good selection and everything was very fresh. They had the best french toast I've ever tatsed! All in all it was a good experience, I am sure you can find better hotels but you get a pretty good value with it being San Francisco.",9-Jul-08,3
Great locationComfy BedsBeautiful viewNice sky lounge friendly conciergeWould absolutly stay here again. Great place!,7-Jul-08,5
"Very interesting architecture. It is very large and grand in the lobby, but the standard rooms don't match. The front desk gentleman was very nice. We went to our room that had a view of the city and partial water. The window opened to a concrete rail and then straight drop down eleven stories. The lock on the window did not work and my husband pointed out that spiderman could break in. . . The first thing I noticed when I walked in the room was that the carpet had large, dark stains throughout. I expect more from a hotel of this rating and this price.The bed was firm and comfortable, with a duvet and soft sheets. The flat screen tv was a good touch.I agree with a previous reviewer's comment about the faucet. I had to use a tissue to turn it on and off.The main problem with this place is the price for what you're getting. Across the board everything is pricey. I paid $18 for oatmeal room service.The downstairs bar had terribley slow service and poured vodka like it was molasses. And it wasn't even crowded.Although I would probably stay here again - I would not look forward to it.",21-Jun-08,3
"I'm rating this hotel four stars mostly because it IS nicer than those to which I usually give three, but I do so somewhat begrudgingly. Actually there is quite a bit not to like.Let's start with the positives: Superb location at Union Square, so close to absolutely everything and easy to get everywhere you want to go. Great shopping and sightseeing nearby. The rooms are large and reasonably well furnished. I had a corner room, which the front desk said is larger than some of the other rooms, so you might try requesting one of those as a special request or an upgrade if you are so inclined. Front desk and staff were helpful and friendly. The restaurant and bar at the top have a great view, but I didn't try the food so cannot comment on that. Negatives (or not-so-positives): It's a typical, run-of-the-mill, large, urban Hyatt convention hotel. There is no style or charm to speak of. It's very pricey, and you're not getting luxury accomodations. While the funishings were fine, a couple of the lamps in my room were dinged up and cheap looking--surprising for a room in this price range. Because it has so many rooms, at peak times the elevators run really slow. I was surprised at how much sound I could hear through the door and walls. Fortunately, there were no partiers. Basically, you are staying here because your company has a contract with Hyatt, you are building up your Hyatt points, your convention is here, or you are from out of town and you recognize the Hyatt name and figure it's a safer choice than all those other San Francisco hotels you have never heard of. If you'll look around, you likely will find other hotels with as good a location for the same or less money that will be much more interesting.",20-Jun-08,4
"I've seen many bad reviews on this but honestly i think it's pretty decent. Grand Hyatt has one of the best location, walking distance to all the shops and public transport. Sears which served the best pancakes was also just round the corner. We had a fabulous view of Union Square from our room and it was really pretty! The bathroom was of a good size and there was almost instant hot water, so didnt have to wait too long. Nice amenities too. Only one problem - concierge was not the friendliest people.",19-Jun-08,4
"Thereâ€™s not much I can add about this hotel that hasnâ€™t already been said here, and frankly Iâ€™m surprised this place doesnâ€™t have a higher overall TA ranking. The location is fantastic; it appears to be in the middle of everything. Getting there from the BART station is a snap.Check in was very quick, and I got a bay view room on the 30th floor. For a 312-sq ft room, it did seem spacious, and it was very clean. It was a windy weekend but there was very little noticeable creaking noise. The bed was very comfortable, but I really donâ€™t need 6 pillows and 3 cushions. Thermostat was so simple, even my mother could use it [not an insult, she just hates gadgets], and room safe was a decent size. Great water pressure in sink and shower, with kind of a shallow bathtub. I knocked some items around when checking out the refreshment center, which triggered a charge to my room, but a call to the front desk took care of that of with no hassle. Finally, the food at Grandviews was veeerrrrry good, as was the service. What impressed me most were the personnel of the Grand Hyatt. This hotel actually had one of the friendliest, maybe the friendliest, staffs I have ever encountered at a hotel. I especially commend the front desk and concierge teams who were both very helpful and pleasant, and really made the stay more enjoyable.Side note: I had requested a refrigerator a few weeks earlier through E-Concierge, but there was no fridge in the room. I didnâ€™t pursue it with the staff because I seem to have refrigerator issues with Hyatt properties, and I didnâ€™t want to be bothered. However, I did mention it in follow-up correspondence to hotel management, so weâ€™ll see what they say about that. And now for some indirect stuff: I wondered why many reviewers seem to go ape over the Macyâ€™s a couple of blocks away, but now I see whyâ€_itâ€™s actually two stores, the 8-story main store and the 5â€“story menâ€™s store across the street. Thatâ€™s 13 stories of Macyâ€™s goodness, topped by a Cheesecake Factory at the main store. Also the 24-hour Walgreenâ€™s around the block which is very convenient, and Iâ€™m not a coffee drinker, but there are two very nearby Starbucks for those who are into that sort of thing. I donâ€™t know if anyone has mentioned the Mrs. Fields cookie shop across from the back entrance. And as others have noted, Sears Fine Food is also around the corner, along with a Mortonâ€™s Steakhouse a little farther away, and a great selection of eating choices, especially if you are willing to walk up hilly Powell Street a little bit. Overall, I strongly recommend this property; great location and great value.",5-Jun-08,5
"To begin with we used our credit card points so we did not have to pay what would have normally been a bit pricey for us. You are right in the middle of the super high end shops and next to Union Square where there are weekend festivals. We walked to Chinatown, the cablecar and the streetcar to get to Fisherman's Wharf, Coit Tower, and every park imaginable. FYI-Market street is a little sketchy depending on where you are but that is several blocks away. Do your research on neighborhoods and where to go and where to avoid.  The rooms are clean and comfortable (we had a King view room)and have very good views if you are up high enough. The Lounge on the 36th floor has fantastic views on a clear day and we spent at least an hour taking pics and admiring the views while enjoying a drink. They had cheese and wine for us in our room upon our arrival for our honeymoon. The concierge is very helpful--use them. Getting a cab is no problem--just talk to the doorman.  If you want to use the luggage cart you have to use a bellman=have to tip. Ours was very helpful with information, helping out with luggage and general pleasant conversation.",3-Jun-08,4
"I enjoyed my one night stay at the Grand Hyatt.I was very impressed with the room which was large with contemporary ultra-modern type furnishings.The location of this hotel absolutely cannot be beaten and I also encountered no homeless people in the immediate vicinity of the hotel - a big bonus in San Francisco.I did notice a couple of creaks in the walls which I have never experienced before at any hotel but these died down after 2 minutes and I never heard them again.I ate lunch and dinner at Wolfgang Puck's takeaway which had great quality food freshly cooked at reasonable prices - it was located in the basement of Macy's department store across from the hotel.I did encounter a service hiccup when I asked for a pair of weighing scales to weigh my luggage. This simple request was a major issue - apparently they only have one pair of scales in the entire hotel. I suggest that the hotel management cross the road to Macy's and buy 5 more weighing scales as many travellers need to weigh their luggage. If you can't afford the Four Seasons, which in my opinion would be the ultimate San Francisco hotel, I would stay here. I would recommend this hotel to my friends.",31-May-08,4
"I prefer boutique hotels and San Francisco has a lot of them. However, I was not paying for the room at the Grand Hyatt so did not get to choose. I have no complaints about the room, it was clean, comfortable and had the expected amenities. The view towards the Coit Tower was fabulous. The view from the bar at the top was also great. Too bad the fitness room, also near the top, has no windows at all. The location is great but there are tons of choices in the same area.There were a few problems, the outside door which was supposed to open to let in fresh air got stuck after only opening a crack and room service was somewhat slow. The biggest disappointment was the lack of knowledge of the front desk staff. We asked for a good wine shop and were directed to a corner store with no good wines, only cheap ones. We found a huge wine specialty store on the other side of Union Square by wandering around ourselves. I would have expected better knowledge, especially since San Francisco hosts so many wine loving tourists.If I was going to pay for a room, I would look for a boutique at a cheaper rate.",27-May-08,3
Loved this hotel! The location is fabulous. Our room looked out over Union Square. Everything was within walking distance and we were so close to the cable cars. The rooms are nice and spacious and the concierge was fantastic at helping us out. They organised everything from restaurant bookings to car hire.We booked online and received a 7 day confirmation. Everything was so easy and the hotel prices were quite competitive for what you get.,23-May-08,5
"This hotel is in a great location, one block from Union Square. I lived in SF for several years, so I know my way around, and I would definitely recommend the location. Shopping, restaurants, and cable cars are very close by, and it is about 4 blocks to BART (subway). The restaurant at the top of the hotel has great views of the city (when it's not foggy), the food is fairly good but pricey. The rooms are average, especially for what you are paying, although SF is notoriously expensive. Was disappointed that internet access was not included (it is $10 per day). Don't rent a car and park at the hotel, parking is $40 a day, and driving around SF, especially if you are not familiar with the city, is not recommended. Take a cab, BART, or cable cars. The best feature of this hotel is location, the service was fair, although they will print your flight boarding pass at the front desk.",21-May-08,3
"Marvellous hotel and very very comfortable beds after an 11 hour flight from Dublin the beautiful beds were a fabulous welcome. Room service was propmt and delicious, however the menu is limited and really should only be treated as a snack menu.The location was excellent right on Union Square - convenient for shopping and transportation connections. The cable cars are right around the corner and are fun to ride to Fishermans Wharf - but scary on the hills. My sister turned 30 while we were in San Francisco and I reserved a table in the restaurant on the 31st floor of the Grand Hyatt to celebrate. The service and the food were top notch, the sommelier and maitre'd were very knowlegeable and made some excellent suggestions. We adjourned to the bar after our very delicious meal and enjoyed the views of the bay and out to Alcatraz. The cocktails were very tasty!I woudnt recommend the hotel for breakfast, an excellent alternative is the Sears diner around the corner which seems to be an institution in San Francisco for both locals and tourists. Really excellent breakfasts are served in Sears.I really loved San Fransisco and I think the Grand Hyatt was the ideal hotel, I would definitely return here if I am ever lucky enough to go to San Francisco again.",18-May-08,4
"My wife and I stayed here on a 2-night side trip from Napa. We picked this hotel because of the great deal we received on the internet. Check-in was a breeze, but the $54/day rate for valet parking was a turn-off. Call us cheap, but we said ""no thanks"" and parked on the street for free since it was after 6pm. The next morning (Saturday) at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot. This giant lot is catty-corner to the hotel and charges $32 a day. Although the Sutter lot does not allow in/out service, we used the savings to buy two, 24-hour muni bus/rail passes and a muni-map. You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window. Driving and parking is such a hassle, I would recommend using the metro. We went to a Giants game, the wharf, and a concert on the bus/street car and Bart and never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a ride. We had a nice room on the 25th floor. The room was 4-star, but the lack of services (e.g. pool, gift shop) make the entire property a 3.5 star. Still, it was a great value and the location can't be beat. Everything is close. We shopped at Macy's and went to Walgreens for our snacks. Both are a block away. The concierge desk in the lobby is excellent!! Based on the comments from another reviewer, we also tried Sears Fine Foods (near Walgreens) for breakfast, and the Starlight Lounge (atop the Drake Hotel) for drinks and dancing. Both places are highly recommended. The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf. Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience. Denver does a much better job by discouraging tourists form giving to panhandlers and putting donation meters downtown to help fund the shelters and food kitchens.",12-May-08,4
"We stayed at the Hyatt in January and it was fantastic. We had two club rooms with great views overlooking the city. Both our rooms had two double beds in them and there was a lot of room. We had 5 suitcases in each room but we still had room to move. The beds are soft and extremely comfortable and the room is well maintained. As part of the club room we had access to the club facilities which included a continental breakfast every morning in the club room, afternoon tea, tea, coffee, water and soft drinks all day, canapes at night (alcoholic drinks you had to pay for) and supper which was usually a cake and biscuits.The people serving in the club room were absolutely brilliant. They could not do enough for you. We were amazed that we were allowed to help ourselves to fruit and soft drink all day and take them back to our room. At night we took back to our rooms cookies and hot drinks and it was great. The hotel is right next to Union Square. You couldn't get a better location if you want to shop. We even walked down to Fisherman's wharf which took about 30 minutes but it was a nice stroll through China town. Macy's is just across the square from the hotel and all the shops you need. Around the corner is a supermarket so a perfect location for a shopping holiday. The hotel doesn't have a spectacular lobby so don't expect to sit in the afternoon in a nice looking lobby. It is nice but not grand.A great stay to end our world trip.",6-May-08,5
"We have just returned home after 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco, stopping there to get over jet lag after flying back from two months in Asia. We had a Regency Club room which really offered nothing more than a not impressive continental breakfast in the over crowded lounge on the 31st floor. The room was not large, the decor was drab and the furnishings were very, very tired. In fact, we had last stayed at this hotel 32 years ago and I am sure the furnishings, with the exception of the very comfortable bed, are exactly the same as they were then when the hotel was new. This is the only hotel I can ever recall having absolutely NO BATHMAT or RUG of any sort for the bathroom floor and the very low tub/shower combo has no grab bars for safety when using the shower. The Grand Hyatt ""up the road"" in Seattle is one of our most favorite hotels in the world and the Grand Hyatt San Francisco could certainly take some lessons from her Seattle cousin!",3-May-08,3
"This was a girlfiends getaway and the Grand Hyatt was the perfect central location to everything we could want. The hotel is nice and the employees were very helpful. The concierge made nightly recomendations for nice dinning locations where the ambiance was excellent but the food was mediocore at best however ask the staff at the bar upstairs and we got the best information on where to go and what to do. Speaking of the bar upstairs, you have to enjoy the view from the 36th floor even if just for a couple of drinks. The drinks were good and very reasonable so were the desserts (try the carrot cake) however it is all about the view when you are 36 stories up. We truly appreciated housekeeping as we made one call on our first evening in town and advised that we needed extra towels since there were 4 women in one room and they made sure, each night we were there, to leave plenty of extra towls. Also upon check in our bell hop asked what we would be doing and offered to bring us a refrig so that we could store any edibles free of charge. He was the sweetest and it really helped our stay as we stashed our wine bottles after the tour and plenty of bottled water and snacks in the fridge. As for the location right across from a FABULOUS MACY's and other great stores for easy last minute needs but also a few blocks from the Powell Station where all transportaion avenues can be accessed. Three places within blocks of the hotel that you MUST try...House of Nanking at 919 Kearney, the absolute best Chinese ever!! If you arrive after 7pm almost any day you will probably have to wait outside, it is small but INCREDIBLE and definately worth the wait. Sears Fine Foods at 439 Powell is wonderful for breakfast there is also a little spa next door to Sears where we all expierenced great service as we got facials, massage, and pedi/mani, very resonable prices too. Also a block away at the Hotel Drake is a fun bar at the top of the hotel where the view is amazing and the drinks and dancing were a lot of fun. This place was a fun hang out when we didn't want to go far for a little dancing.",26-Apr-08,4
"We (family of four with kids 7 and 12) stayed at the Grand Hyatt for spring break week this year and were very happy with the hotel.The room didn't have all that great a view, but was clean, everything in working order, and the beds were comfortable. The location is excellent - we used BART, streetcars and cable cars to get everywhere and the hotel is convenient for all three.The breakfast buffet on the top floor is good - not cheap - and the view is gorgeous. We had room service dinner twice and the food was excellent (again, not cheap) and the service prompt.Staff were attentive and helpful and I felt well looked after even with the little things - print-your-boarding-pass kiosk in the lobby, morning paper at the door,",26-Apr-08,4
"I was somewhat disappointed by this place, worst of all was the noise, and more specifically the creaking in the walls! On my first night I called the front desk to complain about what I can only describe as the sound of creaking timbers in the wall. They told me it was the wind and the building is having some sort of earthquake work going on. Only way they could help was to move to the 3rd floor where it wasn't so ""creaky"" but then I'd hear the traffic!The room was nicely decorated in typical Hyatt style, but the TV was fuzzy (and no one could fix it) and the toilet slow to flush (again no one could fix this!). Although when I called about the TV and toilet they where very quick to send someone up. Best thing about this place was the bar on the 36th floor where the view was stunning. The crowd is older, okay geriatric, but it's a great view at Sunset and the drinks are top notch.Overall it was okay, but I wont go out of my way to stay there again.",17-Apr-08,2
"I just got back from the Grand Hyatt and am missing it already. Check in was almost flawless. Ryan at the check in desk is hysterical and made the process more fun than should be allowed. They were having a problem with the key card machine when I got there so they were having the staff personally escort people to their rooms. This was very quickly resolved however and in the time it took me to freshen up a little and walk out of the restroom there was an envelope that had been slid under my door containing the key cards and a letter apologizing.  The room was immaculately clean and the view was absolutely incredible. I stayed on the 19th floor and woke up each morning to a view of the COIT tower and the bay. The cleaning staff did a good job keeping my room clean and stocked and the daily newspaper was laying in front of my door each morning by 7am.  I have seen in a couple of reviews where people have complained about charges for the mini bars in their rooms. I had no trouble at all with that issue because I requested a refridgerator in my room. There is no charge, it was clean and properly working and was there and set up when I got there and already cold. If you request that then you can purchase your own drinks and snacks and keep them in it and then you will not have to worry about charges for the mini bar. I took the BART to the hotel from the airport and it was completely painless. There is a BART station right at the airport and the cost for the trip was a whole $5.35. The BART is perfectly roomy enough for you to take your luggage onto it. It is not like a cramped city bus. The stop for the hotel lets you off about 3 blocks away and it is an easy walk even with luggage in tow.  For those who are shopaholics there is almost every store you can imagine within a few blocks. There is a Starbucks across the street, a Walgreens pharmacy behind the hotel and a number of very good restaurants. The cable car stop for going to the wharf is one block behind the hotel. And the entrance to Chinatown is about 3 blocks away. There is also a mini mart/liquor store a half a block away where you can get things like cokes or drinks to take back to your room.  I was traveling as a single female and never once did I feel unsafe. The area is very friendly and clean and if you need to make a run to get some last minute thing you can do it without worry.  The staff was all wonderful. As I said in the beginning Ryan is hysterical. Lyle is very friendly and helpful. Truly a nice guy. Adam who is one of the doormen/valets is the class clown. Take the time to get to know him if you are a cut up yourself. And my absolute favorite was Joe Vigil who is one of the security officers. San Francisco should be proud to call him one of their own. I actually miss him. David at the concierge desk was also fabulous. Very friendly and helpful and has a warm and honest smile. There is also a gentleman who is from Yugoslavia who is always at the front door. I apologize to him for not remembering his name but he is also very sweet. There was only one person I ran into the entire time that was not up to par with the rest of the staff and that was the blonde woman at the concierge desk. She is not ""unkind"" but she reminds you more of dealing with the assistant to the president of a large corporation. More of a ""state your purpose"" kind of gal. Everyone else though were all poster children for tourism and public relations for the hotel and the city.  While you are there you also have to check out the view from the lounge on the 36th floor. Go at night. The view is breathtaking and will make you want to stay there forever.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is staying in San Francisco and commend the management for the staff they have put together.",16-Apr-08,5
"We stayed here on our way to the East Coast (from Australia). The room was lovely, with a nice view of the city. The hotel service was excellent. And the location was great for a short stop in the city (located in Union Square). Perfect stop for a break in our journey.",12-Apr-08,4
"Great location on Union Square, booked twin and king both with city views. Rooms both good size. When checking in worth asking for a room on higher floor, The restaurant and bar on the top floor is well worth a visit. We had a drink there in the evening, fantastic views, equally so in the morning for breakfast which was very good value. Expensive valet parking but when you dont know your way around a city there isnt really any other option. Watch where you book these rooms. The hyatt website proclaims to offer the cheapest rate and offers a price promise however when I found a cheaper rate elsewhere which met all of their published criteria they started quoting other criteria that I had to meet which wasnt published on their site. As we were travelling from the UK I had booked with Virgin holidays who were much cheaper than anyone else.",6-Apr-08,4
"Just spent four nights here on a work trip. My room faced the front of the building so no great view, which was ok since it was work and all, but I was constantly annoyed by the loud, shrill whistles of the hotel staff hailing cabs for people. Awful sound.The room itself was spacious and clean and the hotel staff was courteous and helpful. However, there was one other tidbit that annoyed me during this stay and I find this unbecoming of a nice hotel. There was a coffeemaker in the room but coffee wasn't free. A label on it read ""complimentary coffee inside the refreshment center."" But when you open that door, the coffee is sitting with the candy and water on the sensors and in the door it says coffee is $4. Overall, a pleasant stay that would've been greatly improved by complimentary coffee and the lack of whistles.",31-Mar-08,3
"My husband, six year old son and I spend four nights here over my son's spring break. I picked the hotel because I got a really good rate and it was in Union Square. First the good. If you want to stay in Union Square it's a very good location with public transporation/foot travel within easy distance. The staff were all great and immediately helpful. There is a place at the front desk to print out boarding passes for free. My husband said the work out room was very nice but there's no pool. Now the not so great. The room is cramped. There is not really a good workable space ie no desk. There is a table but it's not positioned well and it's too high for a workspace. Internet is $10 a day and that irritates me. There's a fantastic view from the restaurant but it is very pricey to eat there. We stayed on the third floor and had to wait for elevators. I can only imagine if the hotel had been booked full what the wait would be like for higher floors!There is plenty of shopping within a few blocks and several restaurants. You can also walk to car rental offices within a few blocks. Bottom line we enjoyed our visit but I doubt I would overwhelmingly recommend this property unless you want to be in Union Square specifically.",25-Mar-08,3
"We checked in to the Hyatt on Thursday the 20th and are leaving on Monday the 24th. When we made the reservation, we asked for a roll-away which they didn't know about when we checked in.We paid an extra sixty dollars to upgrade to a suite which wasn't as great as it seemed. When making the reservation, we requested the bay view room. You can see a small amount of the bay but it is all blocked by the Port of San Francisco building.The mini-bar in the room is way over-priced. $3.50 for a can of soda when you can go across the street and get a twelve pack of soda for less than that. There were a number of broken items in the room when we checked in. The light in the shower stall was and is still dead. The latch on the cabinet in the room for the minibar/dresser was broken. None of the lights in the room are hooked to the light switched. The latch on the sliding glass doors/window are broken. There is a bunch of wire for the phone just hanging out of the wall and the rooms aren't very well lit.I stay at Hyatt's a lot for business and pleasure but I have never seen one in such bad shape.We stopped by the fitness center which is the worst fitness center that I have ever seen. It is about 15' x 30'. Pretty small, plus they don't have a pool or hut tub in the hotelThe pricing for services in the hotel is crazy. Albeit this is San Francisco and a tourist trap, they are still crazy.

"The location of the Grand Hyatt is great. Union square is right outside the doors of the hotel. Tons of designer shopping and restaurants to choose from. Close to Chinatown. It was so easy to walk practically everywhere in the downton area from the hotel. It was also easy to catch a cab to surrounding neighborhoods in the San Francisco area such as Golden Gate Park and North Beach areas. I pre-arranged a towncar car airport pick-up and drop-off through the hotel e-concierge before my arrival. The drivers were prompt and polite. Upon arrival the staff were friendly and courteous. The concierge desk was helpful and provided maps. Unfortunately I was not able to get an early check-in as I requested since my flight landed at 11:30 AM and I was at the hotel by 12:30 PM. But they were able to check and hold my bags so I could begin exploring the city. I was able to use their facilities, which were nice and clean, to freshen up beforehand. I reserved a bay view king room and it was on the 24th floor. The view was nice, since I was able to see the bay, part of Alcatraz, Angel Island, and party of the city. The room was clean and of average size. A little worn but not too bad. It could stand to be updated some more. The whole hotel seemed worn in general, especially the furniture. One feature I liked was I was able to slide open my window about 4 inches to let in fresh air, as the hotel room smelled kind of stale. I left the window open during my entire stay. One negative aspect is you have to pay 10 dollars a day for internet access. Some other hotels I was debating between did offer free internet access. Also, the television was old and dated compared to other hotels in this category.I did not eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel. I opted for local restaurants in the area. I did order room service a few times. The Angus burger and fries were quite delcious. The chips, salsa and guacamole were good. I was a little disappointed in a fresh seasonal fruit tray I ordered. The only fruit I recieved was a little bunch of purple grapes and one strawberry cut in half. I expected a little more than what I received. Overall, my experience at this hotel was good. I give this hotel only 3 stars because it was average, nothing more. It definitely did not exceed my expectations for the price. I probably will try another hotel the next time I visit this city.",20-Mar-08,3
"The grand hyatt is a hotel located right in front of Union Square, where all shops, restaurants are. The location is perfect, you can walk to chinatown, the cablecar is one block away and macys, bloomingdales, apple, etc are around the corner.The hotel was once a 5 star, now the rooms seem old, though spacious (king room has more space than 2 queen bed room)the bathroom is really old, ugly, but clean.200 dolar a night, was not very cheap, but the other hotels in this location, Marriott, Four Seasons are much more expensive and luxorious, of course.Breakfast is ridiculous, it cost 16-20 dollars, depending on what you eat, but the buffet is so small, you could easily go to a starbucks (in front of the hotel) or macys to have a coffe and some pastries.garage is extremely expensive, about 50 dollars/day.",19-Mar-08,3
Staff very friendly and helpful from the front desk to doormen to the concierge. Doormen were always opening the door for my party and the concierge offered several excellent restaurant Conventiently located near the cable car line and a short walk from the convention center. Room -- Bed was comfortable but lighting could be better. Closet door was broken. The whole hotel needs some remodeling.Excellent view from the restaurant on the top floor.Exercise room is one of the best I've experienced in a hotel. Even had headphones for you to plug into the equipment!,18-Mar-08,4
"I stayed on the 17th floor from March 11-March 14, 2008. This hotel is excellent. The front desk staff is fast and nice. Bell staff is on top of things. The room was perfect, very clean and even had a safe! Bed slept very well and the view was excellent. It is a little pricey but it is in the center of the action. Highly recommend for the business traveler.",17-Mar-08,5
"We have stayed here twice for 4 nights and 8 nights in the last 2 years. We upgraed to a suite using hyatt points and the room was very nice with a great view. We got a rollaway and there was plenty of room for the four of us. The bed in the main room was a very comfortable king bed. The location is perfect. We can take the cable car down to fisherman's wharf as needed, walk to the ferry building, and get theater tickets at half price at Union Square.",14-Mar-08,5
"After reading a few TA reviews, I was a bit apprehensive about staying 3 nights at this hotel. However, I needn't have worried. It was an excellent choice. The location was perfect (everything within walking distance), the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, the rooms were very good (not 5* perfect but near enough) and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The concierge was also so helpful at finding excellent local restaurants (which also happened to be really cheap). I would recommend starting off the day having the buffet breakfast (about $25) on the top floor. The views of the city, harbour, golden gate bridge and alcatraz are stunning. If you don't want breakfast just pop in for a drink or a sit down. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",7-Mar-08,5
"This is a great hotel. My top criteria for selecting a hotel is the quality of the beds. The beds at this hotel are amongst the best. The rooms are very clean and everything is top quality. My only complaint would be the room did not have sufficient lighting. Outside of that, this is an excellent hotel.",1-Mar-08,5
We stay at many Hyatt Hotels. We felt their guest rooms need renovations. Lobby seems outdated and need for a soft renovations to update decor. Staff was very friendly and the concierce desk was very helpful.,29-Feb-08,3
"Got a $143/night AAA promo rate, which made me want to try the Grand Hyatt. In this case, got what we paid for. Upon check in, we were presented with a piece of paper that claimed there would be noise due to stormy weather. The noise was non stop- it was a creaking that went on all day and all night. After one night of bad sleep, called the front desk and were told that the noise was due to the earthquake retrofitting. The higher floors were particularly problematic. Upon moving to a lower floor, there was an improvement.The room itself was adequately furnished, the bed was comfortable, with soft sheets and lots of pillows. The towels, however, were of a very poor quality, scratchy and thin. The first room did not have a garbage can. The T.V. was ancient with very few channels. No robes, no slippers, minimal toiletries.Valet parking at $55.night was a complete rip-off,On the plus side, the staff was extremely responsive to any problems - lamp wasn't working in second room and maintenance was there in less than five minutes to fix it.",25-Feb-08,2
"We've just spent 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt and we simply couldn't fault it!When we arrived the reception area was quiet so we were checked in within minutes. Our room, on the 11th floor, was superb, spacious and clean. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and there were some nice touches in the room, like the radio alarm clock with an ipod dock (we were so impressed with it we're going to buy one!). You also get a free local paper left outside your door every morning.There was plently of storage space and there's a safe tucked away within the wardrobe, together with an iron and full size ironing board. There's also a well stocked minibar, hairdryer and a TV in the bathroom! One night our safe wouldn't open, so we reported it on the way back to our room - I hadn't even got my coat off when the chap arrived to fix it! He literally turned up at our room less than a minute after we got there. All the staff we came across were incredibly polite and friendly and none of them could do enough to help you. The concierge in particular was incredibly helpful.We had a couple of nights were it was very windy, and on those occasions we had a letter pushed under the door to reassure us that any noises we heard the buidling make were normal and not to worry!We didn't eat at the hotel, so can't comment on the quality of the food or the prices, but we did visit the lounge on the 36th floor for a drink - and the views were stunning. Worth going up there just for a look! We read a few reviews were guests had complained about the delays in waiting for the lifts, but even though there were a couple of conventions on when we were there, we never had to wait more than a minute for a lift.We'd also read about baggage being left in the foyer, but when we checked out and asked to leave our bags they were tagged and put away in a secure room by guest services.The location of the hotel is superb - you're right on Union Square and within minutes of Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany's etc etc, and not very far from the cable cars.[One tip - we bought a 7 day Muni pass from Tourist Info for $24 each (you can also get 1 day and 5 day passes) - this allowed us unlimited travel on any cable car ($5 one way), all Muni buses and the street cars - it was a godsend as we travelled everywhere by public transport (clean and very easy to use) so we saved ourselves a fortune.]All in all we had a fantastic holiday and the hotel made it all the more enjoyable. We can't recommend it enough and we would definitely stay there again.",22-Feb-08,5
"This hotel has a good location and the bar on the 36th floor is very nice, but the hotel itself is quite noisy. It is not so much the location on Union Square, but the design of the hotel. All rooms except one on each floor have adjoining doors, so you can hear everything going on in the room next door to you. We had to listen to a woman talk on her cell phone for hours. The room itself was fine --nothing special -- but if you want a quiet nights sleep, I would stay elsewhere.",13-Feb-08,3
"The Grand Hyatt hotel is perfect if you want to shop and be in close proximity to all the major tourist attractions. The hotel is steps away from busy Union square and excellent shopping! I have stayed at a few SF downtown hotels however this is now definately one of my favourite hotels. l didn't have a reservation at the Grand Hyatt as I actually had not planned to stay at this hotel - l was booked to stay at the Campton Place hotel(part of the Taj hotels and supposedly one of the world's leading hotels) however after spending a night at this hotel, it was so bad that l just had to leave (l wont get into details now, l'll have to write another review for this one!). I walked into the Hyatt and was greeted by smiling & friendly hotel staff. Luckily, they had rooms available and I was quickly checked in to a deluxe room and escorted to my room. The room was reasonably sized - very clean and nicely furnished. My room package also included buffet breakfast which had a good variety of tasty food and great views of dowtown San Francisco(l am told the hotel offers the best views of the city). When l checked out, l asked for a taxi to be organised as l needed to get to the airport. lnstead of hailing down a taxi for me, l was suprisingly escorted to the hotels private luxury sedan and was told l would only be charged the rate of a taxi ride. They didnt even try to sell me the private transfers, they just offered it - a very nice and unexpected gesture! A great finish to a short but fantastic stay at the Grand Hyatt.l will definately stay at this hotel again & highly recommend it!",6-Feb-08,5
"Centrally located right on Union Square. Great room overlooking the bay. Superb penthouse bar and excellent food all served overlooking Alcatraz Island, The Golden Gate Bridge and the bay.We stayed there during 'Fleet Week' and was extremely busy but made for a better atmosphere. Would recommend anyone wishing to visit SF during Oct make sure you incorporate 'Fleet Week' to take in the Air Show and party atmosphere.If looking to visit during 'Fleet Week' would suggest you book Alcatraz in advance (before you travel) as we did as there were no available spaces for the whole duration of 'Fleet Week'. Within walking distance of the hotel there several car hire companies, would recommend you hire a car for a day and drive out to Muir Woods over The Golden Gate Bridge.If transfers are not included in your holiday package, don't bother pre-booking. We did and came to $60 (return) and you could be the last drop off, get a taxi it will only cost you $40 + tip (one way)and you will be at your hotel within 20-30mins. We chose to get the hotel town car but to the airport nd this too was only $40 + tip (one way).",4-Feb-08,5
"We booked through a special advertised on travelzoo, due to the price, out stay was spot on. However, for the normal rate which is about twice as much as we paid - I would have reservations on the grand hyatt SF. The room was fine, basic but nice with a comfortable bed. Overall hotel amenities, were less than desirable. For one, there isn't a gift shop on site which means if you're thirsty, forgot stamps or want a snack - you have to leave the premises to find a drugstore, coffeeshop or the like. I travel quite a bit so the fact that I could not buy basics like bottled water without leaving the hotel was a first. Also, this appears to be a SF thing but the valet service costs a pretty penny. We opted not to rent a car because of this and since public transportation is readily available, we were fine. The location is fantastic - right in the midst of union square. In short - a suitable hotel in the perfect location.",29-Jan-08,3
"My husband and I must've looked really excited to be there (without kids) for the weekend because we were given a nice quiet room on the 30th floor - the view wasn't of Union Square but I thought it was nice to be able to see the city lights at night. Upon arrival in our room, a staff member delivered a bottled of champagne with chocolate-dipped strawberries. Not expecting this at all, we asked if he was in the correct room! He said yes, and it was complements of the hotel. Wow. Now, I've read in previous reviews that the hotel is scheduled for renovation. I hope so because the rooms are in dire need of updating. They are decently decorated but the bathrooms need serious attention. I also didn't care for the overpowering deodorizer that they use when cleaning the rooms. I remember the scent from our stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Diego. On the plus side, the beds were comfortable and the bedding adequate. When the renos are done, this hotel will be awesome. Knowing that we weren't spending all of our time in the hotel room, my hotel requirements were a little different - location was my priority. The location of the Grand Hyatt is great. We walked all around Union Square (just around the corner) - and all the way to Chinatown. The only time we used public transportation is when we hopped on the cable car to go down to Fishermans Wharf. The Grand Hyatt's restaurant, Grandview, has been called overrated by some reviewers but I thought it was a perfect spot to unwind after so much walking. We sat in the lounge, ordered a few appetizers and drinks and enjoyed the wonderful view of the city. Coming from a place in Southern California where there are only two tall buildings in our whole city, I was mesmerized. The pianist was entertaining, too.I would consider staying there again, especially after the renovations!",24-Jan-08,4
"I stayed here for a week. The room was small, but clean. It may have been small because I asked for a quiet room and they put me at the end of the hotel. The food was not great, but you can walk to many restaurants instead. There is a drug store and starbucks across the street. The gym was small, but decent. You can walk to just about anything in SF from this location. I have no complaints about this hotel.",12-Jan-08,4
"Having stayed with this hotel many times over the years I knew not expect too much and certainly not what one expects of a Grand Hyatt. But the location is great, and I've usually had acceptable rooms. The Gentleman that check us in was in training with a more seasoned staff member looking over his shoulder. The first room assigned on a scale of 1-10 was a 3 at best. The air conditioning outlet had mold on it; as well as the tile in the bathroom. The room was VERY tired looking. I called the front desk and asked for another room. I was told they would ""upgrade"" us to a room over looking Union Square. I wasn't so concerned about the view as the room itself and explained that to the Gentleman. Again, he wasn't familiar with the hotel or rooms but we took the room offered. It was a bit larger and with the view mentioned. Fact is this hotel needs a makeover. The furniture, carpets and drapes show much wear and tear. This hotel consistantly has a very high occupancy rate and is probably quite profitable. The competition is very stiff in San Francisco but for whatever reason this Grand Hyatt has not kept up with it. I'm returning to the city in a few days and as much as I would like to stay there again I will not. For me when I travel my hotel is my home and the Grand Hyatt is not living up to the expectations one would have under the Hyatt name!",9-Jan-08,2
"We were there for New Years. We found the staff exceptional!It is a busy time for a nice hotel in San Francisco. I think the hotel goes beyond the call of duty to try and make the guests as happy as can be.The rooms are clean and the beds are great! As the hotel emptied out for a couple of days after the holiday, there were no problems with elevators or the regency club. In fact, we found the Regency club lovely and it has a beautiful view of the city.The hotel is starting room renavations soon.The Union Square location is fantastic! Close to everything!We found managment lovely and would come back in a minute!We had a group of four rooms, each and everyone of them had a beautiful view, all were clean.",3-Jan-08,5
"Just returned from a 5-night stay over the holiday week. I don't know how Hyatt decides which properties get the ""Grand"" title but this defintely should not be one of them. This hotel is average (at best) in just about every way. Some brief comments: -- The hotel lobby is really small and was constantly crowded. -- Check-in line was so slow we opted for self check-in. -- Room was just OK. Furniture crammed into every nook & cranny. Could hear noise from other rooms periodically. TV in bathroom was a joke as it barely got any reception. Furnishings were a bit beat up. This would be a lousy hotel for business as the room did not have an actual desk to work at. -- Elevators were perhaps the worst I have ever experienced in a hotel (or any building). I would have assumed that 6 elevators for 36 floors would be more than sufficient - not so. When an elevator would finally show up (usually after 5 minutes or more) it was usually already packed. We ended up taking the service stairs more than once. Very, very frustrating! -- Location is great if you are looking to be in the center of the action. Tons of shopping right outside. Chinatown just a few blocks away. Cable Cars & BART closeby as well. -- Concierge let us down as he told us that BART did not go to the Oracle Arena (Warriors game) when it actually does, so we ended up blowing money on a cab.Overall, a pretty poor experience, especially for a Hyatt. I'm guessing Hyatt feels they need to compete with the JW Marriott around the block so they call this a Grand Hyatt. Don't be fooled - this property barely deserves the Hyatt name let alone the Grand.",3-Jan-08,2
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Dec. 30 for one night and had a wonderful time! The hotel is conveniently located near Union Square and Chinatown. We got a room overlooking Macy's and Union Square. The room was spacious and the bathroom was large as well. The bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet. The hotel and valet staff was friendly and worked hard to make our stay pleasant. As a bonus, I thoroughly enjoyed the snow villages on display on three sides of the hotel lobby. We highly recommend the Grand Hyatt....can't think of anything negative about our stay there.",2-Jan-08,5
"Stayed at this hotel for our first year wedding anniversary. IT IS WAY OVER PRICED!! But the thing that pushed it over was the fact that we were overcharged for our stay, not once... BUT TWICE!!! Unacceptable if you ask me. Upon check-out we received our bill which charged us for an extra night that we did not stay, we approached the front desk who did take the charge off, but without apology. Now, more than 3 weeks later after staying in this hotel, a new charge appeared on my credit card for an additional $1200!!! How can you make a charge 3 weeks after checkout for $1200? We are extremeley upset by this and every time we call we are told that the ""accounting staff"" are all out of town for the holidays. I wish I could take back time and never have stayed here!",2-Jan-08,1
"We booked a stay during Christmas week. Although the desk clerk recommended a particular floor for our two rooms, for the view, the view was not what he promised. We later learned that he was in training. The second room was not ready until after 7 pm. Not very helpful to four weary travellers who had been awake since 3 am that day. The hotel manager on duty offered to comp us for one night, then, sensing our displeasure, offered to comp us two nights for both rooms - more than acceptable to me; but he didn't come through on the promise. The bill at checkout comped one room for one night. Later, after telephone tag, he comped each room for one night, and denied the offer to comp us for two.Food was average. Waitstaff at the restaurant (breakfasts only) was terrific. Rooms were also average. The TV worked but with fuzzy picture on most channels. Beds were very comfortable.The sliding glass door on one room was open when we arrived and required housekeeping to close it, as it was broken.We will NEVER stay there again. You should avoid this hotel.",31-Dec-07,2
This is not a Grand Hyatt. I was a little disappointed.Positives:- location is terrific- views are excellent- size is manageable- gym is solid- Employees were very professionalNegatives:- Regency Club lounge is tiny (we had to stand!). Food / Beverage choices are below standard. - Public areas are dark and old-fashioned,31-Dec-07,3
"Be prepared to wait in line at elevators for at least 5 minutes, crowds of people rushing about. We had to take the stairs from the 18th floor at one point, after waiting on an elevator for 10 minutes. This is No Grand Hyatt, its in need of a major renovation. Also, walls are paper thin, you can hear your neighbors talking in normal voices during times in the night. If you book on priceline, I wouldnt put in more than 50 a night, its about all its worth.",28-Dec-07,1
"My SO and I decided to stay here for Christmas Eve and Christmas just to relax and have a mini getaway from our apartment in the south bay. We booked through the hyatt website with a AAA discout that included full breakfast for two in the Grandviews restaurant/bar. The Grandviews is aptly named, located on the 36th floor of the hotel, it has an amazing and beautiful view of the bay and the city.Grandviews is worth visiting even if you aren't staying at the hotel.Our room was on the 17th floor and had a decent view of the bay through the tall buildings. The bed was very comfortable, with a down comforter and plenty of down pillows. The toiletries were adequate, nothing special and the shower was either a bit too hot or a bit too cold, the temperature control was difficut to tweak. However, the hot water never ran out, which is a plus.This hotel satisfied for our short stay and provided quite an excellent value in SF. I plan to stay again and again.",27-Dec-07,4
"We thougt we could not go wrong with the Grand Hyatt. Boy we were so wrong. We were given a room whose walls are so thin that we could hear every piece of conversation that was coming from the next room. We asked the front desk for a room move and the guest service agent told us nothing is available and to check back the next day. They made no attempt to assist us. The next day, I attempt to room move again but the guest service agent was again reluctant to assist us. She only room move us after I threaten to check out. There's mildew in the bathrooms for both rooms, cracked caulking and the lights don't work. On my last night, I was trying to retrieve my package from the Front desk. The guest service agent told me that he doesn't know where it is becuase it is not part of his job and to wait for the bellman to assist me. He would rather I wait 10 mins while he is sipping his starbucks coffee and talking to his fellow colleagues rather than making an effort to look for my package.",26-Dec-07,1
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for some Christmas shopping and a show at the Curran Theatre. Lots of great shopping around nearby Union Square and a short walk to the theatre. China town and the Ferry Building are also nearby. Unlike others, we found the concierge most pleasant and helpful. They were able to book a last minute dinner res at a great little bistro two blocks away. It was packed 20 minutes after we arrived. Staff was pleasent, available and most helpful.The room was quite pleasant, though not extraordinary. The bathroom was small but clean. The bed, however, was a 10...very comfortable.Views? We paid up for the bay view...and it was worth it, if you like views. The views from the top floor Grandviews resturante and lounge are magnificant. The food is...well, go there for a drink. This was our second stay and we were pleased with both visits.",19-Dec-07,4
"This is our third stay at the hotel, the first being shortly after it opened. We had a wonderful view on the 26th floor, of many of the gorgeous buildings in the City. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was clean, although there was paint peeling on the ceiling in the bathroom.My only problem was a noise that I could hear that sounded like a vibration in the ceiling near the door. I wanted to call the front desk, but at the time it was happening (late at night), I really didn't want to have the maintenance person in our room. My fault for not reporting it.The location of this hotel is great if you want to be near Union Square and all the great shopping!",14-Dec-07,4
"Imagine our distaste when we arrived at this hotel from the East Coast shortly after midnight local time only to find that the hotel had given away our room. Never mind that the room had not only been guaranteed with a credit card, but that card had already been charged for the entire stay. They did have a room we could stay in - with a roll-away bed. After much deliberation with the unaccommodating front desk person, a double room was finally found to put us up in for the evening.A king room was supposed to be found for us and our luggage automatically moved the next day. When we returned to the hotel around 1:00 p.m., this had not yet happened. Another less than pleasant exchange at the front desk yielded another double room! They were finally able to locate an available king room so we returned to our original room to retrieve our own bags and relocate to the king room. Overall, the hotel is average. There is nothing that stands out about this hotel to make it recommendable. Rooms were clean (minus the coffee pot which still had a half pot of coffee in it when we arrived.) Location was great for access to China Town, the Ferry Building and some excellent restaurants. A night-cap in the Grand View bar on the 36th floor was enjoyable. No bell-staff were available upon our arrival to assist with our bags, the door or direct us to check in. (Hopefully this was due to the arrival time but was still a surprise.) Linens and glass-ware in the rooms were kept to the bare minimum â€“ a surprise for a room set up to accommodate two people. We travel a lot and are realistic about hotels and our expectations. We are comfortable in Wingate Inn as well as 5-star hotels. If youâ€™re looking for service (friendly or otherwise), avoid this property. Iâ€™d say find a Sheraton or Marriott brand nearby. If youâ€™re looking for a clean hotel where youâ€™ll be left alone, this is the place. Based on this stay we will not return to this hotel and will not consider Hyatt as a top choice brand in other cities when choosing hotels in the future.",20-Nov-07,3
"Have stayed a lot of places in San Francisco, and finally found a keeper. Staff upon check-in was great - was using the kiosk, and the guy at the front desk said ""let me check that it gave you a good room"". My room was quiet, and an okay size for SF. The gym was smallish but VERY well-equipped, and no fee (unlike the Westin St. Francis). The concierge was very helpful, and her recs were similar to those on Chowhound (so she wasn't just sending me to the places that paid her best). The location is perfect for where I go to work, and would be wonderful for a tourist as well (close to Union Square and to some amazing restaurants). No time to wait for the shared-ride van, so thedoorman immediately got me a limo to the airport for the price of a cab ride.($45 flat) The Mark Hopkins had nicer bathrooms, but it was noisier & pricier, and the St. Francis nickels & dimes you plus their check-in line is appalling. Next trip to SF: Grand Hyatt",8-Nov-07,5
"I've stay here three times in the last month. Two out of the three times upon check-in I was informed that they were ""overbooked"" and asked whether I wanted a double bed room, a room with a pull-out bed, or a smoking king room. The double bed room has no work desk, and this past time I was stuck in a smoking king room. That's right, people still smoke. And I could tell. Horrible experience. Oh, and by the way, the furnishings are dated. Looked nice in 1990, I'm sure. But not today when flat screens and such are commonplace at competing hotels.",26-Oct-07,1
"We have just completed a 10 night stay at the Grand Hyatt in room 2508 and it was excellent. I was somewhat apprehensive after reading some of the mixed reviews on this site, but my apprehensions were completely unfounded. This was my third stay in SF; having previouslystayed at the nearby Sir Francis Drake and also the Hotel Boheme. TheGrand Hyatt stands head and shoulders above either of these two. Let me now respond to some of the issues previously raised, in no particular order.1. Room size. If our room was anything to go by, the rooms are quite simply palatial. Anyone who considers these rooms small has never stayed in a hotel in New York or indeed any of the so called ""boutique"" hotels around SF. 2. ""Tired"" decor. This is perhaps a fair criticism, but everything is relative here and the so-called ""tiredness"" would only be an issue if your baseline is 6 star Asian opulence. Perhaps ""dated"" would be a better word, as there is none of the shabbiness that the word 'tired' implies. And again, if you really want to see tired and dated, just go to anywhere that markets itself as boutique.3. The lobby. Yes, this is a shambles - the layout being dictated by the central core of elevators. But really, who cares.4. The staff - without exception were extremely polite, efficient, and helpful. Special mention must go to the concierges who we used shamelessly on at least a daily basis - nothing was too difficult for them and they were a goldmine of local knowledge. Most other hotel concierges simply hand you pamphlets. I can't praise them highly enough.And it must also be said that the location is excellent, the bed one of the most comfortable I have experienced and the hotel has a very good fitness centre. In terms of value for money - I can never score the rock-bottom rates like those offered on priceline; instead paying $239 a night. I considered this rate to still be good value for money, given the location of the hotel, the time of year and quality of service provided.I would have no hesitation in staying again.",20-Oct-07,5
"Let me start of by saying I think all hotels in SanFran are overpriced. We managed to get what I have been told is a great rate - 148/night for 3 nights. For that amount, Im used to staying in very nice hotel rooms. I would say our room was average. We did get a non smoking king size bed on the 15th floor, but our view was of the back of the tiffanys building. Others we talked to paid much much more. I had no real complaints - the check in process was smooth and our room was cleaned daily. We didnt see many bums outside, and those we did see were not intimidating or aggressive. The location was perfect for us, only 2 block from chinatown, and located directly in the middle of the upper end retail outlets. The girlfriend visited all of the shops nearby.. Car rental locations were about 5 block away, I had no problem finding them. The trolley is only a few blocks away, and the 30 bus takes you through chinatown to the fishermans wharf - that was quite convenient. Check out was simple, simply dial a number and you can leave. No extra charges were put on our bill.",10-Oct-07,4
"Stayed here for 2 days. The location is great, just off union square. We booked through priceline, was not expecting much. However, the check-in person was quick, efficient and smiling, and gave us high floor with a view of union square. The room itself was fine without being ""grand"". On another occasion, the reception was also able to change Canadian Dollars to US Dollars quickly, although they warned me that their rate is higher. Not a problem because I wanted only some change. Armed with reviews of this hotel, we made the right decision not to have a car during the stay. It is not needed. Took the BART train from the airport to the hotel. The MUNI Pass is a great way to see the city. While leaving, we walked to a car rental nearby and drove away to our next destination (San Jose). Be prepared to pay for everything. Internet access was $10. there is a charge if you want to print something. Didnt touch the minibar. However, they have automated machines to print out airline boarding passes (Free). Checkout can be done through these machines as well.In summary, the Grand Hyatt is a good hotel with a great location.",3-Oct-07,4
"Our stay at the Hyatt got off on the wrong foot when check-in told us that they could not put a roll away bed in our room even though this was part of the reservation. The excuse was that this was the national web site and it did not know that the rooms in the SF Hyatt are small and there is not space for a roll away bed. Pretty lame for an organization as sophisticated as the Hyatt, and really amounts to bait and switch. They did offer us a second room at a discount but this was more than the original reservation plus the surcharge for a roll away. The nickel and diming continued. Parking was $55 plus tax and tip. The internet connection was $9.95 per computer. My wife and I both travel with our own laptops. Although we decided to share one connection, it meant that one of us did not have our files and environment when answering email. There is also a surcharge for the exercise room.Our room was on the 32nd floor overlooking Union Square. The night we stayed, a construction crew was installing an awning for an exhibit, and we heard beams clanking and truck backup warnings all night.Hotel also needs a renovation. The bathroom ""featured"" a 5"" CRT television which when it was installed must have been the height of tech, but now looks more like a museum piece.On the positive side, the location is great and the 32nd floor Regency Club offered a good continental breakfast and the staff was cheerful and helpful.",16-Sep-07,3
"For first time visitors this was a perfect location, walking distance from many attractions and close to public transport links, including cable cars if you don't mind the long queue. The hotel was good but not outstanding. If you can get a high floor with an unobstructed view it makes a big difference. Excellent concierge service which directed us to some good restaurants, but one of the duty managers on reception clearly thought dealing with the customers was beneath his dignity.The in-house restaurant and adjoining bar have wonderful views, but the restaurant is too small when everyone wants breakfast, and in the evening the quality is below expectations at the price being charged. OK for arrival day when you don't want to go out again, but you can do so much better within comfortable walking distance.If you fly into SF don't bother with a car. Others have mentioned the cost of parking, and you simply don't need a car here. We rented one the day we left for Santa Barbara, and several rental agencies are in a street about five minutes walk from the hotel.",12-Sep-07,4
"The Grand Hyatt is what you think a big chain hotel in a big city will be; filled with business and tourist folks alike. This is no surprise either, the hotel's location is downtown,close to the financial hub for the suits, and for the fanny pack crowd, only blocks away from great shopping on Market or the odd smells of Chinatown. As with a majority of our personal travels, my wife and I secured a great rate using Priceline. Gotta love that William Shatner!!Our room was larger than what I expected of a major downtown hotel and it was clean. The bed wasn't ""heavenly"" or cloud-like, but I slept well and that's all I really need. The one mildly disturbing room feature were the paper thin walls. If you're a light sleeper, bringing ear plugs will remedy the situation.We didn't have car, so I can't tell you about parking. If you can avoid having to rent a car (i.e. you're staying in the city), do so. Parking in SF should be an Olympic sport; an EXPENSIVE Olympic sport performed only by those highly trained in the craft. Besides, SF is a great city to explore on foot and the Muni bus system and the BART (use it from SFO into the city) is one of the best public transportation systems in the country (relax, NYC yours is still the best). Oh yeah, and the California cable car line is about three blocks from the hotel. It will take you to within a block or two of the Ferry building and all it's restaurants and gourmet shops.I'd stay at this hotel again without question.",7-Sep-07,4
I had a great stay recently at the Grand Hyatt San Fran. The room was clean and spacious and the view was fantastic. The bed was comfortable and while the walls were a little thin - we slept well both nights of the stay. Highly recommend to travelers to the SF area.,4-Sep-07,4
"The room was very nice - though small. Bed was comfortable. We had a general view of the city from our room, not spectacular, but not looking a wall, either. We had a AAA package that included breakfast. Breakfast was very good and their dining area on the 36th floor has wonderful views. We were on the Regency Club level and had access to the lounge. It was nice - again, great views. It was also nice to be able to go in there and get bottled water (no charge) during the day and evening.It was not an ""amazing"" hotel experience, but it was nice and worked just fine for our vacation. It definitely was not a negative hotel experience. We wanted to stay in a good hotel in the downtown area at a ""reasonable"" price and I think we did that. I would stay here again.",31-Aug-07,4
"After recovering from knowing that valet parking will cost us $50 a day (you need valet if you want your car back to cruise around town, $30 across the street but no in/out priveleges), we were welcomed by a very friendly staff and helped by a friendly bell boy to our room. We have a room with 2 beds, very tight! The view overlooking Union Square was spectacular. I hate to admit, but after being in the room for an hour, I started to notice things that I would not expect for the price that we paid for. AC was not functioning properly. Chair upholstery very poor and bathroom tiles grungy (minor maintenance needed and probably affordable by a Hyatt), closet doors were pretty banged up, no microwaves, no refrigerators and the worst, couldn't get any sleep at night due to construction (jackhammering) until 11 at night. We wanted to check out the following day, only to find out that they will charge us for the day and $50 penalty charge for checking out early. It's the Grand Hyatt! We've stayed at cheaper places and had better quality of rooms. Staff was excellent though, from the very second you get there.Rooms were average. If it wasn't for the staff, I would give Grand Hyatt a lower rating.",30-Aug-07,3
"We came to SF to celebrate a friend's 4oth birthday and had a wonderful experience at the Grand Hyatt. The rooms were lovely and the beds were fantastic! Our room included two breakfasts per day and the hotel's restaurant and staff were great. One server offered to give us ""to go"" cups for our coffee after hearing us talking about going to a coffee shop on the way to Napa. The views from the rooms and the restaurant and bar are amazing. We would stay at the Hyatt again!",28-Aug-07,5
"My wife and I had a one night reservation to break up a leg of a Hawaii to Alaska flight. We made the reservation about a month in advance. Upon arrival at 8:30 p.m., we were told that the hotel had no King Bed (which we had reserved), and that my reservation was merely a ""preference"" which the hotel could decline to accommodate, and they could only give my wife and I double beds. They would not reduce my rate (I paid about $250) or do anything to make up the problem. Usually, if a hotel can't give you the room you reserved, they make some attempt to make it up, but not Hyatt.The rooms themselves were fairly roomy for San Francisco, and the service by the restaurant staff and bell attendants was very good. The Union Square location is also convenient. However, there are obviously better choices near Union Square.",26-Aug-07,2
"My husband and a colleage were heading to San Fran for a business trip, so I decided to tag along. We booked through priceline and got a rate of $120 a night for four nights. We arrived super late on Tuesday night/Wed morning and upon coming from Oakland airport, we went to the wrong Hyatt. There are two in San Fran, that are both very close to each other. Turns out we were staying at the Grand Hyatt, which is on Stockton Street, about half a block away from Union Square.Check-in was easy, and our room was on the 5th floor. The rooms are very nice, and have a iHome alarm clock where you can dock your ipod. I was dissappointed the first morning to see that although they had a coffee maker in the bathroom, the coffee to make it was in the mini-bar and cost $4! So I went to the mezzanine the first morning to get a small coffee and a bottle of water and it cost $5.50. Fine for business travelers who are expensing it, but I recommend going to Startbucks across the street, or getting bottles of water at Walgreens down the street (that is what I did).Otherwise, we did not eat at the hotel, but did go for drinks on Friday night at the Grandviews Lounge on the 36th floor, great views. I also used the fitness center, which was very well-equipped. Check out was very crowded, but we used the automatic check-out machines and took advantage of using the computer in the lobby that is there for you to print your boarding passes. Service at this hotel was also very good and you cannot beat the location.",25-Aug-07,4
"Stayed at the Hyatt on Union Square for my girlfriend birthday party and had a great time. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. One of the reasons I selected this hotel is it's location....close to everything. The Powell Street cable car that takes you to Fisherman's Wharf is just a block away. Chinatown is just a few blocks away and you are right in the middle of great Union Square shopping. Have stayed here before at Christmas time to do some shopping and enjoyed that experience also.I was able to book the rooms and get breakfast included, so be sure and check to see if they are still running that special. The breakfast is on the top floor and has a fantastic view of the city. They served eggs, potatoes, bacon, fresh fruit, pastries etc. a good way to start the day. At the end of the day we had drinks in the top floor bar and enjoyed this also.The room itself was fine. Comfortable beds, desks and big windows that give you a wonderful view of the San Francisco skyline. The only thing I didn't like was the parking fees.....$45 a night to park a car! I heard there is a public lot near by that charges $30 so you might want to check that out. The concierges were very helpful in assisting me plan my birthday party. They suggested restaurants and activities to make the event extra special. Thank you Grand Hyatt for a wonderful time!",24-Aug-07,5
"We stayed here for two nights; one using some Gold Passport points and the other on a AAA rate ($159/night, I think, including breakfast). It was a nice hotel in an excellent location, though not the typical San Francisco boutique hotel experience (i.e., no teddy bears, chintz, free wine, or woodburning fireplaces).Pros:-- Really nice room with giant windows that actually open up a little, good bed and a cute little ipod dock/radio (just make sure to dim it before bed or you could wake up in the middle of the night, bathed in a harsh and ghastly light trying to figure out how to turn it off without waking up your spouse. The answer is, cover it up with one of 8 or 10 pillows Hyatt strews on your bed and fix it in the morning). -- Awesome concierge crew -- helped with EVERYTHING, right down to boxing and taping our many wine purchases before our return flight.-- Great breakfast in a restaurant with 360 degree views and fantastic wait staff.Cons:-- Not much of a lobby, if you like lobbies.-- Bell staff a little clueless.-- Really expensive parking, but there are 2 or three other places that cost half as much right around the block.-- Our room was in a little corner very near to an elevator shaft (room 1424?). From the bathroom you could hear a loud and scary noise, like a phanom train, rushing by every few minutes. We probably should have changed rooms, but it wan't that loud in the bedroom and we slept soundly in the comfy beds.",23-Aug-07,4
"Fed Govt. traveler rate through there website of $140 a night 8/19-24 for king smoking room floors 3-17 (requested an upper floor smoking room with a view of the bay) I called from the airport and asked for options to get to the hotel, then took the BART from the airport for $5.30 to Powell St. station and walked the 4 blocks. Tried the express checkin but couldn't . The line was fast and as it turned out they had me on the 19th floor overlooking union square. The hotel is rectangular and only three or four rooms per floor overlook the square and bay so I was pleased to be in 1917 a handicapped room. It was slightly larger than the other room due to the huge bathroom. The reason I couldn't get do the express check-in was that they wanted to make sure I got the tax exempt forms for the room tax, which they provided me (didn't realize they existed). I had read some of the other reviews and the elevators (6) were good and fast 1-2 minutes. I was frequently out early and back by noon for period and wanted my room cleaned, so I always called housekeeping when I left and told them and the room was immediately cleaned. Great location (tons of top notch stores), Great View, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. When I went to the business center this PM to check-in for my flight tomorrow and print my boarding pass, she informed me they had a terminal and printer in the lobby where I could do it for free. A nice touch! You can also get a great professional massage, haircut, etc. next door at the St. Moritz Salon. All in all a wonderful stay.",22-Aug-07,5
"Came in to San Fran between two work weeks in Silicon Valley. I choosed Grand Hyatt mainly because it is right in the middle of the city, in Union Square.The hotel is tall and the lobby looks quite nice. Dark marble, which gives it a look of luxury and class. The valet parking worked excellent right outside the hotel and I checked in fast and smooth. The room was ok, not big, but neither small. The view was amazing with floor to ceiling windows, facing the business district of S.F.. A huge bed and a huge desk area, with a lounge chair, which I turned to face the window and just sat down with a drink and looked at the wonderful view from the 25th floor.The bathroom was not as nice as the rest of the room. It looked a bit old fashioned compared to the rest of the room. It was big but with old details and some old appliances to use, like the hair dryer.The sky restaurant and bar was good. The view makes up for the poor service in the bar, but the restaurant was much better and the breakfast bufÃ© was excellent, especially with the view of the Golden Gate and Alcatraz.Overall, it was a good hotel and room. Nothing spectacular and luxury, but better then average.",22-Aug-07,4
"The Hyatt's parking situation is attrocious. I drove around it twice trying to find a way to self-park. No dice. You have to pay them $45 per night to park the car. It costs a small fortune to park a car in most cities, but I don't like being forced to use valet. The room itself was OK in size and clean. Every morning riding down in the elevator I felt like I was on a local. We stopped at every floor. It became a joke amongst all of us one morning. The elevator was full--not room for a single new person--but we stopped at every floor from 30, down.",11-Aug-07,3
"First, our room was not ready when we arrived there at 4:30pm. We were told it would be ready soon, so we went to our kids' room and waited for an hour. Came back--still not ready. We were told, again, it would be ready soon, so we went out to our dinner, came back and--still not ready! Turns out the previous guest had not checked out yet! Well, they finally kick that person out, so we finally did get into our room. The gave us half-price on that room for the 3 days, but things got off to a shaky start.This is a BIG hotel, with lots of people working there, and staying there. I didn't like it--very impersonal--but what they do, I guess they do well. The concierges were helpful, and they basically tried to do a good job.Another day during our stay our room was not cleaned until--again--after we got back from dinner!It is a good location for SF sightseeing, and there are plenty of dinner and other places nearby.",10-Aug-07,3
"My wife and I spent four nights at this hotel at the start of a West Coast tour. We were not disappointed. We have reserved a Regency Room. These are located between 31st and 36th floors and permit access to the Regency Club lounge. That was great as complimentary breakfast was available every morning and soft drinks throughout the day. The views from there were spectacular.Our room was very comfortable, everything was clean and well stocked. The hotel location was the thing that really pleased my wife. After a day of sightseeing she (and her credit card) were within walking distance of Saks, Niemen Marcus and Macyâ€™s. In the evening, there were a variety of bars and restaurants close by. My big mistake â€“ and I should know better â€“ was to bring a car. It did nothing for 4 days except rack up a parking bill at the hotel. Including tax, the parking charge is about $50 per day. You have been warned!",7-Aug-07,4
"Got an excellent price for the normally otherwise expensive hotel. Nice rooms and good service. Union Square overall is a nice area, but I'd say the Hyatt by Fisherman's wharf might be better in terms of location. Union square is primarily all shopping of name brand stores. Powell street is close by though and you can get the cable car rides easily from this hotel and several bus lines close by as well if you don't rent a car. Hotel parking is expensive though, almost $50 for overnight and overall the location lacks in places to eat. Great hotel, not the greatest locatio!",28-Jul-07,5
"Got a great deal on Priceline so I can't really complain. The hotel is very nice and clean, the employees are great, and the location is decent if you are in San Francisco and want to be able to walk to the usual tourist sites. One problem if you're driving. You are trapped and forced to pay their ridiculous price for parking. It is Valet only and as of July 2007, the price is $49 a night with added fees bringing the total to park your car there -per night- to around $56 â€“ and this price is stated on their sign as being â€œfor hotel guests.â€ù If you get a great deal on Priceline or something and still want to drive, I suggest finding a public garage and at least pay half that.",23-Jul-07,4
"We enjoyed a 2 night stay at the hyatt on 3 & 4 july 07 and thoroughly recommend it. We received a very warm welcome on arrival at the hotel and a personal service continued throughout our stay which was very unexpected given the size of the hotel. We booked a very reasonable AAA discount rate for a 2 queen size bed room for 2 adults / 2 kids. The room overlooked the city on the 20th floor - not a great view but still a city view. the beds were extremely comfortable with lovely crisp cotton sheets and bedwear. Room could have been bigger but they are all standard size and actually it was ample for us. the bathroom is well equipped with a good shower albeit the tiling was a little beige and worn looking but the washbasin unit was marble. a weird feature was the coffee maker in the bathroom. it could hve fitted on the writing desk. however, the small screen tv in the bathroom was a great hit with our kids. The lounge bar on the 36th floor has wonderful views down to the Coit tower and the bay. the bar has a snack menu - burgers, pizzas etc. the burgers were excellent and not terribly expensive given the location at about $16. Drinks in the bar were likewise not too pricey $5 - $6 for a draft beer and $8 - $9 for a glass of wine. By the bottle is probably better value but given the tremendous view over San Fran u get it really is a small price to pay for the privilege. we had the great fortune of watching the 4th Fireworks from the lounge and we will never forget that experience. Lounge staff are great. we didn't try the restaurant but regretted that breakfast was not included in our rate, however, complimentary starbucks coffee is available in the morning in the lounge and complimentary San Fran Times delivered to the rooms. the fitness room looked like it would be very serviceable and we didnt visit the spa. The hotel is v centrally located in the centre of the shopping district and a 2 minute walk from Chinatown. The stroll through Chinatown takes you 10 minutes or so from the hotel into Little Italy so you will never be short of restaurant choices within easy walking distance from the hotel. The cable car terminus is just over 5 mins walk away. We took the rail link from the airport and got out at Powell i think where we had only a 3-5 minute walk to the hotel. Taxis to the Fishermans Wharf are about $7 so it really is a centrally located spot. we loved it and would definitely return.",19-Jul-07,5
The Grand Hyatt exceeded my expectations! We checked in early during a busy summer week without waiting in line. Staff was courteous and attentive. Place is clean and well maintained. Maid service was a little quircky. Views range from nice to outstanding. It's in a perfect central location that allowed us to stop in for breaks and unload purchases during our busy days. My teenagers loved the place. And there were no surcharges on my final bill!,13-Jul-07,5
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for two nights over a weekend. This hotel should be better than it is. It's got many of the pieces of what could be a great property, but it's still missing a couple of vital ones.The check-in process was brusque but efficient. I was offered an upgrade for an additional charge, declined, and went to my 12th floor room. The room was nicely appointed with a well-lit desk and a good work area. My room had a decent view of San Francisco, and noise was not a factor. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows.Furnishings in the room appeared to be relatively new, though there were holes in one of the sheets on my bed. Upon taking a shower the next morning I also found hair from the previous occupant(s) of the room. There was more than one hair in the bathtub, along with hair stuck to the back of the door. More unnerving than the lapse in cleanliness was the poor service that went along with it. My first call involved a front desk clerk who rushed to get me off the line rather than solve my problem. I was transferred to housekeeping, who promptly hung up on me after I asked to have extra attention paid to my room when next cleaned. When I called the front desk back and asked to speak to a manager I was told that there wasn't one on duty and that the clerk was not sure when there would be. Eventually housekeeping took care of the problem and I received a call from a member of housekeeping management apologizing for the problem (and offering a room change - which I declined). This was only after multiple calls on my part to resolve an issue which should have been dealt with in just one call. I've stayed in other 4-star properties in the area that offered much better consistency of cleanliness and service. In the future I would probably choose one of those as my first option. If I knew that the service and cleanliness at the Hyatt had risen to the level of those properties, however, I'd be willing to give it another shot.",9-Jul-07,3
"Perfect location on the northeastern side of Union Square, very safe, convenient to everything, near all the best shopping and close to Chinatown Gate. Everyone who worked there was most pleasant, friendly, and helpful.Rooms were very nice. The fitness center is one of the best I've ever seen at a hotel. My only complaint is that the breakfast room is much too small, resulting in waiting times of up to an hour for a table. This really threw off our plans every morning. They need to serve breakfast in a much larger room. The breakfast buffet itself is excellent, and the staff there are very very kind and friendly. The elevators also required quite a wait sometimes, as this is a very large hotel for only 5 or 6 elevators.Overall, we really enjoyed staying here, but don't pay extra for the breakfast- you'll waste a lot of time in the morning waiting for a table; just eat at any of the coffee shops or diners surrounding the hotel.",8-Jul-07,4
"Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest. Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty. Hair in sink and bath was off putting. Best measure of (lack of) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window. We were told someone would clean, then they would clean next day - needless to say it remained uncleaned on check out two days later. Location only good point.",6-Jul-07,3
"Stayed at Grand Hyatt, San Francisco for business meeting and visits with friends and family. Great location just off Union Square, extremely easy access to Downtown and Chinatown areas. Spent better part of time off from meeting wandering around shops.I went to graduate school in San Francisco and remember this hotel being other chains before it became the Grand Hyatt. It is a nice hotel. Staff is attentive, rooms ok. I arrived late and had the misfortune of getting a room on the fifth floor--very noisy with street noise and kind of claustrophobic, would definitely suggest an upper level room, as high as you can get. Request for a change was made and got a room on the 12 floor, which was much quieter and seemed bigger.Food was okay, ate 4 meals in hotel--nothing outstanding, but could be better considering you are in San Francisco! Another tip if you stay here--no self parking, valet is $43/ nite. You can save $20/nite by parking across the street at the Stockton/Sutter Public Parking garage, which is self parking. Parking in San Francisco is a nightmare.",5-Jul-07,4
"Loved the location, walked everywhere. Dbl bed rooms comfortable enough to accommodate 2 couples. Very nice staff, very clean rooms! Easy check in and check out! Just Great!",1-Jul-07,5
"Just back from a two night stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, June 23rd & 24th, 2007. I really have no complaints about this hotel. Valet parking at the entrance was always very convenient. Was able to call from the room to have the car at the door in 10 - 15 minutes. Pricey parking at $43.00 per night, plus tax, but not much more than the other garages around the hotel. I liked walking out the door and climbing right into the car each time we needed it. Front Desk staff was courteous and efficient. Our room on the 26th floor faced West and had a beautiful view. Room was clean, nicely sized with a King bed, large desk, two comfortable chairs, and adjustable end table. Furniture a bit dated and worn, but nothing I would complain about. Bathroom was roomy and clean, albeit again a bit dated but decent. Marble counter in bath. Excellent shower head with great pressure. Love the Portico bath products! Small, funky looking TV that I enjoyed watching the news while using the bathroom. Hallways were kept clean. Generally very quiet. No issue with noise. Elevators didn't have unreasonably long waits, usually under two minutes if that. Property was generally very well kept and felt upscale. Not top notch luxury, but very nice for what it is. Ate breakfast both mornings at the Grandview restaurant on the 36th floor. Most incredible views of the city. I suggest going up there just to have a look. Food was pricey as is usually the case at a hotel restaurant, but we wanted the convenience of being able to grab a quick bite as we had a busy schedule. Wait staff was very good and friendly. Food tasty, no complaints. We paid $159.00 for our room booking directly on the Hyatt website, using the Senior Citizen rate. I believe the AAA rate is the same. For the money it was an excellent value. I recommend this hotel and most likely will consider this hotel as a first option on future trips to San Francisco. Best point, location, location, location, and if you can get a high floor, the views.",26-Jun-07,5
"Stayed at the Hyatt 1 night on our tour of California.The hotel itself was of a high standard as you would expect,but from the moment we arrived I felt like money was falling through my hands with all the various ""add ons"".The valet parking was $40 a night.In the room the bottle of water on the side had a note on them saying $5 each.I went to use the internet in the lobby and was told ""its $5.95 for 15 minutes"".I went across the road to the Holiday inn...where its free!When we went out at night we had to wait 15 minutes for the car as the valet was so busy bringing eveybodys car up,me I would rather just park my own car,its a lot easier but I know in the US they seem to be big on the valet thing.We couldnt fault the location,and the beds were awesome,but I dont think I would stay here again as all the add ons put me off.",22-Jun-07,3
"Hotels which are part of large chains tend to be impersonal & homogenous, and in this sense the Grand Hyatt was no exception. However, that aside it's hard to criticise.The room was very spacious, the bed was huge & comfortable (stretch right out and still you can't touch the edges!) and everything in the room & bathroom worked as it should. I was on a lower floor, so there was no view and some noise from the street.Great views from the Restaurant & Bar, but both are quite expensive.Position is very good - central San Fran and close to Cable Car stop (don't wait at the terminus, just jump on at a stop a block or 2 along - no waiting).Concierge service was very helpful.Would stay here again, mainly because of the position.",19-Jun-07,4
"This hotel is in a great location, easy walk to all union square shopping, Chinatown. Very comfortable beds, fairly quiet rooms, 7th floor,can still hear loud street noises but room ventilation masks fairly well. Staff very friendly, lounge on 36th floor excellent view of the city, got rooms for $80 from priceline, would stay here again.",19-Jun-07,4
"We booked this hotel directly on their website and had reserved an executive room on their business floor. We were impressed with the deal we were able to get and were looking forward to staying here at the end of our relaxing holiday.Firstly, the location was fantastic. The hotel is conveniently located close to trams and bars. For the raging shopaholic, this place provides easy access to shopping in any direction you walk from this hotel. The location also allows it to have fantastic views of the city, with bay views on one side and Union Square on the other. Our room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The wardrobe was also sufficient with enough room for all our shopping. The bathroom is also equally roomy, with great amenities. Our room had fabulous views overlooking Union Square and also provided great views of the sunrise each morning. Since we booked an executive room, we had access to the business lounge for breakfast and early evening hors d'oeuvres. The lounge had great views of the bay, if you got in early enough to grab the seats. My only issue is that the lounge is not big enough for the number of people who have access to it. We were fortunate to get seats whenever we needed it, but there were a few people who were made to stand around waiting for a seat. The hors d'oeuvres in the evening were also great. You would also find substantial meals being supplied as well, such as pasta. So you would end up having a late dinner. Service in the lounge was the friendly and courteous. This was very well appreciated.Overall, this hotel is a class act. Great views, great rooms and wonderful staff.",17-Jun-07,4
I had read the reviews before my stay and I was expecting the worse ...... But it was fantastic!!!!!We upgraded to use the club facilities on the 32 floor and this proved to be a really good a short stroll from our room with a casual but hearty breakfast buffet with amazing views over the city and Bay. Also good for tasty nibbles early evening ahead of a big night out.I will definately stay there again.,15-Jun-07,5
"I stayed at this hotel June 7-10 for a conference. The location is great, a block to Union Square, approx. 7 blocks to the Metreon and Moscone convention center. The conference facilities were fine. There is a Starbucks across the street, a drug store a block away, and two private garages within 2 blocks of the hotel. Hotel parking is available too at $50/night. The room was not as nice as I had expected. The good part was it was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The bad part was after check in (exhausted and wanting a hot shower) I discovered hairs in the tub. The was also mildew on the soap holder. One phone call did not correct the problem promptly. A second phone call to the operator did bring a housekeeper to my room within 10 minutes to repeat the cleaning of the bathtub. The towels provided were nothing special. The bathroom was clearly in need of renovation but the water pressure was decent. Another good thing about the hotel is the exercise room - top of the line equipment, in good quantity and complimentary access. Another poor point for the hotel was the SLOW elevators. I don't know if some elevators were not working, if the hotel was full to capacity, just older and slower elevators - every time I had to wait more than usual for an elevator to arrive. I didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them. Overall a decent stay and great location. Just be on the lookout for dirty tubs!",12-Jun-07,3
"Stayed for a long weekend and was pleasantly surprised. Rooms were clean and beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The best part of this hotel is the concierge service. They give perfect directions to every tourist attraction and are very professional. Loved that they recommended a chartered shuttle back to the airport at a discounted rate. This is the perfect location - close to every mode of transportation, coffe shops, quaint bar a block away, awesome shopping all around. Tip: Buy the 3 day muni pass which is good for any muni bus, train or trolley. It will save you tons of money. Don't waste time on a cab.We were accidentally charged for the mini bar - because someone moved something - but when we pointed out the mistake they were quick to remove it from our bill. This is a beautiful hotel and deserves the four star rating. Will definitely recommend to all family and friends.",6-Jun-07,4
"My bf and I just returned from a Memorial weekend get-away in SF :)We cannot be any happier with the service that we received from the Grand Hyatt :STAFF- front desk's were quick and friendly; we asked for a room change due to the view and they happily assisted us- housekeeping's did a courtesy check before clocking out- Grandviews Restaurant's were incredibly warm and friendly, almost felt like home!FIRST ROOM- on the 24th floor facing the Financial District- nice king bed and clean- can't really say much since we asked for another room with better viewSECOND ROOM- on the 25th floor with full view of Coit Tower, TransAm Building, the Bay, Angel Island, etc. (see pics)- two full beds with 4 pillow EACH .. VERY comfy .. loved it!- was a bit dirty as the past guest left a bit of garbage in one of the drawers and his jeans in the back of the closet (okay ..)- loved the scent of the soap (citrusy!)We used our AAA card and was able to get a free upgrade and upgraded once again at the front desk (for $20 more) .. it's worth it!RESTAURANTAgain, with the AAA card, we received a free breakfast at the Grandview Restaurant - you can choose either the buffet or one entree from the menu. We opted for the buffet and had coffee/juice/smoothie served to us automatically. The buffet consisted of eggs, sausage, bacon, French toast, oatmeal, fruits, and cereal. All hit the spot after a late night of toursiy activities in the City! I just have to reiterate that the service was fantastic (esp Danny and Wendy)!This hotel doesn't have much frills (as compared to the W) but it's very much warm and homey .. the location is unbeatable!Definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in SF if you're a no-fuss and efficient kinda person!",28-May-07,5
"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a conference and had enough luck to get a room on the 16th floor facing the water. Couldn't see all of the bay, but did have a great view of Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid. Gorgeous during the day or at night. I loved the sliding glass doors, so I could take pictures from the window and get fresh air in the room. Also liked the nice big closet and good-sized bathroom. Wished I could have brought the bed and all it's pillows home with me.The concierge was helpful and the GrandViews bar at the top of the hotel was spectacular. OMG the views....sigh...Anyway, my only complaint was the room service. They were relatively fast, but the food wasn't great. And for all the great places nearby, I'd take the time to walk elsewhere.Nice hotel for sure, but glad my work picked up the $275 a night tab.",15-Apr-07,4
"I LOVE Hotwire! Grand Hyatt was not only a great deal, it was everything that it claimed to be in terms of being a customer favorite and having a wonderful location. Sometimes I have experienced a feeling of being put in a less than wonderful room (paranoia perhaps?) for my Hotwire purchase, but not here. Valet was expensive at $45, but was timely and nice to have. The room was nice and luxurious for the money.",10-Apr-07,5
"I just returned from a long weekend for Easter in San Fran. While I had a fantastic time touring this amazing city, the hotel experience was AWFUL. First, I'm not one of those picky travelers who complains about anything and everything. I travel frequently, US, Europe, Africa, Carribbean but I've NEVER had this bad of an experience and rarely ever felt the need to get online to write a bad review. But this, I had to let people know.First, just as the reviewer below me said - I also arrived late, and the hotel was dead. I had to wait a few minutes to see one front desk person show up finally. No bell person, nothing. So I figured ok, it's late, doesnt matter. She gave me my room info and I head up, with no offer of assistance or anything. As a single traveler, it definitely was the least welcoming hotel I've been to. I head up, and get into the room, it was just very plain and very dated. A little depressing frankly, but I figured I wouldn't stay in my room all day anyway. I decided to lock the door but in doing so, first I tried to open it and it wouldn't open at all!! I was locked in from the inside!!! I couldn't believe it. I tried and tried, nothing. So I called the desk, they sent a bell guy up and I had to SLIDE the card through the door for him to open door!!I'll make it short, because it really was incredulous. So they gave me another room: Change 1.The next days, I changed rooms THREE times. The shower wasn't working properly in the room I was moved in: the water was lukewarm atbest. The engineer couldn't fix it, so they sent me to another room. Change 2. I couldn't believe it. When I got to that room, I started taking a shower : and to my shock, same issue!!!! only this time, it was COLD - no hot water at all. The front desk guy apologized and said He guessed the engineer didn't check before moving me. I'm thinking, it's YOUR job to check, not his!!! So the guy says he has a great room with a better view of Union Square for me, and that the next morning, I should go up and get complimentary breakfast and ask for the manager, because he (the front desk guy) arranged for it personally. I just couldn't believe that all they offered me was lame breakfast!!!! for making me move three times in 2 days!!!!UNBELIEVABLE. So, left with NO choice I moved AGAIN. The next morning, I decided to collect on my ""complimentary breakfast"". I was impressed with the views from the restaurant and waited for the manager. She came, and after I told her the story, she had NO CLUE what I was on about!!!!! She said, do you remember the name fo the front desk person who told you you could have free breakfast??I couldn't believe it. She had to make calls - and still no one at the front desk that morning knew what I was on about. No complaint note on my room, NOTHING.So she says taht she's sorry, but she will have to put the breakfast on my tab until she can clear the story. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Enough said. I was so humiliated and furious!!! The breakfast, btw was awful (found a hair on the french toast and pointed it out to the manager, she didnt even apologize or offer me anythign in exchange) and I got billed $30 for the buffet. I headed back downstairs and told front desk to find the guy who said I could have the free breakfast, and that this was really just absurd. They said they would, looking at me like I was crazy instead of apologizing for putting me through that.I came back very late (because frankly I never wanted to even stay in my room, the rooms are SO dated and dreary). I went back to the front desk, and the actual assistant manager who had handled my complaint was there, and told another front desk guy to delete the charge from breakfast from my bill. BUT AT NO POINT did he even identify himself (I recognized him from the name tag), or apologize for NOT having told the breakfast manager, or ANYTHING. Just gave me such a snobby go-away look. And then they have the gall to ask if I wanted additional breakfast coupons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm going to end here. But suffice it to say, I will never ever ever stay at this hotel, or any other Grand Hyatt ever again. I am sure that if I were older and probably of another color, I would have received better treatment and definitely more than a free bkfast. At the very least, I should've been credited one night off my stay, for making me change rooms THREE times in 2 days and making me pay for a breakfast until they could figure out whether I had ""lied"" about it. And this is a four star hotel???? I had to CHASE them down to take the bfast off my bil!!!! The only positive was the location, but as the other reviewer said, there were MANY hotels with that convenience. I had a fantastic time in the bay area, but the hotel DID put a damper on my stay - truly cold staff and cold dated rooms. Never ever again.",9-Apr-07,1
"The Grand Hyatt in San Fran is an awesome hotel - big rooms, great bedding, fitness center on 6th floor. The view from the 36th floor bar is excellent - very cool. Expensive breakfast.",9-Apr-07,5
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for three nights during the first week in April, 2007. I was a little unsure of our choice after reading a few reviews, but I was really pleased. I have traveled quite a bit and have stayed at hotels in big cities before- mostly Chicago. The downside to staying in prime locations in the big cities is always the price. We did pay more than we usually like to for any hotel, but you can't beat the location. It was a 5-10 minute walk from Chinatown, public transit, and a million places to eat and shop. I LOVED the location!The hotel is older (not ancient by any means), but our room was very nice. Not shiny new, but nice. I was really impressed with the size of our room. It was quite spacious.The service in the hotel was excellent. I was really impressed with the concierge service. The ladies there gave us directions EVERYWHERE! We used the public transportation and found it very easy to get around with their help. They gave us good advice on places to eat, and even ordered a shuttle for our ride back to the airport. The front desk and housekeeping were equally friendly and helpful. I enjoyed our trip to San Francisco and would definitely recommend staying in this hotel in Union Square.",8-Apr-07,4
"Just returned from San Francisco & have to say Fantastic City!!The Grand Hyatt is currently rated 70 on here & would say thats about accurate, the one thing going for it as everyone agrees is location, although we did see many other hotels in & around Union Sq so it does have competition on that front, but after seeing Fishermans Wharf the more up market Union Sq area is in our opinion where you need to be stopping.First impressions of hotel on arrival is that the entrance is on the road & for a big hotel does not have a great frontage. We checked in late so reception was quiet & quick but cosidering these two points we where not asked if we needed any assistance with our two large cases & ended up taking them to our rooms ourselves.We decided to pre book a Regency Club room, as we thought a better room & extra touches would be nice however this turned out to be dissapointing although we cant comment on a standard room we are sure there could be little difference between the two, we found our club room average at best .The bathroom was very dated & room drab in decor,just looks like it needed a makeover best thing about it was the bed, big & very comfortable!The club lounge also seemed pointless the only thing we gained for our extra $50 each a night was continental breakfast & a few complimentary soft drinks no personal concierge infact all the staff except one chap were pretty impersonal you were also expected to pay for alcoholic beverages between 5 & 7 pmwhich we were initially led to believe from Expedia were going to be free! Best thing about the club lounge is the elevated view which is awesome this is what we think you are may be paying for so be warned,unless you want a stunning view of the city while having breakfast dont bother with Regency Club.We think that if we had gone for the standard room option it would have been reasonable value for an ageing hotel but we did expect a bit more from Hyatt & when returning we will be checking out some other hotels as San Francisco has plenty.",21-Mar-07,2
"My girlfriend and I visited the Grand Hyatt as part of our trip in Southern California and picked the hotel due to its wonderful location. It is within walking distance of Union Square and its shopping area, Chinatown and the cable cars.We did not use the parking services amounting to $ 43,-/night as the hotel itself is easily reachable by public transportation (BART from the airport, MUNI buses and the cable cars).Our room at the 18th floor had a great view of Union Square. The room was in good shape and came with a comfortable bed and good bathroom. However, the room was a little small. Despite being on the 18th floor, we heard some noise from Union Square and streets below. This noise was never disturbing.Had breakfast and dinner at the Grandviews restaurant once. The views of San Francisco are fantastic as the restaurant is located on the 36th floor. However, breakfast and dining are pricey. As an alternative, close to the hotel are a lot of other restaurants (less pricy). There are also several supermarkets close to the hotel for candy or bottled water.Staff was very friendly and helpful.Two negatives: The hotel is a big convention hotel and just the overall ambiance seems to be focussed on conventions and the hotel itself seems just a bit dated.Overall a great stay and I would stay there again.",17-Mar-07,4
"Booked the Grand Hyatt on Priceline for a great price and was put in a suite with an incredible view of the Bay and San Franciso. We were put on a concierge floor so got a wonderful free breakfast every morning. The service was excellent, directions, maps, all we asked for. The location is absolutely perfect, amenities really nice. A wonderful stay.",13-Mar-07,5
"What a location! Our room had a small balcony directly above Union Square- wow! We took the train from the airport- the hotel was a short three block walk. The staff was friendly. Problems-the in-room internet keyboard didn't work correctly- they refunded, the cordless phone was slightly broken, the furniture needed updating, and the 5"" TV in the bathroom got a few channels and seemed like it was purchased in the 50's. Most important- THE BED WAS AMAZING, I want to buy one, and location, location, location. ALso, being a tall tower, I could find the hotel from all over town. I paid $85 on Priceline for the room. $85!!!! That's amazing! enjoy",2-Mar-07,4
"We stayed for a one day getaway at the Grand Hyatt. It is one of our favorites for exploring the city. The location is in the heart of the city. Great Union Square shopping, steps from the cable car turnaround, Chinatown, live theatre, and great restaurants. We were upgraded to a bay view room and enjoyed a bottle of wine while watching the city light up at the end of the day. Of course you will hear some noise from the city. Your smack dab in the middle of it! The bed is extremely comfortable and the hotel provides nice ammenities in the bathroom too. The room isn't large but still adequate. It is our favorite place to stay for a last minute getaway!",24-Feb-07,5
"Get a high floor room by joining Hyatt's free Gold Passport, and you'll love the view of all of San Francisco from the spacious room, well appointed, but it's about time to get furniture redone, replace the old Tv in room and bathroom tv. High quality bed and linens, fabulous concierge service downstairs helped with food, travel suggestions. When we had problems with key working, I asked and got satisfaction from the Mgr on duty. Excellent location 1 blk from Union Sq that has totally free wifi internet, whereas hotel charges $ 12 a day with no free areas other than 15 min in business ctr. Top floor eaterie is so so in food, pricey.",20-Feb-07,4
"I only stayed at the Grand Hyatt for one night on business. I got a $110/night rate on Priceline. I bid in the Union Square East- Embarcadero area for a 4-star hotel.A cab ride from the airport is about $40 dollars. With the high price of valet ($43/day)...I ended up just taking cabs instead of renting a car. I feel like I saved money and it was easier than trying to drive around the city. The cabs are plentiful in front of the hotel. My flight left early in the morning (6AM). I called the front desk about 10 minutes before I was to leave. He wasn't sure if he was going to be able to get a cab in time and had called a secondary car service that was basically the same price. I was impressed that had a back-up plan.I checked in around 1PM and my king bed room wasn't ready. I didn't have to time to wait so I opted for a room with two double beds on the 10th floor. My room faced the front of the hotel. I didn't think the view was very good. The view from the restaurant on the 36th floor faces another direction and it was very nice. Try for something facing that way! The rooms are on the small side, but typical for a city hotel. The room was very clean and I really liked the Portico bath products. There is a small TV in the bathroom, but it was rather old and I never did get it to work. The wireless worked great and is TMobile ($9.99/day). It is nice if you are around another TMobile site before the 24 hours expires because you can still log on with your hotel day pass (I was still able to log on at the airport in the Admirals Club.)I had dinner in the bar area of the restaurant. I must recommend the shrimp cocktail appetizer. It isn't your typical shrimp cocktail, but it was REALLY GOOD. It doesn't look like much, but when you taste it...you will be glad you ordered it. They also have a decent wine list. The view is very nice and worth at least meeting friends up there for a drink. The food was expensive as you would expect in a downtown hotel. I also ordered lunch from room service and it was very prompt. The banana split was very yummy as well. :)The location is really is great if you are a shopper. Every store you can imagine is within a few blocks. I know there were restaurants in the area, but nothing that really interested me enough to walk in the rain. If I had been staying longer I would have wanted to take a cab to the mission district, etc.If you are in the area and you can get a good price, it is certainly a nice hotel and was set up nicely for a business traveler.",18-Feb-07,4
"Outstanding staff! We were there with our two children for New Years. The manager on duty was FANTASTIC! She was attentive, we got all that we had asked and more! I am just a gold passport member, not even a high level one. The hotel was sold out. She upgraded us to a beautiful suite.It was clean, comfortable, the view was fantastic. I travel to many marriotts and to many hiltons for business, this was for pleasure. The service, food, and staff, were a step above what I have come to expect at most places. I am a silver member with both Hilton and Marriott and do not get the wonderful treatment that this hotel gave us for our stay! Cheers to the managment!",15-Feb-07,5
"This place was great. We stayed on a high floor, and had a great view to the Transamerica Pyramid and down to the Financial District. Everyone was helpful, and the place was clean and tidy. Everything was as expected for this kind of hotel and the price. Would definately stay here again",11-Feb-07,4
"We stay at this hotel often when we visit friends and family in the area and it is still terrific. As other people have noted, the lower rooms don't have the great views the upper floors do, but the rooms are all still large (by Union Square standards) and clean. Everyone from the front desk, the concierge, the maid service and valet -- is always polite and prompt to take care of our many requests (we travel a lot and tend to be picky). The location is great. For shoppers, Union Square is paradise. The main entrance to Chinatown is a short 2 blocks walk away. North Beach is a 10 minute cab ride, F'sherman's Wharf and Pacific Heights are about 15 min by cab. The Ferry Bldg with its fabulous new weekend market is about 5 mins away. There are also a variety of public transportation options at Union Square. What's the only downside? You don't need a car if you're just touring San Francisco (the public transportation is fabulous), but if you have one (we visit outside the city) parking is OUTRAGEOUS all over San Francisco. Valet at the hotel was $42 a day (ouch!)",26-Jan-07,5
"My daughter and I spent the night and did some shopping in Union Square a few weeks before Christmas. We were on a high floor (22, I think) and our room overlooked Union Square with all its Christmas lights--a fantastic view. The only problem was that the music (drum beats!) from the square went on until way past midnight and the noise carried all the way up to our floor. It was miserable trying to fall asleep. Other than that, we liked our room--not too small by SF standards, very comfortable beds and pillows, and an adequate bathroom. It's true that you can't beat the location--just think twice about overlooking Union Square if you're at all noise-sensitive.",4-Jan-07,4
"We stayed here New Year's Eve weekend and got an excellent rate given the capacity and prices around the city. The Good:We were given free full breakfast vouchers for each day due to being AAA members. Excellent breakfast--either buffet or off the menu. Nice room, nice view--nothing special but clean and everything we needed. Excellent desk service and extra security during the partying time.The Bad:Service at the top-floor lounge was terrible. Yes, every table was taken (expect for some reserved), leaving about 16 tables of 2-4 people with two servers, a busser/expediter, and bartender. Hard to get a napkin, let alone a drink.The Ugly:We were in a connecting room--our first one. The couple in the room next door had a....hmm...VERY good time on New Year's Eve night. Just after midnight we heard every moan and pant--EVERY one! Sorry to be nasty but it was so. Definitely will not be staying in such a room ever again and plan to go back to the Argonaut--our favorite hotel in S.F.",2-Jan-07,2
"My husband and I stayed here the other night and we're still recovering from the lack of sleep. We reserved a deluxe room and after trying to enter the wrong room (front desk error), we finally entered our abode for the evening. Once inside, I wondered what a non-deluxe room must look like. There was nothing deluxe about the shoebox we checked into. It was very small, with a King size bed, a media armoire, a desk and a couple of chairs and lamps crammed into it. Pretty standard. Anyway, it would do. The problem occurred later when we came back from dinner past midnight and were looking forward to some serious shut eye. ALL NIGHT LONG there was this hideous creaking sound coming out of the ceiling. It was like living under a pacing 300 pound giant. I tossed. I turned. I turned on the TV to drown out the horrible noise. I piled pillows over my head. Finally, at 3:49 AM I gave up and just turned the lights on and started checking my e-mail. We ended up checking out at 9:00 AM so I could get home and take a nap instead of hanging out in the city for a few hours. There is nothing horribly bad about the Hyatt (except for that creaking) but there's nothing really great about it either. I'll definitely opt for other digs next time we visit.",28-Dec-06,2
"I stayed with my family (hubbie & 9 yr old) 12/22-12/24.I ended up finding a fantastic rate of $103.20 a nite which included breakfast for 2 each day. I asked for a Regency Blun room but none were available so I asked for Regency club access and received that for an extra $25 a day (BTW I ended up not getting charged for this perk); I feel it is well worth it. The Regency Club is on the 32nd floor and is open till 9pm at night. The RC provides a nice continental breakfast spread (cereal, fruit, toast, yougurt, oatmeal granola) + a nice happy hour spread (hot snacks mix fruit); you can get water, coffee, tea, hot choc, sodas all day; happy hour drinks cost $4 for beer, wine etc. I got up early every morning; took my newspaper and had coffee and enjoyed the wonderful view of the bay. This is a nice option that people should be aware of; if you wanted to take items back to your room no problem, the staff even provided traysThe room was on the 14th floor and was very basic; lacking in bathroom amenties that I would expect from the Hyatt (no qtips, cotton balls etc). The coffee for the in-room coffeemaker was in the hospitality fridge; which you can not use for personal items you must request a fridge from housekeeping. The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. I do want to address the Frebeze smell; I did smell a perfumey smell when I got off the evalator on each floor; the smell did go away once I entered my room or the RC. It is there for those that are sensitive to such scent.I recommend parking on the corner garage Stockton/Sutter Street; as valet is $40 + tax a day. The lobby is quite grand with an oriental feel since the hotel is so close to Chinatown.The lobby window; had a cute Christmas village lit up.I recommend Uncle Vito's pizza; they have a yummy house salad and the best pizza.We ate only one time for breakfast at the hotel; the breakfast buffet looked good; I don't care for buffets too much and ordered off of the menu as did my hubby and child; everything was delicious. We ate at Lefty O'Douls for breakfast which I recommend for a cheap breakfast and to go have a drink.There is a piano singer that had the place rolling on Friday night and they serve a nice Irish coffee if you go for that type of drink.I would have given this hotel a higher except for the amenties faux pax; this is a GRAND HYATT and those bathroom amenties should be standard.",27-Dec-06,4
"I visit San Francisco about two or three times a year and have done so for the past ten years. However, I have never used Priceline until this past visit and what a bummer that I only tried it now!!! I paid litle more than what one would pay for a one or two star hotel in San Francisco! Anyway, on to the review of this hotel. I had stayed here many years ago and had enjoyed it very much. But it seems as though prices had crept up over the years and I found myself staying more and more at the Argonaut which is an incredible hotel for the price and location.We arrived in the morning and weren't sure if the Hyatt would be able to check us in early but asked anyway. They told us the rooms were being cleaned and to come back in about an hour (this was 8am). No problem, went around the corner to Sears Coffee Shop and came back. No problem, got ourselves a room! The room was not large but had more than enough room for my family of three. I admit that the view was non existant but I wasn't going to argue with the price I was paying. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also very nice.The most pleasant surprise during our stay was the housecleaning staff. Each and every one of them was pleasant and would acknowledge you everytime you saw them. By this I don't mean just a ""hello"" and then go away but a real conversaion. Maybe not a long one but, ""how are you today? Is everything alright?"". They made us feel like they really cared about our well being. They were more than happy to provide us with anything we needed. The location of this hotel can't be beat, you're basically just steps away from Union Square and I mean steps! You can walk to nearly everything and the Cable Car stop is just a block away. If you plan on using the cable car for transportation get yourself a city pass. It'll allow you unlimited use of the Muni System plus give you a bargain to a bunch of other attractions. I think the Cable Car is much to expensive at $5 per ride nowadays. Looks like I'll be staying at the Grand Hyatt more often from now on!",26-Dec-06,5
"I stayed at this hotel for 4 days between 12/7 and 12/10. Upon checking out I reconfirmed that the following weekend 12/16 to 12/18 I also had GUARANTEED FOR LATE ARRIVAL reservations for TWO rooms and would be back. Upon arrival on the 16th we were told our rooms had been given away. At ll:30 at night, during the Christmas season, there is very little available in San Francisco. We were told by the manager that had we not shown up we still would have been charged for the rooms even though they were given away. The Hyatt did, to their credit, ended up putting us up in another hotel for the evening, but wanted us to return to the Hyatt for the second night of our stay! Paying for the first night of our stay does not excuse the fact that a guarantee for late arrival reservation for two rooms was given away. Travelers do not always arrive at the convenience of a hotel, therefore, the guranteed for late arrival is to be their assurance of a room. I feel this kind of treatment shows poorly for the BIG Hyatt corporation. Also, there were charges put onto my charge for the orginal 4 days that were for services we did not use. Hyatt has lost a long standing Passport member and never again will I recommend to anyone to stay at a Hyatt. We have been treated poorly, in the past, with Hyatt Hotels and have always given them another chance. They are a big company and really don't care where their dollars come from as long as they keep pouring in. They need to clean up their mediocre rooms and their mediocre attitude. Hyatt is not what Hyatt use to stand for.",25-Dec-06,1
i stayed at the grand hyatt for 5 nights during December 2006. The location was great - right in the heart of union square and close to public transport. The rooms were spacious and clean however the service left a lot to be desired. We arrived at 2pm and were told that our room would not be ready for another 2 hours. would definitely stay there again for the fabulous location.,17-Dec-06,4
"Visiting San Fran the weekend before Thanksgiving has become something of a regular thing in recent years and I've enjoyed the chance to stay at a number of high quality downtown properties in the process. I'm happy to report that the Grand Hyatt at Union Square provided a comfortable and welcoming ""home base"" for my partner and I during this year's stop (Nov 2006) in the city by bay. Full disclosure: I accompanied a travel industry professsional who obtained a terrific rate by booking our room months in advance and talking directly with the hotel. Still, our room rate was right in line with other excellent rates easily obtainable via Priceline and Hotwire for this same property. Our request for an upper level floor was happily accomodated by the friendly and professional young lady at the reservation counter at check in. We wound up with a west-facing room on the 30th floor that not only towered over all nearby buildings, but also offered a terrific side view of the newly-lit Christmas Tree on Union Square...and more than one gorgeous sunset The guestroom and bathroom were fairly standard in decor and size. Furnishings were reasonably tasteful and comfortable, too. The only headscratcher was one floorlamp's wobbly, uneven lampshade. Such an obvious candidate for replacement, it wrongfully lent the room a slightly shabby first impression -- one that fortunately did not last. At the opposite end of the spectrum (in a good way) was the room's absolutely outstanding bed: snowy white, pillow-topped perfection, arranged with a mountain of pillows and an attracitve contemporary-patterned throw. This room's king-sized model appeared to be very new and it was as good if not better than any of the ""heavenly"" beds touted by some of the Hyatt's 4 and 5 star competitors; Slept great!The public areas in the hotel may not be opulent, but they are tasteful. And given the Hyatt's close promimity to so very many San Francisco downtown attractions, its unlikely that you'll be lingering much at the hotel anyway. A nod to the staff: Everyone that we encountered -- from housekeepers in the hall, to the kindly desk help, to the courteous doormen and porters -- was warm, genuine and helpful during our numerous comings and goings to see the city.In all, a very positive experience. If you're looking for a prime hotel location near Union Square with the potential of an outstanding view, the certainty of a comfortable bed, and a friendly staff to welcome you - look no further. We'll certainly consider the Grand Hyatt when booking future accomodation in San Francisco.",30-Nov-06,4
"I don't know what everybody is complaining about! The hotel was fabulous and an amazing value and that is coming from a hotel snob! It was very easy to find (not sure about those people that couldn't find it, its absolutely huge and well marked). It had a luxurious lobby, nice restarants and a perfect location. Our standard king bedroom on the 9th floor was much larger than expected and had a wonderfully comfortable bed with very nice clean white linens and pillows. I'm not sure why people think the rooms are dark or cavelike because every room has floor to ceiling windows/doors that open to the fresh air. We were also so impressed by their gym. We looked forward to working out each morning with their state of the art equipment , headphones and peppermint scented towels. It is geared toward business travlers but so what, that means cheaper rates on the weekend and we still enjoy the perks of wireless internet and lots of great amenities. But I don't mind all the other complainers because that means more availability for my next visit. Can't wait to come back.!",15-Nov-06,4
The location is what makes this hotel worthwhile with easy access to Union Square and Chinatown. Our limited interaction with staff on check-in was pleasant and efficient. Room was of average cleanliness and with a very limited cable selection. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. Free newspaper in the morning was provided. Elevator was slow at times with large crowds waiting to get off and on. We parked at the stockton sutter garage- paid 26 dollars total for the weekend.,14-Nov-06,3
"Me and my fiance changed to the Grand Hyatt from Westin St Francis after our horrible experience there last Sept. We stayed at the Grand Club Floor guest room which was very clean, nice and well equipped. The view was also impacable (see picture). The Grand Club lounge was very comfortable and useful to us. Though the check in process was a little slow, the front office staff (Reception, Bell, Doorman) were all very friendly and helpful. I was also surprised to see that there were luggage lying around the lobby unattended (see picture). My relative's handbag was stolen at the lobby of St Francis during the same trip so I didn't think SF is a particularly safe place to be leaving luggage around like that. The location of Grand Hyatt was also VERY convenient, just right next to the Union Square. In conclusion, for all those who are used to the 5* international hotel chain standard (esp for business travellers), Grand Hyatt SF is up to par. The location is superb and quality of the room & service are worth the money paying for.",6-Nov-06,4
I had two rooms because the first one reeked of cig smoke so bad I couldn't sleep. I was embarassed to call for a room change late at night but the smell was soooooooooo terrible. Front desk was speedy with my move request so I have nothing negative about the service. Everything in the old room and the new room was dark brown - felt like I was in cave. I craved sunshine and fresh air and was suprised that the days in SF provided both during my stay. Excellent location makes up for the cave rooms. I would stay here again IF I had to. Really don't like rooms where windows can't open even a little bit.,5-Nov-06,2
"San Francisco was the first stop on our West Coast tour and the Grand Hyatt proved to be a great choice for us. We had a room high up with fantastic views to the South and over-looking Union Square (we also arrived at the end of Fleet Week so had a great air display as we got settled in). The Hyatt beds were really comfy, the rooms were clean, the concierge was helpful and knowledgeable, and the location was ideal - pretty much all we needed. We never really eat at hotels and we actually found the walk through Chinatown and into the Italian area of North Beach (around Columbus Ave area) pretty simple. We ate at a decent place in Chinatown and also a couple of nice places in North Beach and also ate right near the hotel at Morton's steak house which was excellent.The hotel is also well located for the cable car which runs up the hill (Powell St) from Market St and if you jump on here you avoid the queues at the bottom. This takes you up to the top of Lombard St (crooked) and all the way to Fisherman's Wharf.By the way - hire bikes and cycle along coast and over the bridge to Sausalito (well worth it - you can always get ferry back).",1-Nov-06,4
"Location, location, location. This Hotel is in the heart of everything a couple needs for their shopping and tourist attraction get away! We stayed 4 days and found the room to be clean and our bed awesome. The concierge staff were helpful and great with all their suggestions, giving us some great San Francisco restaurants, the ones that the locals' use!For a big city with noise and action, the Grand is great and is what is to be expected. Close to all types of great shopping and tourist attractions, the bonus is you can walk to alot of these locations, and or use cable cars and other public transportation which is clean and easy to use. After a long day and night out coming back to a great bed in your room is the bonus! We will definitely stay in this location again!!Great little Japanese Restaurant 2 blocks away on Mason called Akiko! Great food and cheap! Great little Italian Rome style restaurant used by the locals in North Beach called ""Ideale"" absolutely fabulous! Recommended by the hotel Concierge!",31-Oct-06,5
The Grand Hyatt is a great hotel but maybe a little pricey. We stayed for two nights in October of 2006 and had a great time. The location was awesome and we enjoyed walking to Union Square and all the shops. The hotel was completely sold out but they seemed to be able to handle that number of people comfortably. Parking was out of control at $43 per night when other hotels in the area charge less than $30. Overall we had a great time and the staff was very nice to us on our special weekend away from home.,29-Oct-06,4
"Positives: Shopping -- upscale department stores and designer boutiques on practically every block. And an all-night Walgreen's right up the street. Location -- close to many picturesque neighborhoods, including Nob Hill, Chinatown, North Beach, and even Fisherman's Wharf. View: great views from upper floors and the 36th floor hotel restaurant/bar facing the bay. Concierge: Excellent service from the concierge staff. Negatives: Rooms -- lobby areas are attractive, but the rooms are smallish, the furniture worn, and everything is in need of an upgrade. Beds -- we had to request a bedboard for our too-soft pilow-top mattress, and a blanket for underneath the bottom sheet to prevent the sheet from coming off the bed at night. Housekeeping -- rooms are not well maintained; carpets are old and stained; the bathtub sported a layer of ground-in black scum. Food: the hotel food was really pretty bad; nearby restaurants tended to be pricey and the food was only so-so.",18-Oct-06,2
"Booked this hotel on priceline so got a good price. Had I paid full price I might have something to complain about but as it stands paying three star prices is about right for this hotel. The location couldn't be better and if you have no intention of hanging out in the room this is a great place to sleep...the bed, pillows and linens are very comfortable. The rooms themselves are a bit dinghy...moldy looking shower curtains, kind of dusty aroung the edges and the cleaning service is pretty minimal (is that febreze i smell?). Book on price line for under $125!!",3-Oct-06,3
Having read some discouraging reviews after booking this hotel we were pleasantly surprised. The room was excellent and view was stunning. Hotel staff were lovely and friendly plus there is a taxi queue just outside the hotel. It is central to the city and couldn't have wanted more. Much better than the Fisherman's Wharf area. Hotel bar on top floor has stunning views.Alcatraz is well worth a visit and the audio tour is excellent.Lori's Diners are great and Searle's is also good for breakfasts. Harris's steak restaurant is a lovely high class restaurant.,26-Sep-06,5
"We thought this was a nice hotel but did not really offer anything. Parking is crazzy expensive, $50 a day, and they charge you for everything in the room! (coffee, tea, etc) Hotel was in a great location, we were able to walk to everything (fisherman's dwarf, lombard st, shopping, etc.) but there was a serious lack of restauants closeby. =( we thought there were other nicer places we could have stayed that were more friendly. this was more a corporate hotel. bed was comfy but did not have fitted sheets, so annoying!",18-Sep-06,3
"The main attraction for this hotel is its location in Union Square. It is a very convenient and safe location in the city for sightseeing.The rooms were clean and comfortable and staff very helpful.On the downside our room on the 3rd floor looked out onto the street and was quite noisy( Poor sealing on the glazed windows) and the overall impression is that the decor is a bit dated and tired, a refit is surely due.Car parking at $50.74 per day is outrageous! fortunately the Sutter/Stockton garage is conveniently located across the street. If i remember the daily rate is approx $32.",6-Sep-06,4
"The only reason I booked this hotel was becuase of the rate of $143 over labor day weekend. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, and has some real nice city views. The lobby, and the rooms need some renovation, the furniture is kinda worn and outdated, but it is clean. The hotel has the new Hyatt Grand Beds, has to be one of the best beds I've slept in. The fitness center is a decent size with new equipment. I thought the service was warm, and professional which I find rare at these large touristy hotels. In the end this is a large outdated tourist hotel in the heart of Union Square.",3-Sep-06,5
"Stayed here for two nights in Aug 2006. Room was on the 23rd floor. Not much of a view, but it didn't matter to me. What did matter was the room was spotless, the staff were five-star friendly & professional and the location was great! The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quiet. Although there was a noisy ice maker located next to my room, I didn't hear it at all once I got in and closed the door. It was no problem having a great night's sleep. Bathroom was just fine - LOVED the citrus/lavendar products they provided. Location was perfect for shopping, restaurants, etc. Highly recommend Sears Restaurant a block or two over - an old classic with great food, especially breakfast.",28-Aug-06,5
"I got this hotel at 165 per nite thru corporate arrangement. I thought it was a good buy coz the location is so close to China Town, Union Square and Cable Tram to Fisherman Wharf.The parking of 43 per nite was a killer but again, u get your car anytime you want and as many times as you want, no question asked.I was assigned a smoking room even tho I clearly stated I wanted a non smoking room. I was told the hotel was full that day and hence the assignment.Readers beware - the type of room you ask for (King or 2 Double) is a confirmed deal at the point of reservation but smoking/non-smoking room is not.Then again, the reception gladly switched me to a non smoking room on the next day and guess what, they did all the shifting while we were out - seamlessly!The smoking room was not that clean coz I could see ashes lying around. The non smoking room was in good shape.The beds were heavenly after a long day out. The water pressure at the shower was great and so was the overall conditon of the room.",10-Aug-06,4
"The location is the only thing this Hyatt has going for it. It is centrally located and it's easy to get around the city from there. But as far as the ammenities........it definately is not a 4 star hotel. The rooms are small and old.....tile chipped, rugs in need of replacement, etc. They give you a 5 cent coffee maker in room, but can't chip in the 2 cents for the coffee. The TV in the bathroom shouldn't be a selling point. It is stuck on a pole on the vanity and has a 5 inch screen. It is VERY noisy on the street side and we were 19 floors up. The housekeeping staff did okay, except they opened the door and came in twice while we were in the room...not real happy about that. I would not stay here again, especially for the money.",7-Aug-06,2
"This hotel has a fabulous location. It is within walking distance of all the Union Square shopping area and an easy walk to get on the cable cars. The room was in great shape, comfortable bed, good shower. However, I only stayed here with one other person and the room size was fine. But with more than two people, it could be a little cramped. We are AAA members, so we got a free breakfast every morning in the Grandviews restaurant. I thought this is one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever had. The eggs actually tasted normal, unlike other hotels. The views from the restaurant are awesome. FYI, the rooms may look like they have balconies, but they don't. The door only slides open about 4 inches and is for venitilation purposes only. Valet parking was expensive, I think it was $46 a day, but I hear that it is expensive at every hotel in SF. All in all, the hotel has a great location, friendly staff, and a comfortable room.",29-Jul-06,4
"This Hyatt has some negatives, but the positives outweigh the negatives.On the downside: we checked in early and asked for an upgraded room with a view. The request was graciously handled by the front desk, but the â€œviewâ€ù was of the huge concrete wall of the Embarcadero Center, the patio off the room was littered with cigarette butts, and one of the patio chairs had a broken seat. The upside: the request to change back to a normal room was handled nicely, and our new room, while looking out over Market Street, was excellent. This room looked to have been remodeled and it felt spacious. The air conditioning worked well (good to have as the temperature was 90 degrees during our visit).Two more negatives. The bathroom towels are not new and luxioruous. They seemed quite worn in fact. And the hotel itself seems just a bit dated. It is a big convention type of hotel and just the overall ambiance seems a bit umm, err, convention-y. Not that bad however.Everything else about this hotel is great. The staff is excellent. The location is a slam dunk. You can take BART from the airport, exit at the Embarcadero station and walk two blocks north to the hotel. Once there, the cable car line starts right outside the hotel, the Ferry Building is across the street- great place for lunch or to take the ferry over to Sausalito. Union square is about an easy eight block walk, or Chinatown is about four blocks away and Coit Tower is about ten blocks down the street. The Emarcadero Center has some shopping and a cineplex. You can jog dwon the embarcadero or walk up to the stadium to catch a game.Finally, the hotel has done the smartest thing I have seen to date. At the front desk they have set up a computer and a printer and you can do online check-in and print out your boarding passes. Someone is thinking!Overall, this hotel worked out really well for my daughter and I.",22-Jul-06,4
"My husband and I travel to San Francisco for business several times a year, and the Grand Hyatt on Union Square is our first choice, even though there are plenty of lovely boutique hotels all over the city. Rooms are very spacious and clean, if a bit homogenous (but that's to be expected at a larger hotel). So, they don't break any design barriers, but furnishings are attractive and up to date (and beds/pillows are comfy -- so important). I love having the sliding glass door with faux balcony, especially if you get a view of Union Square below. Mostly, it's being able to get that nice fresh air coming in and hearing the clang of the cable cars in the distance. The front desk staff is very accommodating, the concierge gave us some really good dining tips (as a former sf resident and closet food snob, I was prepared to not be impressed by her recommendations... and was very pleasantly surprised), and the doormen are always there to help. But mainly, we love the location! In the morning, skip starbucks and get your latte and yummy pastry at Rulli's, located on union square, just steps from the hotel. What a treat, and it's a fun place for a little glass of wine later in the day (especially if the sun is out). The shopping is superb, from Williams Sonoma around the corner, to Macys and Saks etc. etc. And, theaters and some great restaurants are all within walking distance. We always make a pilgrimage to Kuleto's for Italian food, and love that we can be there in five minutes or less from our hotel. If we can't get in anywhere (because we're always trying to make reservations too late), we'll jump on a cable car (1 block away) to Ghirardelli Square (make sure you get the right one; don't take the line to fisherman's wharf, and try to sit/stand on the right side for best views) and go to McCormick & Schmick's. It is quite large (so always a good chance to get seated), has a good view from most tables, and can be counted on for fresh seafood. A touristy evening, but so much fun!Back to hotels, in contrast, one time we ended up at the Marriott because the Grand Hyatt was full, and we weren't nearly as happy. It was $60 more per night and the room was very bland. Add to that a huge, bustling, impersonal and (I thought) very garish lobby and nothing charming about the surrounding streets. Only good thing is if you're attending a show at Moscone convention ctr., it backs right up to it. A note on parking: we usually have our car with us, and parking at any hotel in the heart of SF is going to be expensive, so be prepared. At the Grand Hyatt, they're very quick to have our car ready when needed, and we've never had a problem with the valet service.",22-Jul-06,4
"My daughter and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt from 7/5 through 7/8 (Mom and daughter trip). The hotel has a wonderful location with the heart of Union Square around one corner, and Chinatown a short walk through a tunnel in the other direction. This was our first trip to San Francisco and the location seemed to be in a safe area, which was a main priority. Most of the staff was very friendly. We had breakfast one morning in the Grandview Restaurant. I thought the prices were quite high, $4.00 for a regular cup of coffee, making the Starbucks across the street look cheap (and refill was not offered), and $24.99 for the breakfast buffet. I had eggs Benedict ($16.00). The room was a little on the small side; however, it nice, clean, and had inviting comfortable beds (just as pictured on their web site). There was virtually no noise from the rooms on either side of us; however, the elevators sounded like someone was rolling large carts on the floor above us (we did quickly get used to the low rumbling). The problem I had was the street noise. We were on the 14th floor on the Stockton Street side and had loud street noise, and very loud construction noise, all night long on all three nights (yes, construction all night!)! I do not know how long the construction will last, or if it the sound is any better in other rooms (It might be a good question when checking in). On the last night, I found that it helped cut down on the street noise by pushing one of the chairs firmly against the center frame of the sliding glass doors. This tightened the seal and, although the construction noise was still pretty loud, the general street noise was less. The bathroom was fine. The only annoyance was that the water temperature in the shower was very difficult to regulate. It constantly went from hot to warm to cool.We are not used to public transportation, so I was a little intimidated by the MUNI buses at first. My daughter convinced me to just get on, and we felt comfortable with riding quite quickly. We basically tried to get on a bus that was headed the right direction, and just quickly asked the driver if he stopped near our intersection. We just paid the $1.50 cash each, and they automatically gave us a transfer ticket to get back on a bus within 90 minutes or so. We took the MUNI to the Warf, Golden Gate Park, and the Asian Art Museum (to avoid a few blocks of the Tenderloin).",10-Jul-06,4
"The hotel room itself was average, just another slightly cramped Hyatt, but the location was fabulous!!!!!!! I had a view of Union Square from my window, and thus was able to enjoy all the offerings in the area. The Macy's has a restaurant outdoors, down the street. Lots of fresh flower vendors in the area and the front desk loaned me a vase. Internet access in the room was not free ($10/day) nor wi-fi, but wi-fi is available elsewhere for free in the hotel lobby, I believe. Still, the concierges gave our conference a great list of restaurants. One of my friends who lives in San Fran agreed whole-heartedly with many of the recommendations on the list. Chinatown was a very short walk from the hotel and a multitude of public transit lines was available within 1-4 blocks. It was very easy to get to and from the Ferry Market building, one of my favorite places to hang in San Fran. The concierge was great with recommending stuff and giving out maps and directions efficiently. The front desk was reasonable as well. The bellmen were so charming and attentive, they caught me off-guard. It is a huge hotel and the view from the hotel bar is spectacular. It is a great conference location!",8-Jul-06,4
"Overall a very positive experience - stayed from 6/30 through 7/04. Room on the 20th floor with views of Union Square. Loved the fact that the sliding glass door - which was supposed to open only 4 inches for ventilation (per the sign on the door itself)- actually opened ALL the way! Which allowed me to enjoy the full seabreeze and sounds of SF... (of course this wouldn't be so cool if you had small kids in the room - which I didn't). Stayed solo in the room, so never felt cramped... bed very comfortable, plenty of pillows. Room was very clean and housecleaning did a fine job during my stay. Room was directly across from vending and ice machine, but very rarely heard it... only minor complaint would be the creaking noise that was persistent throughout the stay (apparently from the wind moving the building). Quickly got used to it, however, so never really bothered me. Never lost sleep over it but was a little wierd to hear at times. All employees I encountered were very friendly and courteous. Did not try the lounge or restauarnt as there are soooooo many dining opportunities nearby within a short walk. Muni subway just 3 blocks away, bus right outside of hotel. The location can not be beat. Would definately stay here again.",7-Jul-06,4
"I stayed at the Hyatt for a 4 day shopping/sightseeing trip and had a lovely time. I was a bit apprehensive at first since the reviews for this hotel were sort of lukewarm. The photos on the Hyatt site looked great, but then what hotel would post bad photos? I found a great packaged deal on Priceline (hotel + airfare) so I thought I'd give this place a shot. I was not disappointed!First, the hotel's location is fantastic- right smack dab in Union Square surrounded by a ton of shops. It's true that the Hyatt generally harbors businessmen/women and isn't exactly geared towards families or romantic honeymooners (not that families or honeymooners couldn't stay here as well), but for tourists looking for a nice place to crash after a long day of sightseeing and shopping, it makes for an excellent choice. I did tons of shopping and it was very nice to be able to pop in to my room, drop stuff off so I didn't have to lug my bags around everywhere, and quickly be out again. Lots and LOTS of shops around (Macy's, Cole Haan, LV, Niketown, Levis, etc.) Transporation is a few blocks away (cable cars, muni, bart, etc.) and Chinatown is just a 5 minute walk.Second, the rooms were quite nice. Nothing jaw-dropping, but clean and well appointed. I requested a non-smoking room on the highest floor possible and the very nice lady at check-in gave me one on the 29th floor (there are 36 floors total, club level from 31-34 and restaurant on 36)! I was happy to see that the rooms were indeed like the photos on the Hyatt site and the view was very nice (see photos). Each room has a tiny balcony (which you are not supposed to go out onto for safety reasons) with a sliding glass door. Beds were tall and super comfortable with plenty of pillows and a nice fluffy duvet. Bathroom was average with good counter space for all your hair and face products, ladies. They were a bit skimpy on the amenities, but if you need something other than shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion, just ask housekeeping and they can provide you with what you need. Coffee machine (with complimentary coffee), hair dryer, makeup mirror and small television (which I suppose you can watch while sitting on the john!) also located in the bathroom. Water pressure was decent (a sticky point for me at many hotels).I've read some reports of noise and thin walls, but didn't really experience any problems. However, I DO travel with earplugs, which I highly recommend no matter where you're staying. The hotel is designed so that the central elevator bank is super close to all rooms, so while I could hear a bit of noise from the elevators, it wasn't exactly a ruckus and didn't disturb me in the least. I did find it a bit amusing that I could (faintly) hear the alarm go off in the room next door on my last morning, but that might have been because my neighbor turned it up super super loud. I hadn't heard a peep out of him the entire time up till that point.I can't recommend the restaurants as I didn't eat in any of them or try the room service. Why bother? It's all overpriced anyway, and for half the bill you can just walk a few blocks and find someplace else to eat that'll be much more affordable and enable you to experience San Francisco a bit more. There are also Walgreens, Rite Aids and 7 Elevens everywhere for midnight munchies and bottled water (who wants to pay $3 for a snickers in the minibar?!). Save your cash for other fun things.All in all I had a very pleasant stay and recommend the Hyatt if location was important (shopaholics!) and a good deal could be found. Don't pay rack rate...it's a nice hotel but not THAT nice. :)",4-Jul-06,4
"If you are looking for a 3-star hotel in San Francisco, then this is the place for you. However, if you are looking for a 4-star hotel (as they seem to think they are) then the Hyatt is not for you.Small and thin towels, thin linens, small room, $43 per day for parking (yeah, its San Francisco), outdated bathroom, etc.The staff were all very friendly -- the one good point.We wont stay here again.",23-Jun-06,3
"I had gone to SF a month before this trip and noticed the great location of the Grand Hyatt. Only one block shy of Union Square and the Powell Street cable cars, I planned on booking with the Grand Hyatt for this weekend trip. The staff was very friendly (especially the doormen) and cheery. Although the room was a good size and the bathroom well-stocked, there were a few gliches.First of all, when we arrived, apparently the clean-up staff forgot to check the mini bar, as there were two Chinese food takeout containers in the drawers (obviously left over from the previous guest)...also there was a very distinct odor in the room which was a mix of the Chinese food and very strong body odor. I went to the front desk to complain and ask to get some air freshner and was assured it would be taken care of...I'd love to say is was, but most of the smell was masked by me opening the windows and spritzing my own perfume around when I returned hours later.The final glitch was the noise. We were placed on the 8th floor as the trip needed to be as economical as possible. Until about 1am, I was kept awake by the loud whistles used by the doormen in order to hail cabs. I'm sure had I been higher up this would not have been a problem, but it was a little annoying.Besides that, the Grand Hyatt was great. The beds were very comfortable and the soaps and shower products provided were lovely. However, nothing tops the excellent location of this hotel. It is central to all great parts of the city. Just keep in mind that knowing the areas surrounding are important as only a few blocks away is the Tenderloin district which most travelers should avoid. Enjoy your travels!",23-May-06,4
"This is a great location in Union Square, not too far from Chinatown, North Beach, etc. We did a lot of walking to restaurants (most within 15 min.) and neighborhoods. We walked to Fisherman's Wharf in about 40 minutes even.The hotel is nice and clean, nothing extremely special, but very nice. I would consider staying here again.Be sure to visit the 36th floor for the amazing view of the city and bay...it's beautiful!The exercise room is very upscale too.",15-May-06,4
"Great location, and friendly staff but that is where it ends everything about this place is average at best ! This hotel is not 4 star.",27-Apr-06,3
"We stayed at the GH the last week in March 2006. This was a very pricey hotel, but given the location and the city, I imagine that's just the way it is. We found no real problems with the room: good size, nice king bed, (but pillows too fat) great view of the city. Pros: great location! 1 block from the shopping and many restaurants. Friendly porters and very nice concierge. Nice fitness equipment. Cons: Don't stay in any room that ends with ""07"". We had 1107 which was at the very end of the hall...and I do mean the END. Walk down the hall, and walk smack dab into the our door...Doesn't sound so bad except that the room doors to the rooms on either side of us were right next to our door. If we had all been trying to get into our rooms, we would have had to draw numbers to see who got to go first! Needless to say, when people came in late and shut their doors, it was very loud. I see since we have returned home, that the website has changed. When we made our reservations, the website said there was a complimentary continental breakfast. Not so. There was a little place on the mezzanine that sold Starbucks coffee. So we went there on the first day. Paid 6.00 for 2 cups of coffee. Everyday after that, I went directly across the street to Starbucks and paid 6.51 for 2 cups of coffee and two breakfast rolls. The rest of the hotel was there too, I might add. There was no spa, no gift shop and the restaurant upstairs was extremely pricey as well, so we didn't eat there. There was a tee tiny coffee pot in the bathroom, but the coffee supplies were in the minibar..and there were no cups suitable for coffee anyway...just water glasses. Even the cheap hotels give travelers a continental breakfast and have complimentary coffee in the rooms. Also, I greatly appreciate the effort that many hotels are now making by asking travelers to use their towels more than one day. But for the price we paid for that room for 6 nights, I want my clean towels daily. Other GOOD things: Cable/Trolley cars only about a block away. Lots of shopping, even if it's just window shopping. Good restaurants.Lori's Diner: 1 block : 50's theme. We ate there twice. Great burgers and breakfast.Mel's Diner: not for sure on the location as our friend took us there the first night, But it had a ""Happy Day's"" type atmostphere and great burger/fries.Max's: 1 block: I had a huge BLT there...and BLT's are always good! They had a varied menu. You shouldn't have any trouble finding something tasty there.Ruth's Chris Steak House: Save your money if you want to eat there! Everything a la carte...but excellent! One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Yum!",19-Apr-06,2
"After much research we stayed at the Grand Hyatt for nine days, from April 6th. We picked this hotel based upon its location and because we had heard the Westin St. Francis (also in Union Square) was a bit run down.We booked a Regency club room.ROOM: We booked a room in the Regency club which are floors 32 and above. I requested a North facing room because these rooms have heavenly views of the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz and Coit tower. We had booked three rooms, and no one received a North-facing room. On the second night we all obtained North facing rooms, however these were all on lower levels (i.e. floor 27 and lower). This wasn't a problem for us, as we still had Regency club access and were still high enough to have a lovely view. The rooms were average at best. Nothing that special, except that the beds were fantastic. Small TV in bathroom was a nice perk.REGENCY CLUB: If you have the extra $$$, by all means upgrade to the Regency club. There is breakfast every morning (i.e. croissants, bagels, cereal, TONS of fresh fruit, cheese, ham, juice, coffee etc) and a cocktail hour from 4-7 pm which includes hot appetizers, dips, sodas (wine/spirits $4.00/each). But the real reason to join the regency club is: the view fantastic overlooking Coit Tower, the Bay. Who wouldn't want to wake up to this every morning?! The Regency club is on the 32nd floor.LOCATION: You cannot beat the location of this hotel. This is reason enough to stay here.GYM: Not bad, but small. Three treadmills makes for a bit of a squeeze in the a.m. for a run.GRANDVIEWS RESTAURANT: Located on the the top floor (36) this restaurant had good food and great service. The views were excellent, similar to Regency club views except they also have views facing the West. Open for breakfast too.Skip the rest as it does not pertain to the Hotel per se:RESTAURANTS:Gary Danko: Booked two months in advance to get a table for four. Service was great but food wasn't as spectacular as one would expect. Postrio: Wolfgang Puck's restuarant. Fantastic food. Try to get there if you can.Alioto's: On Fisherman's wharf. Request a table with a view of the bay. Seafood is excellent despite that the place looks like a bit of a tourist trap.The Slanted Door: Please, if you love Vietnamese foods, please go here! The Imperial Rolls were amazing. Located in the Ferry Building. Nice views of the Bay Bridge. Very crowded, very noisy. Horizon's: (Saulsalito) lovely views of the Bay, great food. Please email me with questions.",16-Apr-06,4
"I stayed overnight with my young son. I asked for a room with a view and got one on the 25th floor. We had a very nice view of the financial district and parts of the bay. The room was not huge, but fine for our purposes. The bathroom was good, but not posh. Everything was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. It was a little stuffy, however. The location could not be better. It's 1 block from Union Square with all of its shopping and area restaurants. The Powell St. cable car is just one block away as are the gates to Chinatown. If you bring a car, you can park overnight in the Stockton/Sutter parking garage which is just across the street. The overnight rate there is $21, as opposed to the hotel valet for $41. When I made the reservation via phone, I asked if they would match the Orbitz rate, which they did. I would recommend this hotel to others.",19-Mar-06,4
"We stayed at this hotel for a week in late February. We chose the Regency club, which meant we were on a higher floor and breakfast was included. Great hotel and staff. Rooms are very comfortable, view wonderful! Would definitely stay there again.",7-Mar-06,5
"I enjoyed this very comfortable hotel. Stayed 3 nights in January 2006. Wonderful bed, wonderful view, friendly and professional staff. You can't beat the location and at any price it's a deal. I travel a lot and this was a perfect experience. Hope to stay again in April.",15-Feb-06,5
"My wife and I booked a night for a Holiday getaway. We have no complaints about the room. Our room was clean, comfortable, and afforded us a fantastic view of the bay. Parking cost is steep, but standard for the area - $40. I felt the website could've offered better directions to the hotel. The Union Square is difficult to navigate with all the one-way roads - even for those of us who have been to SF several times. The valet service was excellent. I would consider staying again but not during the holiday season.",25-Jan-06,4
"The upsides of the hotel are its location (but then again there are many others in the area) and the helpful concierge.Now, the downsides...The building CREAKS! We were there from Dec 26-29, 2005 and needless to say, we left the hotel, sleep-deprived. The hotel actually has cards to inform guests of the creaking noise due to high-wind periods at the front desk but it's a little too late once you've checked in! Perhaps, they should post it on their web-site.When we complained, we were told that the building makes noises because it moves when there are high winds. And the building moves because of the erathquake-proof foundation? Eh? We work and live in earthquake and typhoon-prone Tokyo in high rise buildings and no, our buildings do not creak in windy weather.The rooms we stayed in were tired looking and shabby, the sheet had a hole in it and the towels in the bathroom were old.The housekeeping service is inefficient as there were always used cups and plates lying around the hallway. Yikes!We are used to the ""grand"" Hyatt quality here in Tokyo and were very disappointed by the lack of quality in San Francisco. This particular hotel needs to be stripped off its 4 star rating.We would certainly return to San Francisco but most definitely not to the Grand Hyatt.",1-Jan-06,1
"Well I should start by saying that the room was nice, the bathroom spacious and the location superb. It's right in the middle of some great shopping! Overall we enjoyed our stay with a few little hiccups along the way.The minor issues: 1. The hair dryer in the room was fried and we called the front desk to get a replacement. It never came. We had to call a second time before we got a replacement. The good thing is that at least on the second call we got a response within 15 minutes.2. We cancelled a wake-up call but they called anyway - twice. My husband was there on a conference and I chose to sleep late one morning but the wake-up call he cancelled came anyway and woke me up at 4:30am.The major issue:My husband was in the room taking a break from his conference and I was in the shower. We had the privacy sign out on the door and the privacy lock engaged. The mini-bar attendant (a man) took the sign off the door and wedged it on the wall behind our room number. He knocked briefly and then tried to come right on in. The lock prevented the door from opening more than 4 inches. Initially I was upset because if the privacy sign is out it generally means you don't want to be disturbed. The second reason I was upset was that if my husband wasn't in the room at the time and I had forgotten to engage the privacy lock, ... fill in the blanks. Since the shower is right next to the hotel door you can clearly hear it outside in the hall. My only assumption is that either the employee was trying to walk in on something or he simply disregards people's privacy.In my opinion I think this is a serious security concern. When we discussed it with a member of management, she seemed concerned and said she'd speak to the staff and security about the incident.What's interesting is that between the first phone call to the manager and the time I left the room an hour later, it happened a second time. I happened to be at the door about to go out and saw him through the peep hole. He removed the privacy sign from the door and wedged it on the wall again and then knocked. At least this time he didn't try to enter our room.Just be aware of this when thinking of booking your room there. The main lesson to learn is to always put the privacy sign out and to engage the privacy lock when you don't want anyone barging in. This could have happened at any hotel room in the world so take this lesson with you anywhere you choose to stay.Now for the fun stuff:Grand Views lounge on the 36th floor is worth the view but you'll get sticker shock when ordering any drinks. A plain martini is $12 and it had too much vermouth in it. I couldn't finish it because it was horrible but you won't go wrong with wine or beer. This is a great place to go for a quick cup of coffee to enjoy the view but there are better places to get a drink.Perry's Downtown:This place makes a great burger and is a good place to go for drinks or a good burger and a beer. It's about 2 1/2 blocks away from the Hyatt. It's a good lunch place and a good casual dinner place and is reasonable on the wallet.Steps of Rome Trattoria:North BeachThis is the best Italian food!! I had the Gnocchi alla Serentia and it was fantastic! The place doesn't look like much but the people are friendly and the food is wonderful!Pizza Chicago:Ghiradelli SquareGreat pizza joint in a casual atmosphere. Reasonable and worth every penny!La Suite:On Brannan near the Bay BridgeAmazing french food!!! It's in a higher price range but the food is awesome! The bar is trendy, the drinks very generous and the staff is friendly.Hawthorn Lane:I'm not sure where it's located but the food and atmosphere were amazing. This is among the highest priced restaurants in the city but if you love good food and excellent service this is the place for you. I had the lobster - mmm mmm!Alcatraz evening tour:Ok, so I'm not into cheezy tourist stuff but I enjoyed this tour. If for nothing else, go for the views of the city. It's a neat piece of history to check out and has incredible views of the city, the Golden Gate, Angel Island and the Bay Bridge. Bring the tripod though, and turn off the flash if you're using a small tourist digital camera for a great shot.Getting around:We only used taxi services to get to and from SFO and to go out to nicer restaurants. The rest of the time we relied on Muni buses and Cable Cars. Make sure you get a good map of the routes and stops first and you'll be prepared to get anywhere. You'll find more tourists on the cable cars and locals on the buses. You'll also find that peak times (especially weekends) will mean full cable cars and longer waits to get on.Presidio and the Golden Gate:You can either drive or take the bus to the Presidio up to the Golden Gate. There are several photo spots to get some great photos so explore further than just the initial upper level and you'll find some really pretty areas.Palace of Fine Arts:The rotunda is really pretty as was the area surrounding it. The marina district was cool but we didn't explore that much. Next trip maybe.",14-Dec-05,2
"Booked this hotel for a mini-getaway for the family on Thanksgiving weekend in San Francisco. It was absolutely beautiful. Of course the city of SF is beautful. But I tell you, when we walked into our standard room we were delighted to see that it was far from standard! It was modern with updated furnishings, a beautiful interior, and boy was our view grand! We had a perfect view of the Christmas Tree in the center of Union Square (the tree lighting ceremony was viewed from our room), plus we could see Macy's, The Cheesecake Factory, and Neiman Marcus. It was amazing. When I woke up in the morning, I just walked across the street and beat the crowds to the all-popular After Thanksgiving Day Sales at Macy's and Loehmans down the street. It's a shoppers heaven, an artists dream, and a luxury spot all in one. The kids and husband loved it too! We got a good deal on the hotel, but be prepared for expensive valet parking.",27-Nov-05,5
"I spent a week here in September and was extremely pleased.The incomparable Union Square location--walking distance to almost everything, gives the impression the city was laid out around the hotel instead of the other way around. The comfy, king-sized bed,coffeemaker, plentiful bathroom amenities and decent views-- although only staying on the 11th floor-- were a nice added touch.The restaurant and shopping recommendations from the concierge staff were dead on accurate(they mentioned several top-notch but sensibly priced Asian restaurants) and much appreciated. Highly recommended as long as you don't have a car(the parking was about $45 a day!)",7-Nov-05,5
"Just spent one night at the Grand Hyatt and was very happy with the experience! Haven't stayed here for a number of years and the hotel has been renovated since then.My room on the 26th floor had an incredible east facing view (skyline in the middle, water views to the right and the left), the bed was comfortable with nice pillows and linens, room was clean and plenty large. Nice bath products, but so so towels. Great shower, lots of water pressure and very clean. Love the little tiny TV in the bathroom :)Also, the iron worked really well (sounds stupid but it is amazing how often they don't work properly) and I always enjoy the option of the complimentary coffee in the room.Staff were very pleasant and easy to deal with.Don't miss the lounge on the 36th floor, great place to have cocktails and look at the views.I will definitely stay here on my next trip (which will be very soon).",11-Oct-05,4
"Stayed here for two nights in mid September. Hotel is well located to all the shops and Chinatown. Cab fare to Fisherman's wharf is about $10 otherwise jump on one of the very crowded cable cars. Rooms are small but this city is so great, so dont waste your time sitting inside for too long.Would definitely stay here again.",25-Sep-05,4
"A friend and I were in town overnight to see a play. We got a great room deal online, and the room was spacious and clean with 22nd floor views of Coit Tower. Comfortable beds and pillows. TV in the bathroom was a fun touch, however it did not get all the cable channels that the big TV did. We ate dinner at the top floor Grandviews restaurant, which was delicious. We received coupons for a free meal (at Grandviews) and for 11% off at Macy's Dept Store. The location can't be beat, walking distance to Union Square and Market Street shops, Chinatown, and Financial District. Long wait for car, though, about 20 minutes, so plan ahead if you need to leave at a specific time.",24-Sep-05,4
"Fairly typical Hyatt, located near Union Square with all of its great shopping, access to cable cars, Chinatown, etc. Small rooms at the Hyatt, but very efficient front lobby staff (valet parking and bell boys are slow and surly--they like the business types best and it shows).",26-Aug-05,4
"A very nice and centrally located hotel. Very good service. Rooms are averaged sized Hyatt and nicely decorated, but all dark woods. Rooms facing directly north have a fantastic view of the bay, Alcatraz, Coit Tower and Fisherman's Wharf. The Regency Club is excellent with an outstanding view. Meals in the Grandviews Restaurant are also outstanding and not outrageously priced. One poster mentioned street noise. The sliding glass windows in some rooms need repairing. We have stayed at this hotel at least 20 times and on several occasions we have landed up with a room where the window does not keep out the noise. Check as soon as you are in the room and ask for a different room if there is significant noise.",22-Aug-05,4
"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for four nights. We arrived right at check-in time, but there was no line so we were into our room quickly. The room was visually nearly as expected overall, but there were some issues. The major problem was the level of comfort for the king bed. It ran a close second in terms of discomfort only to our stay in London two years ago where the bed was beyond uncomfortable. We figured we would attempt a night and see how it went, but we were up many times throughout the night due to the discomfort. We had a tour early the next morning, but upon arriving asked for another room due to the bed. One of the desk staff asked which floor we were on and when we told her the 9th, she said that the beds on (at least) that floor had not been updated, but other floors had been. They had no rooms available for that night, but agreed to move us for the remaining two nights. Once in the new room, the bed wasnâ€™t nearly as good as the ones when we have stayed at Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach or Hyatt Regency Scottsdale, but was better than what we started in at this hotel. The hotel rooms do seem in need of some minor remodeling as it is showing its age. For example, the bath tub in both room had some mildew. Also, regarding cleanliness, the first room did not have washcloths and had hair on the bathroom floor.The location of the hotel was as good as expected given our level of prior research. The nearest cable stop is very near and all the tours pick-up at this hotel. We did order room service and although very expensive by most standards, it was very tasty. Just a word of caution â€“ I would not generally recommend walking around at night in the area due to the number of panhandlers. Overall, I would recommend the hotel due to the value and location.",14-Aug-05,3
"This was my 1st time to stay in San Francisco and it was truely a pleasure.Got to the Hyatt on Friday night,easy, speedy and friendly check-in. Got up to our room on the 24th fl. and yes,the room is kinda' small but comfortable,clean and what a view! The thing is,in this town,there is so much to do and see...get out of your room and enjoy it all!! We did order room service twicw and it was a bit expensive but the folks we dealt with were very pleasant,orderly and professional...oh yeah,the food was great!The hotel is in a great location,restaurants,shopping,bars,dancing,buss and trolly lines,close to Chinatown,stores and shopping of all kinds,Union Square always has locals who are setting up small kiosks and selling their wears. How sweet is it that if you walk,you can go through neighboorhoods and enjoy each of their cultures and FOOD!! We stayed 3 days and were on the go all time,some places we went back to enjoy twice. Just enjoy all there is,it's a great town,folks were very friendly. We will go back to this hotel and this town.",9-Aug-05,5
"We would recommend this hotel notwithstanding a few glitches in our stay. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt 3 nights in early July. Knowing this is high tourist season in SF, we were surprised we were able to book our reservation the night before our arrival. The location can't be beat; you are within walking distance of Chinatown, MOMA and some of the best shopping in the area. We were somewhat inconvenienced by loud road repair on the street adjacent to the hotel, but the hotel had no control over this and the noise was barely discernible in our upper floor room.Would recommend upgrading to an upper floor room with a view of Coit Tower. The view of SF was breathtaking from that vantage point. The room was also slightly larger than those on the lower floors.We had a few problems with the service at the hotel including the extra pillows and blanket that never arrived despite repeated requests and a misunderstanding over the restaurant coupons we received with our upgrade (coupons were applied differently that stated). Nonetheless, after talking with management, the problem was quickly taken care of. Would definately return again to this hotel.",8-Aug-05,4
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco July 8-10. I got a room on Priceline a few days before I left for a fantastic price of $80 per night!!!! For a four star hotel you can't beat that price. It was steps from Union Square, a five minute walk from the Powell Bart station. I took the Bart from the San Fran Airport--about a 30 minute ride and only $4.95. The hotel is close to Chinatown, North Beach, Japantown, public transportation. On Union Square there is a half price ticket booth for the theater. Les Miz was playing only a block from the hotel. You MUST go to the Ferry Building on Satuday morning if you can. They have a great Farmer's Market from 8-2 (get there as close to 8am as possible since it gets rather crowded). A number of stalls serve hot breakfast behind the Ferry Building and there is live music. What a great way to spend the morning...you are right on the water, great people watching too. People buy organic produce, breads, meats, fruits from their favorite farms. They bring their shopping carts, baskets and tote bags. I bought a pint of strawberries and a pastry and sat on a bench to watch the scene. The weather was perfect. Inside the Ferry Building there are some excellent places to eat too---Mijita, Delica, Ciao Bella. The food all over San Fran is fantastic. Besides Chinatown I went to Japantown--you really feel like you're in Japan. There are many places to eat, shopping malls where everyone speaks Japanese. That is the place to go for sushi and other dishes....So the hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. I had a king size bed. Toiletries were provided. My only complaints were that the water pressure in my shower was a little weak and the bed a tad bit too hard. Other than that, the service was great. I would definitely stay there again.",12-Jul-05,5
"My husband and I booked our packaged airfare and five night stay at the Grand Hyatt through Travelocity. After much research online, we chose this four star hotel for location and outstanding value. We were very pleased overall. We had a beautiful room with a view, excellent service, and great location to Union Square, China Town and to the cable cars. The hotel staff was warm and friendly. The concierge, Annie, was very helpful in making arrangements for various trips to the wine country, Monterey/Carmel, and other places of interest. We were extremely happy with all of the tour groups that she suggested. The only area of dissappointment was in the hotel food. The bar and restaurant have wonderful views of the city, but our food in the dining room was not enjoyable. The tough, gristly steak and the ""shrimp"" (tiny, bay shrimp) and bay scallop (tiny and gritty) pasta were some of the worst food we have ever had. We realized that most hotels aren't known for wonderful food, but we were hoping for much better. All in all, I would definitely recommend the Hyatt Grand.",12-Jul-05,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco after leaving an unacceptable ""landmark"" Union Square hotel one night into our trip. The Grand Hyatt desk staff was incredibly accomodating to find a room for the balance of our vacation. We stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the city and the bay. The bellman told us the room was very recently updated. The linens and pillow-top mattress were very nice! Everything was very clean and the view was just incredible. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful: doorman, front desk, bell services and concierge. The location of this hotel is very convenient to Union Square, China Town, shopping and theaters. As with any of the hotels in this area, you should request an upper level room, at a slight cost premium, if you want a better view and less street noise.",24-Jun-05,5
"Altough this hotel extrudes a business/formal impression it is extremely luxurious and well managed for a 4* hotel. My partner and I stayed in one of the club level rooms, the rooms themselves were well equipt, clean and very comfy! The bathroom was quite small but served it's purpose non the less. With the addition to the club level room, all day drinks and light meals were served which were a pleasure. Some of the views from the hotel are wonderful but make sure you ask for a 'good view'!I would defineately recommend this hotel as it is well within everyone's budget.",21-Jun-05,4
"As a Hyatt Gold Passport Diamond member and having stayed at many Hyatts around the world I was surprised to see this hotel classified as a Grand Hyatt. The room is worse than many Hyatt Regencys elsewhere in the world. Example, the blanket is a thin polyester military style blanket. In this day and age when almost every nice hotel has upgraded to duvets and down comforters (even some Four Points by Sheraton!), I find this truly disappointing.The room is small, not well cleaned, and in need of an update. Bathroom is small with no separate shower and a very small tubThe service is also quite lacking to be qualified as a Grand Hyatt. It took housekeeping 30 mintes to bring me a laundry bag.The best part about this hotel is its location, right by Union square, close to shopping and BART. Of course this means with the poorly insulated windows I could hear every car and police sirens even on the 33rd floor.Try the Park Hyatt if you don't have to walk to Union Square shops. It is a much better hotel.",4-Jun-05,2
"We booked the Grand Hyatt for our first trip to San Francisco because of the closeness to Union Square and the Regency service. The hotel service was the best I have had and the views from the Regency level and restaurant were out of this world. The staff at the hotel were helpful and courteous. The Regency service was strictly a continental breakfast; however, there was plenty and the coffee was great. I would highly recommend the hotel. It is close to the cable car hub and easy to catch a taxi to the location of choice. The hotel was very clean and the linen quality was wonderful. The views from our 33rd floor room were magnificient and we could see Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatrez, Coit Tower and China Town. You won't go wrong here. There is a very safe atmosphere.",18-May-05,5
"Stayed here about five years ago, and recently returned. Things at this property just haven't changed, like it is in a early 90's time warp. Decor is dated and threadbare, but you can't beat the location and the potential of getting a very reasonable rate on the online bidding sites. Front desk was pleasant, but didn't offer upgrade possibility. Given fifth floor room overlooking garage. Room was clean, bed was firm, linens/towels were standard, certainly not luxurious. Bathroom contains odd little TV. Location on Union Square is super-convenient. Didn't try hotel food, with many great dining options in walking distance.",17-May-05,3
"The location was fantastic. Right in Union Square. So lots of great shopping and within a block from the starting point of the famous trolley. The lobby was clean and classy and the valet and check-in staff were professional and efficient. Breakfast was included in our deal and the service was good. We had the buffet breakfast which was a decent spread - hot and delicious.All that said, here comes the negative part. The rooms were disgusting. We had a non smoking room at the end of the hall, next to the chambermaid's supply room. Luckily we couldn't hear anything. But the dreadful part of this hotel was the condition of the room. The bathroom was small and the tub was shallow and old. It was quite dark while I showered because there wasn't a separate light above the tub. The carpet was old and not in the cleanest condition. My son dropped a toy behind the bedside table and I had to reach in to get it. There were compacts and lipsticks and some other stuff back there. It looked like someone hadn't vacuumed or dusted the room in decades. Filthy!The bed was too soft and I woke with a backache. The pillows were lumpy and icky. The sheets were clean but the bedspread and blankets was disgustingly dirty and old. And to think that the bedspread was in direct contact with the pillows.The price was great for a 5 star hotel and location. The only thing that will hold me back from staying again is the condition of the room.",1-May-05,3
This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel...please. I couldn't tell if i was sleeping on the floor or if it was my bed. The pillows were like a sack of potatoes. No offense but the room smelled like my grandma's house. Stinky! We stayed at the Omni Hotel for $60 less a night and it was a completely awesome stay. You would think that the GRAND Hyatt would be able to compete with a lesser star hotel. Not even close. The check in staff i will say was very pleasant and accomadated us with a early check in which was nice. Overall i would have to say two thumbs down for our stay at this hotel. View from the 36th floor is what keeps this place on the charts.,19-Apr-05,2
"Reading through some of these reviews proves that you really can't please everyone, especially Hotwire users! We got a rate of $77 per night for this hotel through Hotwire (on which it was categorized as a 4-star hotel located in Union Square East), and it was a complete steal at this price, which was less than half of the rack rate. We had a very clean, comfortable, and spacious room with a king-sized bed, and a great view of Union Square. For those complaining about valet parking rates, I'm not sure what else they expected bringing a car to downtown San Francisco, where parking is naturally at a premium. If your trip will be confined to touring within the city, no car is necessary from this location as it is ideally located near all forms of public transportation. (If you want to spend any time in wine country, just rent a car for the day(s) you will be there, which is what we did.) Also, very few hotels have free high-speed internet; the $10 per 24-hours charge at the Grand Hyatt is certainly not higher than the going rate. People who are surprised by that must not travel much. Bottom line: I would have been satisfied with this hotel even at the rack rate, but at the Hotwire deal, it was fantastic. It's a terrific base for sightseeing and shopping.",4-Apr-05,5
"I just returned from San Francisco on Friday April 1,2005. My stay at the Grand Hyatt was fantastic. It is located in the best spot,walking distance to the shopping district,places to eat. We Could not have picked a better place to stay. The rooms are great,nice and clean view was fantastic,I was on the 20th floor corner room. The hotel staff was very polite always anxious to serve us. I loved San Francisco,I am planning to go back,and will definitely be staying at the Grand Hyatt. I am going to tell my friends who plan a trip to the city to stay at the Grand Hyatt.",3-Apr-05,5
"Great hotel! Stayed there this month and had a very good experience. This hotel had a friendly and helpful staff, good concierges, great views from the restaurant at the top and an excellent location near Union Square, just a block or three from the cable cars, BART and Muni trains and the streetcars on Market.",29-Mar-05,5
"The parking is a bit expensive at $41 for valet parking, but I guess that's what you get when you travel to a big city. The hotel is in a great location with plenty of transportation options, so a car is not really necessary and I would not rent one on my next visit to San Francisco. Grandviews Lounge is a great place to have your first cocktail of the night offering great views of the entire city. This hotels concierge staff has got to be the best in the city, they arranged a wonderful day trip for us to the Wine Country that we absolutely loved.",9-Mar-05,5
"The location of this hotel is everything. Virtually on Union Square in the middle of some of the finest high-end shopping in the world, and within easy walking distance to Chinatown, it is in a terrific spot. The people working there were nice enough, and the place reasonably clean. The shower curtain in my bathroom was a bit mildewy, but I expect that they would have changed it immediately if I had called housekeeping. I don't know about how the price compares to other similar hotels in the neighborhood, but it is probably in line. I was there for a couple nights for a conference, and the beds were comfortable and the room was not too noisy on the 9th floor. Someone on the 5th floor said that he heard the traffic at night. I wouldn't mind staying there again myself if someone else were paying for it, but the smaller, more intimate, hotels within a few blocks are much less expensive for very nice accommodations. ",13-Feb-05,3
"With a nationally recognized name like Hyatt, I guess we expected more. We found it to be a very average place to stay. There was no sense of warmth - more like an impersonal lodging with hidden gimmicks to increase revenue. Hyatt charges $39.50 for customer parking over night, but other hotels checked and city/private garages are about $31. Each room has a small referigerator and snack tray with a warning: pick one up and it automatically registers on your bill. And a warning not to use the refrigerator for personal items, but to call housekeeping for that need. The room was nice, clean and no complaints as to comfort. The hotel is very conveniently located for shoppers, downtown walkers and gawkers, and the theater district. Much is in walking distance. It's not a 'bad' hotel, just not one that entices you back for another stay. For a revisit to SF we will try one of the smaller, lesser known hotels, yet hotels that also receive local high ratings for accomodations. ",11-Feb-05,3
"We paid $75 for the room through Priceline for a one-night stay 1/14/05. Upon checking in, my request for a room on a high floor was met with an offer to give me a room on the 29th floor for an extra $20, which would then include 2 continental breakfasts (worth $20) at the Grandviews Restaurant on the top floor or the Mezzanine Cafe (no room service allowed). I gave in b/c we were staying there for the views but was a little upset they didn't have anything for my original room rate. The check in person told me that all floors above the 25th have unobstructed views.Our room overlooked the Coit tower and we could see a little bit of the ocean-breathtaking! Room itself was worn with mirrors in odd places, nice-sized closet and tiny bathroom. TV in bathroom and basic toiletries. You can connect to internet via modem for a charge, but my friend's laptop seemed to detect the wireless for free. Even though our room was next to the vending/ice machine, it was quiet and we got a good night's sleep.We had breakfast upstairs at the Grandviews Restaurant and found out that their continental breakfast is horrible- coffee, orange juice, and choice of 1 bread (bagel, toast, English muffin, danish)- that's it!!! We should've taken up our waiter's offer of using each breakfast certificate toward their buffet ($21) or other made-to-order dishes on the menu ($11 and up). He would've deducted $20 from our order if we didn't go with the continental. Views from the restaurant are amazing.In the end, the location can't be beat: we parked at the Sutter-Stockton garage across the street and paid $14 for parking between 6:30PM and 10:30AM. The staff was very nice and accomodating, and I would recommend the $20 upgrade if you plan to eat breakfast at the hotel- the cost of the food offsets the upgrade fee. In the future, I would ask if they have recently upgraded any rooms and request those, since I stayed at a renovated Hyatt in Denver and the room was of a much higher quality. The hotel's restaurants don't seem notable except for breakfast, and there isn't much else to do there, but hey, that's what Union Square is for.",15-Jan-05,3
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Dec 26th for one night. The rooms were nice and clean. Average bathroom. The view from the lounge on the 36th floor was fantastic. We were offered a suite upgrade for $75, but we declined. We paid $99 on the Hyatt website. Biggest issue was the very hard mattresses and parking charges. There is a Starbucks across the street. I was suprised that there were no restaurants near the hotel. Location was close to Union Square.",28-Dec-04,3
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for five days from December 15 to the 20th, 2004, when the Union Square area was done up beautifully for Christmas, and the holiday rush was at its peak. I was pleasantly surprised with both the rooms and service during our stay. The first night was a problem as a problem with a noisy elevator kept us awake, but the following morning the hotel staff quickly moved us to another room and the new room, with a view of Union Square on the 25th floor, was quiet and comfortable. A good sized bath, dressing area and comfortable beds made the hotel a very pleasant respite from the days sightseeing and shopping. Breakfast on the 36th floor restaurant, with terrific views of the city and good food started the day on a pleasant note. The only bad thing I could note would be the $40 a day charge for parking and the $10 daily charge for internet service. That said, it was extremely convenient to have the car quickly brought around anytime I wanted, and the internet service worked well. As I got an excellent room price on the web, the overall cost for the five day stay was reasonable. I would definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again.",25-Dec-04,4
"My wife and I had to stay in the city over Thanksgiving weekend, and Priceline got us an $80/night rate at the Grand Hyatt -- about half the rate at other travel websites. I was a little concerned, given the mediocre reviews over the last few months (cleanliness issues, etc.), but fortunately the hotel workers' strike ended earlier in the week.Although ""4-star hotel"" may lead some to expect a more luxurious room, ours on the 7th floor was spotless, and we enjoyed our stay.Pros: Excellent meals (although not inexpensive, with required 19% gratuity plus $3 delivery charge) -- perhaps the best room service we've ever had: the seafood Louie, smoked chicken primavera, berries with creme fraiche, and NY cheesecake were all wonderful. Location (a block away from Union Square and close to many nice restaurants and coffee shops). Rather large room (for SF, anyway) with the king-size bed. Relatively quiet. Small second cable TV/radio in the bathroom (!). Better cable TV service than most hotels (including CourtTV, Discovery History Channel, HBO, Starz). Nice quality toiletries.Cons: Bed was very hard, although it didn't aggravate my bad back. Parking is close by, but either very expensive (valet) or difficult to enter (Stockton & Sutter garage must be entered from westbound Bush, but one-way streets and the no-turn intersections requires lining up the entry from 4 blocks away). Parking/traffic issues made worse by our arrival date (the day after Thanksgiving).In the future, we'll probably stay closer to Fort Mason, where my wife had to work over the weekend, but if you're looking for a big hotel near Union Square, a Priceline search of 4-star Union Square hotels may get you a room here.",29-Nov-04,4
"I stayed at the GH for 2 nights in September. Got the room through priceline for $75.00 per night. The staff was friendly and did their best to accomodate us in a quiet area of the hotel. We were on the 23 floor and did not find it noisy. You can hear the elevators somewhat but it didn't keep me awake and I am a light sleeper. The room was very clean, although, I didn't look under the bed. The bathroom was clean no mold or mildew. Linen and floors were clean. We had a nice view. The coffee was complimentary, and they even brought us more when we called them. Parking is pricey, but parking across the street is less costly, if you don't plan on driving in the city. I enjoyed the stay and will stay there again...",23-Nov-04,4
"We stayed at the Hyatt on November 13 2004. The check-in was quick and the staff friendly. We had a room on the 23rd floor. Nice view and it was great to be able to open the slider and get some fresh air. Of course with the door open we could hear the loud protests of the locked-out union workers. We parked at the garage across the street and didn't go in and out so ""only"" paid $24.00. We found an almond on the floor and my son found a bottle of juice under one bed and a small pile of crumbs under the corner of the other bed. The paint on the bathroom door was peeling and there was mildew in the shower. I was amazed that such a nice hotel would provide a coffee maker but charge for the actual coffee! The location was great and we had a discount but I will shop around for my next trip to San Francisco.",14-Nov-04,2
"Spent three nights at the GH during Labor Day Weekend. The location was perfect for shopping, but the rooms were very disappointing. The room my husband and I stayed in was dusty and dirty. There was hair on the bathroom floor, the toilet seat was sticky, and there were nasty stains on the mattress dust ruffles of our room and our kids' room. A member of housekeeping vacuumed the outside hallway every morning at 8:00 a.m., which I felt was more to awaken us rather than to vacuum up dirt. I admit I am very clean and notice every detail, but I consider this unacceptable for a 4-star hotel.",8-Sep-04,2
stayed here in mid august for 4 nights paid approx $150 plus tax for a 2 bed room(not worth it ).check in very good was up graded to a room with a view on the 30th floor and a free continental breakfast for $20.00 per night.view was excellent.right overlooking union sq.very windy and noisey at night as it was a we could hear police sirens all nightroom was tiredlocation of hotel was excellent but do not bring a car as its a fortune to park.the hotel was not up to the standard of 4 star it boasts and not worth the money we paid,24-Aug-04,3
"Stayed here for about a week in August. Booked through Priceline, so the front desk didn't give us a very high floor, and put us in a ADA room (besides the grab bars in the tub, it wasn't so bad). We had a decent view of Union Square and a sliding door leading out to a hazardous balcony. Room was fine but could have used a little more warmth and furniture (the ADA rooms are a bit bigger and emptier). There is a lounge and restaurant on the top floor with great 360 views of the city. The hotel is very conveniently located, with good bus service and close to the Powell St. BART and MUNI stop. But the surrounding neighborhood isn't much fun at night and food is limited, although Chinatown is a 10 minute walk.",24-Aug-04,4
"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt a few weeks ago, on the last leg of our 10 day vacation. I thought I had found a great bargain in an expensive city (I had a discount for $100 off a 2 night stay) and was prepared to give this hotel 4 stars. After reading other users' reviews, I've changed my opinion--I think I'm going to have to start using Priceline! Hearing that people stayed here for $75 a night makes me feel like I got ripped off since we paid just under $200 a night (without the discount). We figured for that price, the location, and the Hyatt name, it would be worth the price. Thinking back, the hotel was really nothing special. It was ok as far as decor, and the room wasn't THAT small. We were only on the 5th floor, so we had no view. Also, you could hear people talking in the hall and in adjacent rooms, which was annoying. I don't think the hotel has a pool (not that we found, anyway) which would be an amenity you would expect to find at most of the larger hotels. The parking fee was outrageous! The staff was friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions of where to eat. I really wish that we had stayed closer to Fisherman's Wharf, because that's where we ended up spending most of our time anyway. All in all, we had a pleasant stay, but now that I look back on it, I don't think we got our money's worth.",24-Aug-04,3
"If you're coming to San Francisco to have fun shopping, you'll love Union Square. The hotel is right across the street from Starbucks and if you don't like the restaurant in the hotel (its pricey), there are plenty of places to eat nearby. There's a cafe about one block away that has a nice breakfast menu.The room was nice, unfortunately, to use the coffee pot in the room, there's a $2.50 fee! However, I did use the refrigerator in the room to keep water I bought at a nearby drugstore.The staff is helpful and friendly.",23-Aug-04,4
"Grand Hyatt proved to be a generally good experience for us. Stayed 08.18.04 through 08.21.04. Phenominal location, within minutes of several bus ruotes, the BART station, and Union Square. Generally quiet at night. Great views from our floor. Hotel staff, from valets to front desk, were helpful and polite. Especialy impressed with the concierges', who steered us to some great restaurants around downtown. Room was clean and comfortable but small for a four star hotel, and the decor was woefully dated (brown/blue carpet, pink walls, etc.) Bathroom was average in size and lacked amenities. Our sink gurgled up some grainy sand like substance one night. Called the front desk about it and engineering fixed it promptly.The hotel does have several deawbacks, however. First is the valet parking fees. $43.00 per night! having lived in San Francisco I know parking is at a premium but WOW! Our total bill for parking ($300 for the week) was roughly half what it cost to stay the six nights. Outrageous! Problem is there aren't many options nearby. There are two garages within a block of the hotel but their rates vary and you have limited in and out privilages. If it's at all possible, don't bring your car to this hotel. Take advantage of the excellent public transportation. Careful if you book here. Do not pay rack rate or anything near it. This is a very expensive hotel for what you get. Through Priceline we got a $75.00 a night rate and felt with the valet parking fees it was just barely worth the cost. They'll quote $209.00 to above $300.00 per night (plus parking) and this hotel is just not worth it. A few other things, your room will probably ""squeak"", especially in the afternoons. When you check in you are given a small piece of paper with your room keys informing you that because of wind the building sways, resulting in squeaking walls. Believe it! It's particularly annoying in the afternoon. It sounds like you're on an old ship. Avoid Grandviews. The view is extraordinary but the food is blah (and very expensive for what you get) and the service is terrible. They have a nice bar next to the restaurant but the service is just as bad there. We waited 25 minutes for two black and tans and a dirty martini. Business center is sub-par. Staff was very nice and very accomodating but it has a total of one fax machine, one copier and two computers. You get ten minutes free but after that it's $30.00 per hour to use their facilities. Not worth it. There is a Kinko's a few blocks away. One last thing. Several hotels in the downtown area are subject to very loud protests on weekend nights. There is an ongoing labor dispute between the hotels and their service staff, resulting in orderly but noisy demostrations in the afternoons. The police and hotel staff handle themsleves and the situation well, but beware of protestors shoving fliers in your face as you come and go in the evenings. From the 14th floor they are very audible but usually they clear out after dark. Overall a clean, convienent, safe but noisy and expensive stay. If you don't need much from a hotel and you can get a good rate it will serve your needs (mostly on the backs of the very nice staff). If you're looking for a true, four star experience, keep looking.",21-Aug-04,3
"My wife and I stayed here for two nights during a week-long trip up the CA coast. Got it for $100 per night through Priceline, which said it was four stars. Sorry, I've been in four-star hotels, and this isn't one of them. We heard parking is $45 (with tax) and decided to leave our car at friends in Berkeley and take the train in and out of the city. You might want to find a residential neighborhood in the city and leave your car there, and take a taxi to the hotel. The front desk was able to give us a room high in the hotel (it was a handicap-accessible room), so we had awesome views facing Union Square below and the bay in the distance. The location is great although, as someone else pointed out, it's a little challenging to find (it's not quite on Union Square). One incredibly annoying thing was that when our complimentary newspaper was delivered outside our hotel room each morning between 5 and 6 a.m., the person threw it down with a ""WHAP!"", instead of placing it quietly on the ground -- thoroughly startling us and awakening us for the morning. Not good. Also, we could hear people from up and down the hallway, opening and closing doors, engaging in conversation -- don't expect peace and quiet. Overall, the hotel does the trick, if you get it for a good price. But don't expect it to capture the character of San Francisco. It's just a regular old Hyatt. Also, if you want a truly first-class San Francisco experience, consider using Hotwire to find a four-star hotel on Nob Hill. There are four hotels there, each one world-class, so even though you can't pick the hotel, you'll be assured of receiving a great place at an amazing price. We've stayed at the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental (chosen by Hotwire) a few times, and it's never been less than extraordinary. This time, however, Hotwire was too expensive in that part of the city. Email me with any questions!",15-Aug-04,3
"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel. We got a great rate through priceline. Because we had a reduced rate, we were OK with the extra charges... like $10 a day for internet access and expensive valet parking. Overall we found the staff to be friendly and the 2 occasions we used valet parking the car was waiting for us when we got to there. Like previous reviewers we found the system that automatically recorded purchases from the mini bar odd, and based on previous reviews we discarded our wine bottle out side of the hotel to avoid the 'corkage fee'. Our room was a bit small, but was comfortable for two people. Also the window to our balcony opened, and we were able to step outside onto it - which was a little scary even on the 10th floor. The view was great from our room, we could see from one side of the bay to the other. Our room was also quiet. The location was great, we were a block away from the cable car and major bus routes were near by. There is also plenty to do and see in the immediate vicinity. For breakfast we reccomend both of the cafe's within a block of the hotel, the croissants were great. (Sutter and Grant, and Sutter and Powell)",12-Aug-04,5
"Our four day stay at the Hyatt served its purpose - a clean, well located place to stay. The concierge is fantastic - friendly, informative. We were in a room on the third floor our first night that was dissapointing - clean but old. The front desk was very accomodating to switch us to a better room for the next three nights.The thing that bugged me about this place is the minibar. I took a water out of the fridge, and planned to replace it with one purched for 70% less at Walgreens (call me cheap but I won't pay $5.00 for a water). A guy showed up at the door with the exact item I took from the fridge. Spooky! I saw that the fridge and snacks have a sensor for when a product is removed. What if you just pick it up?? In addition, if they find that you have consumed an ""outside"" bottle of wine or beer they charge you a $50 ""corkage fee"". Do they go through your garbage? Is this weird or what?",2-Aug-04,3
"Trip Advisor was very helpful.... we went with this hotel not because of TripA's review but because we got a really great price (with Priceline $75.00)...the bad part was the parking rate $w/tax was $49.00 a night! ,Still..was a great deal, close to Chinatown and beautiful views from the room...Lobby a bit boring, but the staff was friendly and offered great restaurant ideas....",2-Aug-04,4
"We have just returned from a 5 day stay at The Grand Hyatt and it proved to be a great choice for our family to explore San Francisco on our first visit to the city.The family room was by far the largest we have stayed in (holiday has included staying in New York and Las Vegas as well) and was extremely light due to one wall being nearly all glass. The bathroom was clean and modern and had a very good shower. Check in was efficient and all the staff that we dealt with during our stay were polite and helpful. We found the staff on the Concierge Desk very knowledgeable and full of useful advice for visiting attractions and finding places to eat. They even managed to get us a last minute reservation at Kokkari, the famous Greek restaurant on Jackson Street.We bought MUNI city passes for the week and Stockton Street is conveniently situated on several major bus routes including the No. 30 for Fisherman's Wharf, Palace of Fine Arts and also Powell Street is only minutes away for the cable cars. Many attractions including SOMOMA, Steinhart Aquarium and Yerba Buena Gardens are in easy walking distance from the hotel.Union Square is a great place for shopping and guests of the Grand Hyatt get a 11% discount on purchases from Maceys. There are also a good selection of cafes and diners by the hotel if you don't want to use the hotel for breakfast. We used the Grand Views Restaurant on the 36th Floor for dinner one night and the food was very good. Worth going up just to take in the views across the city, including Alcatraz.If we get the opportunity to return to San Francisco, we would certainly consider using The Grand Hyatt again.Incidentally, people were arriving at the hotel and then disappointed that they were unable to get tickets for Alcatraz because they hadn't booked well ahead. We booked tickets on the internet in April to visit on the 28th July but amazingly people on our ferry said they got last minute tickets because some tickets are released every day at Pier 39 if you are prepared to queue at the start of the day.",31-Jul-04,5
"What a disappointment! The room was average and clean, but not what we expected from stays at other Hyatts. The biggest disappoinment were all the extra charges and the staff. I know parking in S.F. is at a premium, but $39 plus tax for valet is a bit steep. The valet staff informed us we could park in the parking garage across the street for $28, but you had to pay everytime you left and returned. We decided to do this the first night, but found out the next morning it only cost $10 dollars. It does vary according to how long you are parked, but we never paid more than $18 for the day and left a couple of times. We found this to be misleading info from the valet staff. The only issue is that it can be a little confusing to get to, even though you can see it from the front of the hotel. Next, when we checked in, the woman at the check-in desk never said hello, welcome, or thank you! When we asked to be put on the highest floor available, she loudly announced that we had booked at a discounted rate and we couldn't go past the 12th floor. We weren't asking for the penthouse! This made us feel unwelcomed, because we didn't pay full price. As for room amenities, they do provide a coffee maker, but you have to pay for the generic coffee! I have stayed a several upscale hotels and never had to pay. Your best bet is to go to Starbucks across the street. This hotel maybe good for business travelers, because of the convenient location. However, if you are on a budget or prefer to spend your money on fun things ( like us!) you might want to stay elsewhere.",28-Jul-04,2
"We stayed here in April 2004 and although it was a nice hotel, it was nothing special. It seemed like a good hotel for business traveler's, as there were many conventioners staying there at the same time we were. The room was clean but ordinary. We had some issues with the shower going from scalding to freezing and our tv had problems. I would avoid eating at the restaurant. The food was mediocre, although the view was astounding (there's a bar there too, worth getting a drink at to enjoy the panoramic views of San Francisco). Parking was pricey and when we'd call to have the car waiting for us, we'd end up waiting several minutes for it once we got downstairs. The one plus to this hotel was the location. Right near Union Square, it was a great place to walk from, although there weren't very many restaurants nearby. Overall, it was an ordinary experience and I'd definitely stay somewhere else next time.",28-Jul-04,3
"Stayed here over the 4th of July weekend. Lovely place in the Heart of San Francisco next to Union Square. The room was nice well decorated, shower was Great, There is a nice mini-bar fridge and also the coffee and cups are complimentary. Coffee pot sits in the bathroom next to the TV in the Bathroom. Drapes were Heavy enough to sleep in and not be bothered by the noise or light. A Good diner to eat at is Lori's Diner a block away from the hotel. Good prices and good hot meals. Shopping is out for me unless I find a sale, as the prices at Saks, Macy's and Neimen Marcus were outragously ridiculous, who is going to pay $2,000 for a dress or suit jacket you can get at Marshalls for $50 or less. Yes all Designer names but who has that kind of Money- not someone reading the reviews at Trip Advisor trying to find out where the best places are for your money. Enjoy your trip.",6-Jul-04,5
"This is a very exciting hotel to stay at. It is a block north of Union Square. Close to all the big stores and the theaters. The subway and BART are just up the street. We checked in right at 3:00 and were provided a room on the 23rd floor with sweeping views of the city, Transamerica building, and bay. All rooms at this hotel have a great view since the hotel is in the middle of the city. Be sure to go to the 36th floor for a cocktail in the lounge up there. The lounge has breathtaking views of the bay, Alcatraz, Coit Tower, Mark Hopkins, Fairmont, etc. The room was well appointed; modern decor, comfortable surroundings. The staff was friendly and courteous. They do need more elevators but that was only a slight bother. I would love to stay here again.",3-Jul-04,5
"This is a great business hotel! I have stayed here dozens of times and rarely had any negative experiences. Rates have varied between $99 and $229 but it is generally worth it. The rooms are well appointed, have comfortable beds and large bathrooms. Higher floors have great views. Try to get a corner room. The staff are efficient and friendly. Breakfast on the top floor is enjoyable and the service very good. (Try the Eggs Benedict) The public areas are a bit lacking but you are right on Union Square so it is easy to wander out. The Regency Club is nothing special. The rooms are no different and the lounge has plain continental breakfast offerings and a honor bar. It is smallish and not worth it. A final item to point out is the the building can sway like most in San Francisco and high winds can create a mild creaking noise in the rooms from the minute sway of the building. You will not feel it but you can hear it. Lower floors get a fair bit of street noise. All in all a good hotel.",12-Jun-04,4
"I've stayed in a number of the 4**** hotels in San Francisco and I thought this was one of the better ones. Fantastic location, just one block North of Union Square. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. ",7-Jun-04,4
"My husband and I just returned from a 6 night stay at the Grand Hyatt, and it was wonderful. It was our first visit to San Francisco, and we were celebrating our 3rd anniversary, so I asked for a higher-level floor room with king sized bed upon check-in, and they gave us a great room on the 23rd floor, with a view of the city and the water, for guestroom rates! Once in the room, totally exhausted from taking a 7 a.m. flight from NY, needing a nap desperately, I phoned housekeeping to ask if they had a pair of slippers, as I had forgotten mine. Within 10 minutes they brought me a new pair of slippers! Room was very clean and lots of towels in the bathroom. The concierge desk was also fabulous - we left our Pac Bell game tickets home, so they directed us to the business office where we were able to go online to get a customer service number for the park, call them, and arrange for a new set of tickets to be printed. We ordered room service one night, and the food was very good, and arrived at the room within 20 minutes. Couldn't have asked for a better hotel at the price we paid - about $120 a night on Expedia. A real bargain. And there was a Starbucks right across the street, and cable car stop around the corner! If we ever go back to SF, we will definitely stay here.",3-Jun-04,4
"I am normally always impressed with Hyatt. This hotel, though, was merely average. The AAA Four Diamond really through me a curve. I was expecting a AAA Four Diamond hotel, but this Hyatt clearly is not. The hotel has no recreational facilities. The restaurant options on site are limited. (With itâ€™s great central location in Union Square, off site restaurants are abundant.) The lobby is somewhat small and cramped, and the elevators are extremely slow. Although the facility was lacking, the concierge staff was very helpful and the hotelâ€™s location is perfect. The theatre district, Market Street, and China Town are all within walking distance. Other trendy neighborhoods like Fishermanâ€™s Wharf and the Castro District are easily accessible by streetcar or subway. This Hyatt was a very acceptable Three Diamond Hotel. And I donâ€™t mind a Three Diamond Hotel, unless Iâ€™m expecting a Four Diamond.",31-May-04,2
"I stayed 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt SF in April. The hotel has a great location off Union Square, convenient for most of the main attractions.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly - I guess this is something which can vary from trip to trip.The room was a good sized king, on the 25th floor, overlooking Harry Dentons Starlight Room! No problems with traffic noise. Shower and facilities were all good.Only minor blight was being awoken by housekeeping at 10am on a Sunday morning because another guest had removed the ""do not disturb"" sign from our room door... Not the hotels fault, of course.I'd certainly return to this hotel (and indeed am planning my next SF trip right now!).",30-May-04,3
"Just came back from one night at the Grand Hyatt in S.F. We had tickets for The Lion King and wanted to make it a great evening with a stay at a nice hotel. We went online and selected the Grand Hyatt. The Lion King was OUTSTANDING... the Hyatt was marginal. First thing the registration clerk did was to try to get us to stay the night in the ""living room portion of a suite"" as an alternative to our confirmed reservation. But when we said no, a fairly nice room was provided at the rate we had confirmed. My wife and I were mostly disappointed in the lack of the little things. There were minimal ammenities in the room. I've stayed at many less expensive hotels and the ammenities were much nicer. I guess the thing that bothered us the most was that there was a small coffee maker int the room but no coffee. I made a specific trip to the registration desk to request the coffee and was told it would be there before morning. Well as you probably figured out it never showed up. I know it's a small thing, but I expected more out of the Hyatt. I'll try another place next time we go to the City.",16-May-04,3
"We stayed at this hotel the first week in April. The staff was courteous and always willing to help us. Service was always with a smile. The Grandview restaurant was excellent with attentive service from Richard our waiter. Great location, close to shopping. Would stay at again.",23-Apr-04,5
"Just returned from San Francisco trip. San Francisco is worth a trip, incredible place. We had high 80's temp and cool at night of course. The Grand Hyatt is an ok hotel, nothing special except the excellent location off Union Square. You can get there on the Bart (train system from the airport that is 4.95 cents per person, then a short walk to the hotel. You can get to all areas of tourist interest within a few blocks to transportation for 1.35 per person under 18 is only .35. We felt safe all around. The conceirge was excellent with advice on how to get to all locations. The front desk was unfriendly, esp. guest services. We checked our bags in to hold until our plane and we were counting the bags and she made fun of us like we couldn't count. She told the bell hop that we had 6-7-8 whatever they don't know, right in front of us. That was unacceptable. Upon return, I might check out a different hotel around Union SQ. But, expedia does offer great deals.",22-Mar-04,2
"Stayed at the Hyatt over Valentine's Day weekend 2004. The best thing about the hotel is the location. Its central to everything. The room was clean, the room service food was tasty and the staff was very helpful. They were able to find me a reservation at a top restaurant on Valentine's Day which is next to impossible. I would stay here again.",17-Mar-04,3
"Booked trip through Travelocity, initially on the fourth floor but was moved to 22 nd floor when we checked in. Service generally good but disturbed by the daily ""Minibar checks"" with a person knocking on the door while we were still in the room sleeping! We also got charged for items we did not take. The rooms were moderately spacious but not exciting.",29-Feb-04,3
"The Grand Hyatt at Union Square is a good location. The hotel itself is average. The staff was helpful, and the rooms were clean. I don't understand how several rating groups rate this hotel a 4 star hotel. I would say 3 stars easily, but the rating of 4 stars is not accurate. You will be disappointed if you think you are going to stay at a real 4 star hotel. If you book an upgraded room ,make sure that is what you get, it seems like Hyatts' try to down-grade the room you purchased. The location around Union Square was really good, we felt safe,plenty of shopping,and food that you could walk to. The cable and trolleys were ony a block or two away.",17-Feb-04,3
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt through a Hotwire rate of only $79 plus plus. It was totally worth it, as this hotel is located just one block north of Union Square, steps to all the great chain-store shopping in the city. Market Street is only four blocks away, so transit is easily accessible. While the hotel itself is hardly anything unique, it is good, quality Hyatt fare: clean rooms, well-maintained lobby, standard services. As always, the higher the floor, the better the view and less street noise. I'd definitely be a repeat customer if the price was right!",19-Jan-04,4
"I used the reviews from this website and booked a rather expensive Regency Club room. What a mistake. Dated 2 star hotel trying to be a 4 star. The location is great, but on the 30th floor, I could easily hear the street traffic due to a lack of modern glazed window glass. Add on the noise I could hear from rooms above, and I could say it was one of the biggest hotel disappoinments I have had. After not sleeping, I called the Four Seasons and got a room in there at 9:00 AM. What a hotel. With their Holiday rate it was $80/night more than the Hyatt, but absolutely incompararable. I felt like I moved from a 30 some odd story buget hotel to the Taj Mahal.",29-Dec-03,2
"The grand Hyatt is my sure stay every time in San Francisco, good service, big room, good location and they have the best executive lounge in S.F....good ""real"" food, free Starbuck and Great view. I think Hyatt need to open a class teach other hotel how to run the executive lounge...ha, five stars.",22-Oct-03,5
"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 nights @ $199/nt not too shabby for ""Frisco"" and yeah the SF newspaper told me it's now hip to say ""Frisco"" so don't get too excited...Checkin was fast and easy. Asked for low floor and got it. Yeah i know that makes for lousy view but I hate waiting in elevators. .. Television was AWFUL staticky and blurry. Complained modestly but didn't care as only slept in the room. Room was otherwise great with an L shape into the bathroom. (Bedroom then small hallway with sink and then bathroom) this was a regular one king bed room. . . Good Climate Control. Great Location. Walked to Union Square, ChinaTown, Moscone Center, Cablecars, Restaurants, car rental locations. . . . .blah blah blah Felt safe at night. No gift shop available, but many stores nearby. Cool hotel top bar and restaurant for views.",18-Oct-03,4
"We stayed here for 3 nights. Ideally located in Union square, centre of town. Excellent base for sight seeing, cable car terminus, shopping and restaurants. Hotel itself is very clean and well managed. Friendly and efficient staff. Recommended for short stay. If you need a stiff drink, try the ""Ultimate Martini"".",3-Oct-03,4
This a great hotel and the service was excellant. The rooms were a little small but the great service and view from the 25th floor made up for it. At first i was worried about how we would get around town without a car but the cable cars where right around the corner from the hotel. It was easy getting to fishermans wharf and china town. Union Square is also the best location for shopping.,29-Sep-03,4
My 8/28 - 9/1 stay at the Grand Hyatt was just fantastic! I have nothing negative to say about this hotel --- everything was great! The front desk staff was very nice and gave me an 18th floor room with an awesome view of Union Square. The Grandviews Restaurant on the 36th floor had excellent food and service. I will definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt again. It exceeded my expectations.,3-Sep-03,5
"Excellent hotel...1st Class...Great Location close to Union Square, China Town, Cable Car. Got a good deal on rate too.",1-Sep-03,4
"PLUS: Very beautiful, modern hotel. 20 second walk to Union Square shopping, dining, et cetera. 5 minute walk to China Towne. Little TV in the bathroom-BIG PLUS! Very clean rooms. Firm bed. Excellent views from 36th floor restaurant/bar. This is a 4-Star hotel and is great if you don't mind splurging a little for your trip. Staff was very helpful and prompt. :-)MINUS: Valet parking fee is a lot. They did not have the room we paid for even though we booked our trip 2 months in advance. So we Rock/Paper/Scissors to see who would get the smaller room with 1 Bed. Winning people got (2) Double beds-bigger room. :-(",24-Aug-03,5
"My wife, 3 kids and I stayed 17 - 21 Aug 2003 and found almost everything to be very good. Location is on the corner of Union Square with Macys, Tiffanys and Saks just 2 minutes around the corner, with the cable car also on Union Square and good cab and bus connections right outside the entrance. $35 for overnight parking by the hotel but in the next street along there's a multi storey where you can park from 7pm to 7am for $6 and $2 for every extra hour that you want to lie in bed. Alamo car hire is a couple of blocks away but closes at 7pm. Hotel Desk service was helpful and responded to a little friendly arm twisting to get exactly what I wanted. 2 restaurants for breakfast $2 - $3 for cereal / muffins on the mezzanine and $12 - $15 for a cooked breakfast on the 36th floor. Rooms were adequate but not spacious. Immediate surrounding area has many restaurants and diners to cater for all tastes. Checkout by 12 noon but suitcases can be left at no charge if you have a later departure. Free to use room safe for valuables.",24-Aug-03,4
"the price was good so for the price we paid, it was a decent hotel. i am guessing that all hotels in SF have small rooms. they also had internet connection which was useful. Also, very close to all attractions.",15-Aug-03,4
"My husband and I had a very pleasant experience, the staff was nice and helpful. The location was great! We will definitely stay here again for more Union Square shopping!",9-Aug-03,4
"We got a good deal at the Grand Hyatt through hotwire.com; as a result we were pleased with the accomodations and the location was excellent. The front desk service was not very friendly, but the concierge was excellent and very helpful. If we had paid regular room rates we may have been disappointed at the room size and service.",30-Jul-03,4
"An unimpressive hotel with horrible beds and it just feels dirty. Close to shopping but that still is not a good enough reason to stay there, just don't.",2-Jul-03,2
"This is a well located hotel, right on Union Square, close to Chinatown and a short cab or cable car ride to Fisherman's Wharf.The rooms are spacious and clean, and the breakfast in the Grandviews restaurant was excellent, with spectacular views over the Bay from its 36th floor location.",25-Jun-03,4
"This Hotel is wonderful, Great location just steps from china town. The only draw back was having to pay 40.00 a night for parking but we would have to pay that price anywhere in San Francisco. The staff is wonderful. Left something behind and they had it in the Lost and Found within an hour. They sent it back UPS. This is a very nice hotel.",13-Jun-03,5
"We spent our anniversery at the Grand Hyatt and had a wonderfull stay. Check in was fast, friendly and efficient, we used our Free nights Faster credits for 4 free nights, and because it was our anniversery we were upgraded to the Club level. The view form the 31st floor was amazing, the lounge was beautiful, breakfast and evening snacks were very good, and the room comfortable. We found the bed very good, the room was made up early, bus stops for everywhere we wanted to go was handy. The only bad note was the speed of the elevators, they were very slow, and the doors closed very fast, you had to rush to get in. If you bring a car parking is also very expensive, we took the bus, cable car or street car were ever we went, with the pass very inexpensive and much easier.",3-Jun-03,5
"Having travelled in many Grand Hyatt Hotels, I had very high expectations of this particular property. I have to admit that the staff is by far the best asset for the hotel. Very impressed by the Front desk receptionist. I had a emergency during my stay but she made it a point to ensure that I was comfortable and I have never experienced such personal service in many months. I would definetely recommend this hotel to business and leisure traveller. Although this Grand Hyatt is very diffrerent from the ones in Asia and Resort like Grand Hyatts, it has a unique style that I would recommend. Breathtaking views, excellent room features and very competent staff.",4-Feb-03,5
